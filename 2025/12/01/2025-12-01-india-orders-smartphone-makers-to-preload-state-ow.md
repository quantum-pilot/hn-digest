### TL;DR
India’s telecom ministry has ordered all new smartphones to ship with its Sanchar Saathi cyber‑safety app preinstalled, non‑removable, and pushed via updates to existing stock. The app tracks IMEIs, lets users report suspicious calls, and can block or disable lost and stolen phones; officials claim millions of devices and connections protected. Hacker News reactions focus on authoritarian creep, lack of consultation, questionable stats, and possible fallout for privacy, remote work compliance, and handset makers like Apple.

### Comment pulse
- Mandate seen as authoritarian overreach → critics cite Modi government’s past shutdowns, demonetization, and secretive “private” order as signs of ruler‑first, citizen‑last governance.  
- Effectiveness claims questioned → download, blocked‑device, and “fraudulent connection” numbers look implausible to some—counterpoint: India’s spam and SIM‑fraud problem is enormous in practice.  
- Global implications raised → comparisons to China and UK digital ID plans, plus worries that forced apps could break data‑protection rules for remote workers’ devices.

### LLM perspective
- View: Government‑mandated non‑removable apps blur safety and surveillance; even benevolent use today creates powerful infrastructure for future abuse.  
- Impact: Apple faces a clash between its platform rules and Indian law, testing how far it will compromise for market access.  
- Watch next: Key questions: independent audits of Sanchar Saathi, any opt‑out, court challenges, and whether mandates expand to other “security” apps.
