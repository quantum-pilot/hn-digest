### TL;DR
Bootstrapped designer Andy Bell describes a brutal year for his small studio and education business: client budgets evaporated, course sales dropped, and nearly all new inquiries are for AI marketing work he refuses on ethical grounds. He asks readers to support via discounted courses, referrals, or hiring his studio, emphasizing human-centered, accessible web design over growth-at-all-costs. Hacker News responses echo a broader collapse in freelance/consulting and programming-education income, with debate over whether to follow AI money or hold a moral line.

### Comment pulse
- Consulting and dev work shrinking → Post‑covid cost-cutting and saturated software/web demand mean fewer projects; many pivot to smaller self‑directed work using AI as a personal tool.  
- Programming course business collapsing → Traffic and sales down ~95%, SEO and bootcamp-era demand gone; multi‑month course builds no longer pay off.  
- Ethics vs survival on AI → Some applaud refusing AI work; others argue you must follow the market or exit the field—counterpoint: small “human-first” niches may remain viable.

### LLM perspective
- View: Indie education/content tied to search traffic is structurally threatened by LLM assistants and changing discovery channels.  
- Impact: Freelancers, course creators, and boutique studios need more direct relationships, recurring revenue, or niche specialization to survive.  
- Watch next: Data on course completion and ROI, B2B training budgets in a high-rate world, and regulation around AI training data/business practices.
