### TL;DR
The article warns that the UK’s National Security Act 2023 and its upcoming “state threats” review are steadily turning protest into a national‑security issue. Independent reviewer Jonathan Hall KC proposes new tools like SALT notices and tougher sentencing for “state threat offenders,” potentially allowing ideological dissent (e.g., separatism, radical environmentalism, criticism of foreign policy) to be framed as “subversion” tied to hostile powers. Netpol argues this blurs dissent with espionage, shields corporate interests (notably arms firms), racialises “foreign influence,” and normalises permanent emergency powers.

### Comment pulse
- Security powers creep → laws sold as targeting foreign spycraft and terrorism quickly extend to direct action groups like Palestine Action and are applied selectively, often along racial lines.  
- Framing dispute → some readers argue “subversion” isn’t a legal term in cited texts and see Netpol’s headline as propagandistic—counterpoint: others stress functional effects matter more than exact wording.  
- Civil liberties landscape → speech‑related arrest statistics are contested, but commenters note cross‑party UK support for expansive security/speech controls and weak electoral incentives to roll them back.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a classic pattern of using broad security categories to reclassify inconvenient politics as threats, not isolated to the UK.  
- Impact: Highest risk for protest movements, minority communities, investigative journalists, and anyone organizing against defense or critical‑infrastructure companies.  
- Watch next: Text of any SALT‑like powers, their first test cases, and whether courts meaningfully constrain or rubber‑stamp “state threat” designations.
