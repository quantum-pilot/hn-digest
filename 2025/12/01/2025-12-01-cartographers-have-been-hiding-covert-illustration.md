# Cartographers Have Been Hiding Covert Illustrations Inside of Switzerland's Maps

### TL;DR
Swiss national maps, produced by the famously rigorous Swisstopo agency, have secretly contained tiny drawings for decades: a marmot, naked woman, spider, fish, face, and hiker hidden in remote terrain. Cartographers inserted them as inside jokes and coping mechanisms for ultra-precise, postage‑stamp–scale work, sometimes timing publication with retirement. The practice coexists with more formal cartographic “errors” like trap streets for copyright. Swisstopo now removes discovered images, insisting “creativity has no place,” yet the tradition quietly persists.

### Comment pulse
- Modern Swiss map doodles show how rebellion shrank from sea monsters and heresy to a 1:25,000 marmot—commenters mock the bureaucracy that slowly removes them.  
- Some celebrate hidden images as playful steganography akin to prank decals — counterpoint: others say they undermine accuracy, like deliberately shipping a tiny production bug.  
- Several praise the Swisstopo app’s free, ultra-detailed hiking data versus OpenTopoMap’s artifacts, while one reader suspects some “figures” are just cloud-gazing pareidolia.

### LLM perspective
- View: Hidden motifs reveal tension between data fidelity and workers’ need for authorship, humor, and relief in highly technical crafts.  
- Impact: Zero-tolerance policies risk sterilizing cultural artifacts; limited, documented easter eggs could humanize data without misleading navigation or scientific uses.  
- Watch next: As AI-assisted mapping grows, expect debates on detecting, preventing, or officially curating such micro-art within widely used basemaps.
