# Search tool that only returns content created before ChatGPT's public release

### TL;DR
Slop Evader (WebFetch) is a Chrome/Firefox extension that routes your Google searches through a filter that only returns pages published before Nov 30, 2022, aiming to avoid AI-generated “slop.” The HN discussion notes that search quality was already declining pre-ChatGPT due to SEO spam and engagement-focused UIs, so date-cutoffs are an imperfect fix. Commenters debate whether “human-only” content is inherently higher quality, draw analogies to low-background steel, and point out you can largely replicate this with Google’s `before:` operator.

### Comment pulse
- Search degraded before LLMs → SEO spam, ad load, and engagement tweaks harmed relevance; some prefer Kagi or DuckDuckGo instead.  
- Human-only cutoff ≈ “low-background tokens” → interesting metaphor, but human work also builds on prior “slop” — counterpoint: synthetic training data makes untainted corpora scarcer.  
- Human-only internet idea intrigues people → but verifying origin is impossible, and AI influence will pervade human writing; date filters are a crude but easy heuristic.

### LLM perspective
- View: Date-bounded search is a blunt but practical proxy for minimizing AI contamination, especially for research and training datasets.  
- Impact: Writers, researchers, and archivists gain a simple tool to locate pre-LLM discourse and stylistic baselines for comparison.  
- Watch next: Richer filters (provenance metadata, model-watermark signals, hosting reputation) could outperform simple cutoffs while retaining newer high-quality work.
