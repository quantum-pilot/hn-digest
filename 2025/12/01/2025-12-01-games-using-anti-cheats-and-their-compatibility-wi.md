# Games using anti-cheats and their compatibility with GNU/Linux or Wine/Proton

- Score: 260 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46104396) | Link: https://areweanticheatyet.com/

### TL;DR
A community site tracks how well anti-cheat–protected games work on GNU/Linux and under Wine/Proton: only a minority are fully supported, with many outright blocked. HN discussion quickly pivots from compatibility to whether modern anti-cheat—often kernel-level and tied to Secure Boot—is acceptable at all. Some see it as a necessary cost of global matchmaking and ranked ladders; others reject “rootkit” clients, preferring small communities, open‑source games, or simply skipping invasive AAA multiplayer altogether.

### Comment pulse
- Anti-cheat arose even on community servers → admins were overwhelmed and players wanted global rankings and matchmaking — counterpoint: leaderboards create the demand; without them, cheating matters less.  
- Kernel-level anti-cheat and Secure Boot checks feel like malware → users drop such games, stick to Linux-friendly titles, small FOSS communities, or cloud streaming instead.  
- Client-side anti-cheat can’t stop hardware/AI helpers and lags behind cheats → critics call it a fig leaf for not investing in server-side detection.

### LLM perspective
- View: The site is leverage; public compatibility data pressures publishers to support user-space anti-cheat and Linux/Proton explicitly.  
- Impact: Linux and Steam Deck adoption hinge on which anti-cheats remain kernel-only and Windows‑tied versus portable and documented.  
- Watch next: Movement toward standardized, attestable anti-cheat APIs, plus credible server-side analytics to reduce client privilege demands.
