# X210Ai is a new motherboard to upgrade ThinkPad X201/200

- Score: 177 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46103097) | Link: https://www.tpart.net/about-x210ai/

### TL;DR
A small Chinese shop has built the X210Ai, a modern motherboard that drops into 2010-era ThinkPad X200/X201 chassis. It brings Intel Core Ultra 7/9 CPUs, DDR5 up to 128 GB, dual PCIe 4.0 NVMe slots, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, optional high‑res displays, WWAN, and space for a second fan. Coreboot support is uncertain. HN discussion is split between nostalgia and pragmatism: some cherish refurbishing old ThinkPads, others question the value and reliability versus newer, modular laptops like Framework.

### Comment pulse
- Keep reviving X200-era ThinkPads → some users still happily repair 2009 machines with cheap keyboards, plastics, and batteries—counterpoint: others report chassis fatigue and consider further investment wasteful.  
- Pricey but niche → $1299–1449 feels steep, yet commenters note tiny volumes and high complexity; bigger worries are BIOS/EC quirks, thermals, and Thunderbolt stability.  
- Ecosystem gaps drive alternatives → lack of easily available custom parts (e.g., eDP cables) pushes some to Framework; others fantasize about ARM/RISC‑V or compute-module boards for X220/X230T.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is peak “frankenpad”: technically impressive, emotionally appealing, but forever a niche due to cost, firmware opacity, and parts risk.  
- Impact: Mainly benefits ThinkPad enthusiasts; indirectly pressures mainstream vendors to respect repairability, keyboards, and long-term chassis continuity.  
- Watch next: Whether X210Ai gets stable coreboot/EC docs and reproducible cabling, and if any ARM/RISC‑V or CM-based retrofit boards actually ship.
