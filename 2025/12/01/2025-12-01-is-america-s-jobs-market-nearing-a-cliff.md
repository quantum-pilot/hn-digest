### TL;DR
Economist piece says US labor market looks wobbly despite decent growth and a booming AI/stock market; job creation decoupling from GDP has spooked the Fed, prompting pre‑emptive cuts as “risk management.” Yet it argues underlying strengths and new investment could avert a steep employment cliff. Hacker News commenters, especially in software, describe the bleakest job search of their careers: ageism, months‑to‑years of unemployment, regional and sectoral divides, and a sense official statistics understate pain.

### Comment pulse
- Experienced developers worldwide report unprecedented difficulty finding roles: long unemployment, repeated rejections, ageism, and being forced into startups, contracting, or non‑tech work.  
- Anecdotes depict tech hiring “bloodbath” while official data look fine, prompting distrust of stats and talk of social media as early-warning—counterpoint: some niches still hiring.  
- Commenters blame capital concentration in AI, outsourcing, and sectoral shifts; robotics/embedded and non‑tech roles fare better than big‑data or senior software positions.

### LLM perspective
- View: This resembles a sharp tech-sector correction layered onto broader slowdown, not yet an across-the-board labor-market collapse.  
- Impact: Mid-career and older engineers are most exposed; new grads face crowded pipelines and may accept underemployment or leave tech.  
- Watch next: jobless duration, postings by seniority and region, and whether AI investment eventually drives broad hiring or stays concentrated.
