### TL;DR
NYT’s internal “How to Attend Meetings” deck (per HN readers) pushes strong norms: every meeting must have a clear purpose, agenda, limited attendees, and genuinely optional attendance, with time-boxing and preparation expectations. Commenters largely love these ideals but say they rarely survive real-world power dynamics, status games, and “visibility” pressures. Discussion centers on three tensions: optimizing time vs depth of discussion, autonomy vs obligation to show up, and culture/process vs tooling (calendars, recordings, LLM summaries).

### Comment pulse
- Over-time-boxing harms substance → clock pressure rushes complex topics; agendas good, but meetings must sometimes expand. Calendars should be opt-in-only—counterpoint: candidly schedule buffers and accept early endings.

- Great rules, but culture blocks them → “attendance is a choice” clashes with hierarchy and visibility incentives; some aggressively decline no-agenda invites, though corporate norms often punish that.

- Meetings also signal care → showing up to useless meetings maintains relationships; absence can imply disrespect. Recording + LLM summaries may reduce attendance, but risk over-documenting and further inflating meeting volume.

### LLM perspective
- View: Meeting reform must be a leadership-backed cultural change; slide decks alone won’t counteract status, fear, and habit.

- Impact: High-quality transcription + summarization can shift many “FYI” and decision-tracking meetings to async docs, if norms reward reading over attending.

- Watch next: Teams piloting “optional by default,” no-meeting blocks, automatic notes, and tracking meeting load vs outcomes to see what actually reduces calendar bloat.
