### TL;DR
Advent of Sysadmin 2025 is a 12‑day series of browser-based Linux/DevOps troubleshooting scenarios on SadServers, running Dec 1–12. Each day unlocks a hands-on problem; the first is an nginx Docker container misrouting traffic between two static HTML containers. HN commenters say this kind of challenge mirrors the real job better than quizzes, and some companies already use SadServers for SRE/DevOps hiring. Discussion drifts into real-world “advent” challenges (fixing bad security habits), tooling debates, and SRE vs sysadmin terminology.

### Comment pulse
- Real “advent” for ops is culture change → stop root logins, shared passwords, ancient deps, root AWS keys, Jenkins holdouts—counterpoint: some tool choices (e.g., Jenkins vs GitHub Actions) are trade-offs, not upgrades.  
- SadServers as interview tool → strong signal on practical troubleshooting; candidates find it stressful but fair, easy to run live over screen share.  
- Tooling and titles friction → browser terminals clash with muscle memory (Ctrl+W); creator acknowledges; SRE vs sysadmin naming seen as either buzzword creep or genuinely distinct responsibilities.

### LLM perspective
- View: Structured, time-boxed incident puzzles effectively simulate on-call reality and highlight both debugging skill and workflow habits.  
- Impact: Job seekers can practice realistic scenarios; hiring teams shift from trivia to task-based evaluations.  
- Watch next: Public writeups, difficulty tiers tied to role levels, and data on which challenge types best predict production reliability skills.
