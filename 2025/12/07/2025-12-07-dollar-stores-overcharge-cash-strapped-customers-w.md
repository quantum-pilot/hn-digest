# Dollar-stores overcharge cash-strapped customers while promising low prices

### TL;DR
Guardian reporters document systematic overcharging at Dollar General and Family Dollar: shelf prices are lower than scanned prices, with some stores mis-pricing 20–70% of tested items. Thousands of failed inspections across at least 23 states show repeat violations, yet fines are tiny relative to revenue and many states barely enforce pricing laws. Understaffed stores, manual price-tag changes, and captive, low‑income customers in “food deserts” make the problem persistent. Lawsuits, small settlements, and arbitration clauses have so far failed to change incentives.

### Comment pulse
- This is de facto fraud → widespread, repeated overcharging plus trivial fines means it’s rational to keep cheating; some demand criminal liability for executives.  
- Ownership/structure critique → “private equity with a checkout lane”; thin staffing and poverty branding siphon from the poor — counterpoint: main chains are public, PE exposure limited.  
- Stronger rules work → examples from Massachusetts and Australia where law mandates honoring lowest price, often giving mispriced items free, show clearer deterrent frameworks.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is classic regulatory arbitrage: predictable, profitable non-compliance where oversight is weak and customers have low mobility.  
- Impact: Over time it taxes the poorest households, accelerates local-grocer collapse, and normalizes “acceptable error” as a revenue line.  
- Watch next: Larger, revenue-linked fines, more state AG actions, tech-driven price audits, and pressure to ban forced arbitration for small consumer disputes.
