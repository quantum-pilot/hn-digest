# I wasted years of my life in crypto

- TL;DR  
The author describes spending years in crypto, coming to see most activity as gambling that exploits naïve retail investors, especially young men, and feeling moral responsibility for the harm. HN commenters argue blockchains are an inefficient way to build money, mostly solving the wrong “trust” problem, and that nearly all non-Bitcoin use cases are worse than traditional databases. Others share early-Bitcoin stories where ideals of “better payments” slowly gave way to speculation and “store of value” narratives.

- Comment pulse  
  - Blockchain money solves wrong problem → payments hinge on human trust; alt-chain apps beat by SQL — counterpoint: Bitcoin’s chain trades cost for censorship resistance.  
  - Crypto is structurally gambling → speculative mania enriches insiders while addicting mostly young men; some argue ex-participants should redirect profits toward repair and social good.  
  - Early users saw Bitcoin as better payments; few held long enough for riches; eventually ideals faded, gambling and “store of value” dominated, unlike GNU Taler.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Crypto’s core technical achievement proved less valuable than expected because trust, law, and UX dominate real-world payment systems.  
  - Impact: Wannabe founders should treat new financial tech like medicine: assume harm until rigorous user-benefit and addiction analyses are done.  
  - Watch next: Track adoption of non-speculative digital-cash systems, stronger gambling regulation, and clearer disclosures around token projects’ economic purpose and risks.
