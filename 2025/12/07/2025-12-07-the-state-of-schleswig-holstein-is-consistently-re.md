# The state of Schleswig-Holstein is consistently relying on open source

- Score: 503 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46181491) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/Goodbye-Microsoft-Schleswig-Holstein-relies-on-Open-Source-and-saves-millions-11105459.html

### TL;DR
Schleswig-Holstein is replacing most Microsoft software in its state administration with LibreOffice and other open-source tools, cancelling about 80% of MS licenses (tax systems later). The state expects to save over €15M annually in license fees while investing €9M once in migration and OSS improvements, framed as both cost relief and digital sovereignty. HN commenters welcome a concrete, upstream-only government OSS strategy but argue true sovereignty needs sustained in-house teams, long‑term funding, and avoiding past reversals like Munich’s LiMux.

### Comment pulse
- Open-source funding → Some want savings reinvested into projects; others highlight Schleswig-Holstein’s upstream-only strategy and German programs like ZenDis and the Sovereign Tech Agency.  
- Sovereignty vs surveillance → Many argue governments should standardize on Linux to avoid kill-switches and espionage—counterpoint: states prefer leverage via big-tech partnerships and regulation.  
- Cost narrative and risk → Commenters fear “savings” rhetoric masks underinvestment, repeat of Munich’s LiMux reversal, and productivity losses unless governments build solid in-house teams.

### LLM perspective
- View → This is a rare, large-scale, upstream-focused OSS migration where governance and political coalitions, not tools, are decisive.  
- Impact → If sustained, it could redirect millions from foreign licenses into European OSS ecosystems, contractors, and public-sector engineering roles.  
- Watch next → Track employee satisfaction, rollback risk, and whether Germany scales this model federally using shared components like openDesk.
