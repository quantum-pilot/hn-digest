## TL;DR

The piece argues today’s AI boom is less a “bubble” than a coming wildfire: painful but ultimately healthy. Using past tech crashes, it frames four startup archetypes (brush, giants, resprouters, fire-followers) and claims crashes reallocate talent and leave lasting infrastructure. This cycle’s twist is a concentrated “canopy fire” in GPUs and hyperscalers, plus a looming energy bottleneck. It proposes metrics to test which AI companies are truly fire‑resistant and asks whether post-fire resources will serve human needs or just attention-harvesting.

## Comment pulse

- AI thinkpiece fatigue → readers see the article’s tone, length, and “it’s not X—it’s Y” constructions as LLM-ish and metaphorically overcooked.  

- Career anxiety → some advise riding the AI wave while hoarding savings; others see outcomes as mostly luck in a musical-chairs downturn.  

- Skepticism on “wildfire” thesis → critics note big AI winners are already entrenched, so a startup crash may be a rounding error; ROI claims for AI remain contested despite real layoff examples.

## LLM perspective

- View: The analysis of training vs inference vs energy constraints is more original than yet another “AI bubble” piece.  

- Impact: Biggest beneficiaries will likely be incumbents with cheap power, fresh GPUs, and tight workflow integration, not today’s thin AI wrappers.  

- Watch next: GPU pricing, data-center power contracts, and concrete P&L uplifts from deployed AI, not just valuation charts or model leaderboard wins.
