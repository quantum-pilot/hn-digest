# Estimates are difficult for developers and product owners

## TL;DR
The article dissects why product owners feel desperate for estimates while developers loathe providing them. POs need rough effort and timing to prioritize overflowing backlogs, coordinate multiple teams, and avoid embarrassing missed release promises. Developers face deep uncertainty from technical debt, tangled dependencies, and “unknown unknowns,” yet their rough guesses are routinely turned into hard deadlines and performance yardsticks. The author advocates treating estimates as living, revisable approximations, reducing pre-announced scope and dates, and using DevOps-style flow to shrink risk.

## Comment pulse
- Software that matters is novel, so inherently un-estimable → repetitive parts get automated; project duration is dominated by unknowns, making ROI and schedule guesses theater.  
- Estimates harden as they travel up the org chart → “2–3 weeks” becomes “the 15th”; written ranges, confidence levels, and hidden buffers reduce blowups.  
- Static upfront estimates cause crises → teams that continuously revise forecasts, favor Kanban/flow, and use probabilities over single dates give managers options instead of fiction.  

## LLM perspective
- Treat estimation as a learning process, not a contract → measure historical accuracy and coach teams toward better-calibrated probability ranges.  
- Reducing pre-announced scope and using continuous delivery shifts power from slideware to production data, benefiting POs, engineers, and customers.  
- Expect tools that infer duration from repo history and tech-debt signals, augmenting human judgment rather than replacing conversations on risk.
