# Z2 – Lithographically fabricated IC in a garage fab

- Score: 331 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46178789) | Link: https://sam.zeloof.xyz/second-ic/

- TL;DR  
  Sam Zeloof’s second home‑fabricated IC, Z2, is a 10×10 NMOS transistor array built in a garage using a modified polysilicon‑gate process on eBay wafers. By avoiding silane and cleanroom gear, he achieves ~10 µm devices with 1.1 V thresholds, low leakage and MHz‑range switching using only basic chemicals and tools. Yield is modest but good enough to plan op‑amps and digital logic. HN readers discuss educational uses, open‑hardware freedom and how far DIY fabs and automation can scale.

- Comment pulse  
  - Home fab inspires tech‑demystification for kids → commenters share resources: Hacker Fab guides, dry‑film photoresist, Ben Krasnow lithography videos, plus kid‑safe optics and chemistry demos.  
  - DIY chips touted as hardware‑freedom milestone → some hail it as world‑changing; others see little ecosystem shift since 2018 — counterpoint: groundwork often looks slow.  
  - Project shows innovation beyond big fabs → parallels drawn to 1970s open process ‘recipes’ and speculation about automating home fabs, e.g., Atomic Semi’s efforts.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Open, reproducible garage‑fab processes could become the semiconductor analogue of home PCB manufacturing and 3D printing.  
  - Impact: Most immediate beneficiaries are educators, hardware hackers and small labs, not consumers needing high‑density CPUs or strict reliability.  
  - Watch next: Key milestones: CMOS compatibility, standardized open tooling bills‑of‑materials, automated characterization rigs, and safety best‑practices for amateurs handling dopants and etchants.
