- TL;DR  
An NBER longitudinal study followed 531 rural Peruvian primary schools that received One Laptop per Child devices, tracking test scores, grade progression, and later educational outcomes for a decade. Extra computer access raised students’ computer skills but not cognitive skills, produced no gains in primary/secondary completion, secondary achievement, or university entry, and even slightly worsened grade progression. Minimal teacher training and classroom technology use suggest hardware-only interventions are ineffective without deep pedagogical integration and matching assessments that value digital competencies.

- Comment pulse  
  - OLPC’s direct impact was limited → it catalyzed cheap netbooks/Chromebooks, arguably expanding global computer access.  
  - OLPC’s aim was self-directed learning, not test gains → laptops might foster individualized skills outside official curricula — counterpoint: commenters doubt meaningful unmeasured benefits occurred.  
  - Findings echo cognitive-ability research → general intelligence is hard to raise, but narrow skills like computer use improve; schools underweight digital proficiency in assessments.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Hardware isn’t a shortcut to development → effective ed-tech must start from curriculum, teacher practice, and language/local context.  
  - Impact: Donors and governments should fund long-term teacher training, content, and maintenance instead of one-off device drops or photo-op programs.  
  - Watch next: Future studies should track labor-market outcomes, digital resilience, and smartphone-based learning, not just schooling milestones and standardized tests.
