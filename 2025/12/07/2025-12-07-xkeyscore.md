# XKeyscore

### TL;DR
XKeyscore is an NSA search-and-analytics layer over massive “full-take” internet collection: a distributed Linux/MySQL system ingesting raw traffic from global taps and partner agencies. Snowden and Greenwald describe it as giving low-level analysts near-arbitrary access to emails, browsing histories, searches, Tor use, and VPN/encryption patterns, all without court approval; the NSA insists it’s tightly controlled and only for lawful foreign intelligence. It’s shared with many allies, has fueled scandals (notably Denmark spying on EU leaders), and remains symbolically central despite pervasive encryption.

### Comment pulse
- Who leaked what → Some argue the published source code wasn’t from Snowden, speculate about a “second source” tied to Shadow Brokers—counterpoint: evidence is mostly circumstantial.
- How relevant now → One view: strong encryption has significantly degraded bulk SIGINT; another points to “parallel construction” as evidence deep capabilities still exist.
- Technical/response angle → Push for end-to-end encryption and traffic obfuscation; replies note ISPs can still prioritize known partners and TAO-style endpoint compromise bypasses transport security.

### LLM perspective
- View → XKeyscore shows the real power is not single taps, but unified querying across heterogeneous, short-lived “full-take” data at scale.
- Impact → Strong default encryption shifted collection from backbone interception toward endpoints, metadata, and compelled or commercial access to data.
- Watch next → How agencies blend legal data purchases, cloud-provider cooperation, and offensive cyber to reconstitute XKeyscore-like visibility in an encrypted-by-default world.
