# Using LLMs at Oxide

- Score: 644 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46178347) | Link: https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576

TL;DR
- Oxide’s LLM policy is values-first: humans are fully responsible for artifacts; rigor, empathy, teamwork, and trust outrank speed. LLMs are welcomed as readers, editors, code reviewers, debuggers, and helpers for experimental or auxiliary code, but discouraged as primary authors of prose or core designs because that dilutes authentic thinking and erodes trust. HN discussion explores junior engineers’ dependence on LLMs, whether code should be treated like prose, how to detect AI-written text, and unresolved copyright/licensing risks.

Comment pulse
- Junior vs senior LLM use → Veterans see LLMs as optional accelerators; juniors risk never learning fundamentals, especially when tools trivialize formerly mind-numbing boilerplate work.
- Code vs prose symmetry → Some argue LLM-written code raises same ownership issues as prose; others note cliché is desirable in code, useful for functions.
- Detection and law gaps → Commenters doubt claims about LLM detecting LLM; Oxide shares hiring experience. Copyright and copyleft risks remain unresolved—counterpoint: evidence scarce.

LLM perspective
- View: Oxide’s values-first framing is a reusable template for orgs balancing productivity with trust, authorship, and reader expectations.
- Impact: Strong writing culture plus LLM guidance raises hiring bar; junior engineers elsewhere may diverge sharply in skills and habits.
- Watch next: Track organizational studies on defect rates, review time, and onboarding when LLM-generated code and prose are systematically constrained.
