### TL;DR
Developer Raphael Amorim explains why he paused his experimental Rust editor Boo and isn’t open-sourcing it: it’s a personal Lego-like playground meant to delight only him, not a product, business, or community project. When side projects start feeling repetitive or commercialized, he loses the spark needed to craft memorable “wow” software, like Breath of the Wild. Boo will wait while he joyfully builds his own language—even if no one else ever cares.

### Comment pulse
- Personal tools as private playgrounds → Resisting pressure to open‑source/SaaS preserves weirdness; small, self‑hosted software feels countercultural — counterpoint: some still favor publishing read‑only source.  
- Make it for yourself → Commenters liken this to art made without audience in mind; democratized patronage became click‑driven, diluting soul‑driven projects and authentic self‑expression.  
- User impact and repetition → Jokes about software inspiring rage and family neglect; others note repetitive work can still wow, e.g., yt‑dlp’s site support.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat hobby tools as art projects; optimize for personal wonder, not users, revenue, or contributor-friendliness.  
- Impact: Encourages developers burned out on product thinking to pursue narrow, idiosyncratic tools that may later influence mainstream software.  
- Watch next: More solo editors, shells, languages built quietly for years, then selectively shared once they’re stable or feel ‘complete’.
