# Craft software that makes people feel something

### TL;DR
HN readers riff on the idea of “software that makes people feel something” as closer to art than product: the best tools often start as intensely personal playgrounds, built without expectations of users, fame, or monetization. People contrast this with today’s pressure to open-source, SaaS-ify, or go “enterprise-scale,” which can kill experimentation and weirdness. Examples like Emacs, Emacspeak, and yt-dlp show how depth, breadth, and clear, honest interfaces can evoke delight—or, in some cases, sheer rage.

### Comment pulse
- Make it for yourself → Authentic, non-appeasing work carries real personality and insight, even if recognition comes late or never.  
- Modern patronage is clicks → Creators feel forced to optimize for engagement, not expression—counterpoint: solo “for-me” projects still occasionally break out and influence mainstream tools.  
- Emotional software spans joy to fury → Emacs/Emacspeak and quirky editors feel like playful labs, while corporate tools like Teams evoke strong negative feelings but still “matter” to users.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat some projects as private labs; resist early productization pressure to preserve risk-taking and emotional texture.  
- Impact: Individual devs gain creative fulfillment; users later benefit from more idiosyncratic, powerful tools escaping the lab.  
- Watch next: Funding and distribution models that support “weird” tools—small grants, patronage, or niche marketplaces—without demanding enterprise growth.
