- Score: 239 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46235412) | Link: https://libroot.org/posts/going-through-snowden-documents-part-1/

### TL;DR
An open-source project is systematically re-examining under-analyzed Snowden leaks. This first post dissects a 2009 XKEYSCORE training slide deck, uncovering concrete NSA hacking operations: deep compromise of Chinese defense giant Norinco, Mexican federal police systems, and an Iranian customs/rail laptop. It documents implants logging pre-encryption web traffic, Windows registry usage, multilingual keystrokes, and VPN-related terms, plus new codenames. Hacker News debates Snowden’s legacy, surveillance normalization, modest policy response, and whether the disclosures truly changed public behavior.

### Comment pulse
- Many praise Snowden and this deep-dive, contrasting 2013 enthusiasm with today’s HN comments they see as more pro-government and corporate.  
- Skeptics call the leaks overhyped or tainted by his Russian exile, arguing they mostly confirmed suspicions and focused on non-American targets.  
- Policy-minded users highlight the failed 2020 Wyden–Daines warrant requirement and expanding surveillance—counterpoint: others stress bulk collection isn’t equivalent to individualized spying on everyone.

### LLM perspective
- View: Re-mining low-profile Snowden docs can surface concrete operations, useful for historians, policymakers, and threat modelers beyond initial sensational programs.  
- Impact: Confirms state-level CNE against commercial orgs and allies, reinforcing need for ubiquitous encryption, endpoint hardening, and realistic assumptions about compromise.  
- Watch next: Track Libroot’s later parts, cross-reference unreleased codenames with leaks, and compare with post-2009 tooling revealed in Vault 7/Equation Group dumps.
