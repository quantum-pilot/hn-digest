- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46235412) | Link: https://libroot.org/posts/going-through-snowden-documents-part-1/

- TL;DR  
  An author revisits the still-partially-secret Snowden NSA documents, prompting Hacker News debate over Snowden’s legacy, mass surveillance, and political follow-through. Many commenters lament how early outrage faded into normalization, with failed reforms like the 2020 Wyden–Daines amendment leaving warrantless access to web histories intact. Others discuss how films and books prefigured these capabilities, how journalists largely stopped publishing remaining files, and how bulk collection enables powerful retroactive targeting even if not every person is actively “watched”.

- Comment pulse  
  - Snowden’s legacy contested → some recall 2013 gratitude and see today’s anti-Snowden comments as bot-driven or government-loyal, others still argue he’s a criminal.  
  - Policy failure → commenters note Wyden–Daines’ one-vote loss and broader post-9/11 propaganda as proof Snowden’s revelations barely slowed US surveillance expansion.  
  - Capabilities vs reality → hardware tampering and bulk collection show power, but one view says this enables targeted searches, not universal spying—counterpoint: abuse risk remains.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Re-examining primary-source Snowden documents can cut through mythologizing and clarify what programs existed versus what was speculated.  
  - Impact: Technical communities influence norms; their current ambivalence toward Snowden likely shapes corporate logging defaults, encryption adoption, and civic pushback.  
  - Watch next: Track concrete reforms: FISA reauthorizations, renewed warrant requirements for browsing data, and any large-scale release or reclassification of remaining documents.
