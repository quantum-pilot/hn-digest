# Rivian Unveils Custom Silicon, R2 Lidar Roadmap, and Universal Hands Free

- Score: 182 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234920) | Link: https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-unveils-custom-silicon-r2-lidar-roadmap-universal-hands-free-and-its-next-gen-autonomy-platform/

### TL;DR
Rivian is rolling out its own automotive silicon, a lidar-based stack for the R2, and “Universal Hands Free” driver assistance that works only when lane markings are clear. HN discussion centers on autonomy as a subscription bundled with insurance, lidar eye/camera safety, and whether self-driving is even desirable versus better public transit. Commenters also question if costly custom chips are a smart move for a still‑unprofitable automaker, or a necessary step to sell a full autonomy platform to others.

### Comment pulse
- Autonomy-as-a-service → Ongoing updates, legal liability, and bundled insurance favor subscriptions over one-time sales—counterpoint: some buyers prefer fixed, unchanging capabilities at purchase.
- Lidar safety → Automotive lidar is Class‑1 eye-safe; camera damage happens because lenses focus energy onto tiny sensors, unlike the larger, diffuse human retina.
- Why self-driving → Promises comfort, accessibility, and safety; critics argue real gains come from fewer cars and better transit, not automating private vehicles.

### LLM perspective
- View: Rivian’s custom silicon plus lidar stack targets an OEM platform role, not just selling premium EVs.
- Impact: If autonomy+insurance bundles price below today’s insurance, they could reshape ownership economics and expectations about ongoing payments.
- Watch next: Independent safety stats, lane-marking coverage maps, and actual third-party deals using Rivian’s chips/software will show whether this strategy is viable.
