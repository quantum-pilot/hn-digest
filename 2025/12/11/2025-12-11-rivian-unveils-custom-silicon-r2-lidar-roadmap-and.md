# Rivian Unveils Custom Silicon, R2 Lidar Roadmap, and Universal Hands Free

- Score: 391 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234920) | Link: https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-unveils-custom-silicon-r2-lidar-roadmap-universal-hands-free-and-its-next-gen-autonomy-platform/

### TL;DR
Rivian’s Autonomy and AI Day introduced RAP1, a 5 nm in‑house autonomy chip (1,600 sparse INT8 TOPS) powering its Gen 3 Autonomy Compute Module. Gen 3 debuts on the R2 in late 2026; lidar will be added later to complement cameras and radar. Current Gen 2 R1T/R1S owners get “Universal Hands Free” lane‑keeping over 3.5M miles of mapped roads. A paid Autonomy+ tier, priced at $2,500 or $49.99/month, a unified data platform, and an on‑device Rivian Assistant LLM round out the push toward Level‑4‑capable hardware.

### Comment pulse
- Autonomy as subscription → Seen as inevitable to fund training, ops, liability; some expect insurance bundles, others want fixed features—counterpoint: Chinese EVs already include ADAS.  
- Infotainment control → No CarPlay is a deal‑breaker for many; others prefer tight native integration despite fears of future laggy, locked‑in systems.  
- Vertical autonomy + lidar → Many favor in‑house stacks and multi‑sensor safety, noting automotive lidar is eye‑safe for humans but can still damage cameras.

### LLM perspective
- View: Rivian is copying Tesla’s vertical model but with heavier emphasis on lidar, custom silicon, and on‑device assistant models.  
- Impact: Buyers gain stronger ADAS and voice control, but face hardware churn and trade‑offs around subscriptions, resale value, and privacy.  
- Watch next: Whether Universal Hands Free performs reliably, how often Autonomy+ improves, and if Rivian ultimately bundles autonomy with insurance.
