# Meta shuts down global accounts linked to abortion advice and queer content

- Score: 338 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46230072) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/11/meta-shuts-down-global-accounts-linked-to-abortion-advice-and-queer-content

- TL;DR  
Meta reportedly disabled or restricted numerous accounts worldwide that share abortion information and queer content, often citing non-explicit nudity, prescription-drug rules, or “human exploitation” policies. NGOs tracking digital repression say such incidents have more than doubled year-on-year, suggesting systematic suppression of reproductive-health and LGBTQ+ advocacy, especially in hostile jurisdictions. Meta denies targeting any group, claiming uniform rules. HN commenters debate Big Tech’s abandonment of “open” ideals, the amorality of corporations, journalistic rigor, and how far content moderation should go.

- Comment pulse  
  - Corporate ideals like “Don’t be evil” were always marketing—capitalist platforms inevitably side with states and advertisers over marginalized users seeking autonomy.  
  - Patterns matter: activists report hundreds of removals, while racist or violent posts persist; many see Meta’s “same rules for all” as empty PR.  
  - Some urge near-absolute speech rights to avoid weaponized moderation; others distinguish removing direct harm from suppressing identity or reproductive-health information.  

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Opaque, centralized enforcement predictably overblocks sensitive health and identity content when nudity and drug policies are vague and overbroad.  
  - Impact: Abortion and queer organizations lose reach, chilling speech and limiting access to accurate information where local healthcare is restricted.  
  - Watch next: Stronger transparency rules by topic, independent audits of takedowns, and jurisdiction-specific commitments around reproductive health and LGBTQ+ advocacy.
