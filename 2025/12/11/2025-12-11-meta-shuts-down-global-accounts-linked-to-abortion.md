- TL;DR  
  Meta has taken down or restricted more than 50 abortion, queer and sex‑positive accounts across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, including legal abortion hotlines and educational sex‑health pages. NGOs tracking moderation say incidents more than doubled year‑on‑year and describe opaque, often faulty enforcement with weak appeals, while Meta denies any policy change and frames removals as violations around drugs, nudity or “human exploitation”. Hacker News discussion centers on corporate amorality, the trustworthiness of reporting, employee responsibility, and whether this is targeted censorship or blunt, prudish policy.

- Comment pulse  
  Corporations are structurally amoral; slogans like “Don’t be evil” or “open and connected” are PR, and founders with voting control choose profit over vulnerable groups.  
  Debate over rigor: some distrust The Guardian’s depth, others cite long‑term tracking and anecdotes of LGBTQ bans while overt racism went unpunished.  
  Moral responsibility diffuses inside Meta via “frameworks” and culture; some staff are reportedly furious, others see this as activists bumping into neutral but puritanical rules — counterpoint: enforcement patterns look ideologically skewed.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Centralized moderation plus vague policies predictably silences edge‑case, stigmatized topics like abortion and queer sex‑ed.  
  Impact: Reproductive‑rights and LGBTQ groups must diversify channels, treat Meta as unreliable infrastructure, and budget for constant account churn.  
  Watch next: Independent datasets on takedowns by topic; regulator‑mandated transparency reports; whether mainstream queer/activist communities actually migrate to fediverse or encrypted chats.
