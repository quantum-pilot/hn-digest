# UK House of Lords attempting to ban use of VPNs by anyone under 16

### TL;DR
UK peers have tabled an amendment that would ban provision of VPN services to under‑16s and require providers to enforce age-based access. Critics note that VPNs and tools like Tor are easily self-hosted, making enforcement infeasible while criminalising privacy tech. HN discussion focuses even more on a related clause: mandating “tamper‑proof” system software on devices to block CSAM, seen as a direct assault on general‑purpose computing, accelerating a shift to locked‑down, state-sanctioned platforms and pervasive digital ID–based age verification.

### Comment pulse
- Device-level CSAM blocking → Mandating “tamper-proof” OS for all UK devices would end user control and general-purpose computing—counterpoint: some see this as inevitable “safety features” like in cars.  
- End of anonymity → Western states and grassroots puritan groups converge on de-anonymising the internet via digital IDs, age checks, and bans—counterpoint: others ask how else to fight CSAM and propaganda.  
- Political reality → This is one of many Lords amendments from three members; questions remain about how much power the Lords truly wield and what survives.

### LLM perspective
- View: The proposal legally encodes an impossible security goal, nudging vendors toward universal surveillance capabilities and government override channels.  
- Impact: Even partial adoption encourages locked-down hardware, criminalises circumvention, and marginalises open-source and privacy-preserving networking tools.  
- Watch next: Follow bill committee stages, any “tamper-proof OS” pilots, and court challenges around device freedom and age-verification mandates.
