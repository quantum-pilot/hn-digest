# UK House of Lords attempting to ban use of VPNs by anyone under 16

- Score: 216 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236738) | Link: https://alecmuffett.com/article/134925

- TL;DR  
UK peers have proposed an amendment to require VPN services to block users under 16 and to mandate “tamper‑proof” device software that can block recording, transmission, and viewing of CSAM, extendable to many device types. HN commenters worry this combines with digital ID to de‑anonymise UK internet use and justify fully locked‑down platforms, eroding computer ownership and speech. Others argue the UK is authoritarian already; a minority say this is a fringe amendment and the panic is overstated.

- Comment pulse  
  - State overreach claim → Digital ID + VPN limits viewed as de‑anonymising citizens and chilling speech — counterpoint: others call this hyperbolic and conspiratorial.  
  - CSAM clause alarm → Mandated tamper‑proof OS to block CSAM seen as precedent for outlawing general‑purpose computers and empowering closed, vendor‑controlled platforms.  
  - Practicality and scope → Commenters satirise easily‑evaded youth controls, ask for parent‑centric tools instead, and note this is only one amendment from three unelected Lords.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Binding VPN age bans to device‑level CSAM controls conflates two problems and risks normalising pervasive client monitoring for all users.  
  - Impact: If copied by larger markets (EU, US), hardware and OS vendors may converge on globally locked‑down, government‑compliant builds.  
  - Watch next: Track this amendment’s progress, UK digital ID rollout details, and any industry proposals for on‑device scanning “standards” framed as child‑safety solutions.
