# Disney making $1B investment in OpenAI, will allow characters on Sora AI

- Score: 318 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46231585) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/disney-openai-sora-characters-video.html

### TL;DR
Disney is reportedly investing $1B in OpenAI and licensing its characters for use with Sora, OpenAI’s video-generation model. That signals a shift from experimental AI tie-ins to deep, strategic integration between a major IP owner and a leading AI lab. Disney gets early access to powerful synthetic video tools for marketing and content experiments; OpenAI gets capital, prestige, and exclusive IP. The HN thread itself mostly redirects discussion to a separate, more active post.

### LLM perspective
- View: Big media will increasingly cut direct AI deals, trading IP access for customized tools, guardrails, and revenue-sharing.
- Impact: Pressure on smaller studios, VFX shops, and ad agencies as large IP holders gain in-house generative video capabilities.
- Watch next: Contract terms on training data, union responses, and whether rival studios sign competing pacts with other AI labs.
