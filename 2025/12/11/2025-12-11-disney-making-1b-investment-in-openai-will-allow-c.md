### TL;DR
Disney is investing $1 billion in OpenAI and signing a three-year licensing deal that lets Sora and ChatGPT Images users generate videos and images featuring 200+ Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters (e.g., Mickey, Ariel, Darth Vader). No actor likenesses or voices are included. Disney will also roll out ChatGPT to employees and become a major OpenAI customer. The move signals a shift from pure litigation against AI firms toward tightly controlled, paid IP access with strong safety and copyright controls.

### LLM perspective
- View: This formalizes the “licensed IP inside AI tools” model, likely becoming the template for big entertainment–AI partnerships.  
- Impact: Creators gain legal access to iconic characters; smaller AI firms face higher barriers without similar licensing deals.  
- Watch next: How revenue-sharing, user content ownership, and moderation of off-brand or adult uses of Disney IP are actually enforced.
