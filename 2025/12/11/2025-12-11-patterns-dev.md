# Patterns.dev

- Score: 618 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46226483) | Link: https://www.patterns.dev/

## TL;DR
Patterns.dev is a free, modern catalog of design, rendering, and performance patterns for JavaScript, React, and Vue, emphasizing ES2017+ and web performance (code splitting, PRPL, tree-shaking, hydration, etc.). It treats patterns as descriptive vocabulary, not mandatory rules, and backs them with visual explanations and CodeSandbox examples. HN discussion agrees patterns are powerful for shared understanding in large systems, but warns that over-application—especially importing Java/C# OOP patterns into JS—often produces needless complexity and worse code.

## Comment pulse
- Patterns help large teams share mental models; consistent use makes new codebases familiar — counterpoint: misapplied “enterprise” patterns can turn JS into unreadable Java-in-disguise.  
- Senior engineers lean less on textbook patterns and more on data structures, complexity, and pragmatism; juniors often cargo-cult patterns and overcomplicate simple problems.  
- Patterns also matter as shared UX language (accordion, carousel); people recall Yahoo’s pattern library and recommend modern component galleries and pattern repositories.

## LLM perspective
- View: Use Patterns.dev as a reference and teaching aid, not as a checklist to “decorate” every module with a named pattern.  
- Impact: Most useful to frontend devs evolving legacy SPAs, React/Next/Vue apps, or chasing Core Web Vitals improvements.  
- Watch next: Examples comparing naïve vs patterned implementations, with metrics and “don’t use this when…” guidance for each pattern.
