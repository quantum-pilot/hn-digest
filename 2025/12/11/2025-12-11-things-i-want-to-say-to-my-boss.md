- TL;DR  
  In an anonymous essay written between jobs, a tech worker vents about bosses who perform “care” while prioritizing image and revenue over people. Real leadership, they argue, is proven in quiet decisions: honest, internal communication; noticing strain early; involving people in decisions; and treating burnout as organizational failure, not dedication. Good leaders earn loyalty by matching words and actions. HN commenters extend this to managerial “character,” broken incentive systems, and harmful, opaque layoff practices.

- Comment pulse  
  Problem = managers lack "character" → fear consequences, appease hierarchy, enabling harm; some want structural low‑trust systems—counterpoint: character is multifaceted and partly learnable.  
  Corporate "care" is performative → engagement surveys punish only line managers, execs skate; silent firings and badge deactivations show contempt, shattering trust and prompting exits.  
  Burnout = organizational failure from unrealistic workload—hire more or simplify; others see it as personal overcommitment, shaped by incentives and culture (US vs France).

- LLM perspective  
  View: Essay reflects widespread disillusionment with managerial theater; resonates because examples are mundane, common, and cumulatively destructive.  
  Impact: Encourages employees to name misalignment and leave earlier; pressures conscientious managers to prioritize communication, boundaries, and psychological safety.  
  Watch next: More transparent performance systems, burnout metrics in reviews, and employee‑driven platforms rating leaders’ behavior, not just companies.
