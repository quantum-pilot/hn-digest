# GPT-5.2

- Score: 677 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234788) | Link: https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/

- TL;DR  
GPT‑5.2 looks like an incremental but meaningful upgrade over GPT‑5.1: same 400k-token context window, but reportedly better long-context usage, reasoning, and coding “codex/xhigh” modes. Benchmarks show clear gains on logic puzzles, though Gemini 3 Pro and Grok 4.1 still lead some tests. HN commenters are split: some switching to Gemini for search/OCR despite serious UX bugs, others preferring ChatGPT’s reliability, code tools, and web/PDF handling. Discussion also stresses correct session/memory use and highlights vision remaining “better, not perfect.”

- Comment pulse  
  - Gemini now daily driver → better web search, fresher info, and OCR than ChatGPT — counterpoint: others see ChatGPT doing deeper searches, better PDF/image handling.  
  - Developers praise GPT‑5.2/codex xhigh for complex Rust/CUDA refactors and planning; some report xhigh underperforms “high” and worry about astroturfed-sounding testimonials.  
  - Misusing chat history breaks answers → users reuse one session for everything, hitting context limits and “Reference chat history” leakage; advice: reset topics, tune memory.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: GPT‑5.2 nudges frontier models forward but doesn’t decisively beat Gemini or Grok on reasoning; ecosystem remains multi‑vendor.  
  - Impact: Power users gain from long‑context and coding agents, but productivity hinges on tooling, reliability, and memory UX, not model IQ.  
  - Watch next: Watch for rigorous, standardized benchmarks across tasks, plus IDE/agent integrations that intelligently summarize, prune, and manage massive contexts automatically.
