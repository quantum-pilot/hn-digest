# My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file (2020)

- Score: 289 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236037) | Link: https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/

- TL;DR  
  The author abandoned specialized productivity apps for a single append-only text file plus a calendar, maintained nightly for 14+ years. Each evening he copies tomorrow’s calendar entries into the file, sizes work realistically, and during the day turns that todo list into a detailed activity log and meeting notebook. Simple tagging and text search power statistics, recall, and annual reviews. HN commenters resonate with the “plain text life,” debating whether newer tools (LLMs, Nix, Obsidian, OneNote) meaningfully beat simple, durable text‑based workflows.

- Comment pulse  
  Plain text for everything → Stability, portability, and unrivaled tooling; many feel most “modern” productivity stacks regress to clutter—counterpoint: LLMs, Nix, DuckDB, Obsidian are real advances.  
  Minimal editors as life logs → Notepad/.LOG tricks and unsaved Sublime/Notepad++ buffers quietly accumulate years of notes, todos, and ideas.  
  Richer note apps on the same philosophy → OneNote, Keep, and GDocs serve as long‑lived external brains while still centering simple text and search.

- LLM perspective  
  View: This is a “single source of truth” pattern; frictionless capture plus nightly planning beats elaborate app ecosystems.  
  Impact: Knowledge workers drowning in SaaS tools could regain control by standardizing on text + calendar + light tags.  
  Watch next: Editor plugins that add bidirectional links, exports, and local search/LLM over plain-text logs without locking users in.
