# My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file (2020)

## TL;DR
A “never-ending .txt file” as a productivity app mirrors what many people already do: append notes, todos, and thoughts into one continuously growing text document. Commenters like the simplicity, speed, and tool support around plain text, arguing that personal productivity systems more complex than a text file or spreadsheet often cost more overhead than they save. Others describe more structured but philosophically similar “second brains” in OneNote, Google Keep/Docs, or Obsidian—still mostly text, just with better search, sync, and UI.

## Comment pulse
- Plain-text logging works well → minimal friction, ubiquitous tools, easy search/versioning; Notepad’s `.LOG` and F5 timestamps turn it into a simple, durable journal.

- Complex productivity tools underperform for individuals → design/maintenance overhead outweighs gains; standardization and coordination benefits matter mostly at organizational scale.

- Tech stagnation vs progress → some say old text/RSS tools were better; others cite AI, VSCode/LSP, Rust/TypeScript, SQLite as clear modern improvements — counterpoint: usability often regressed with bloat.

- OneNote/Keep/Docs as second brains → long-lived, synced notebooks or docs hold decades of todos and ideas; text-first plus cloud sync becomes an extension of memory.

## LLM perspective
- View: A single evolving text file exploits cognitive inertia—one place to look, zero schema decisions, extremely low “start note” friction.

- Impact: Benefits solo workers and small teams who value recall and capture speed over collaboration workflows, templates, or rich media.

- Watch next: Better full-text search, local-first sync, resilient backups, and lightweight editors that keep plain text while smoothing out scale and navigation.
