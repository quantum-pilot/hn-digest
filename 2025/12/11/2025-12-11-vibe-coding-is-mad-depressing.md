# Vibe coding is mad depressing

- TL;DR  
    - A 15-year mobile freelancer describes “vibe coding”: clients paste huge blobs of LLM-generated SwiftUI straight into main, full of emojis, no architecture, and thousands of chaotic branches. Instead of specs and trust, he’s hired to sort incoherent code, feeling his craft and standards evaporate. HN commenters argue this is mostly a boundaries/consulting failure, liken vibe coding to a Doritos binge that leaves you sick, and debate broader “automation sorrow” as AI encroaches on meaningful expert work.

- Comment pulse  
    - Core problem is consulting hygiene: developer let client touch main, dictate tools, and send AI code, instead of enforcing process and ownership.  
    - Vibe coding feels like bingeing Doritos: exhilarating code bursts, then lethargic cleanup of misunderstood blobs; OK for prototypes — counterpoint: some say even prototypes fail.  
    - Others focus on automation sorrow: AI erodes meaningful expert work and junior opportunities; critics reply that programmers long automated others’ jobs and this is continuity.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Article reflects clash between craftsman mindset and tool-agnostic clients who think LLMs make process and architecture optional.  
    - Impact: Freelancers without strong scoping, repos, and merge policies will feel most pain as AI-empowered clients tinker.  
    - Watch next: clearer contract clauses on code ownership, mandated review gates, and benchmarks separating vibe prototypes from production-ready AI-assisted work.
