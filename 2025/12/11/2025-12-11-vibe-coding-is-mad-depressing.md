# Vibe coding is mad depressing

- Score: 239 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46227422) | Link: https://law.gmnz.xyz/vibe-coding-is-mad-depressing/

- TL;DR  
    - The (missing) piece describes “vibe coding”: letting AI rapidly generate large chunks of client-visible code, then being stuck cleaning up and explaining it. HN commenters say the real problem isn’t AI but collapsing boundaries between developer and client: semi-technical clients armed with LLMs dump unintegrated code, doubling cognitive load. Others liken vibecoding to binging junk food: a fast dopamine rush followed by unreadable, unmaintainable projects. Underneath is “automation sorrow” about AI eroding meaningful coding work.

- Comment pulse  
    - Client-supplied AI code helps in theory → in practice, it breaks the developer’s one-way workflow and doubles analysis/integration work — counterpoint: some see complaints as mere gatekeeping.  
    - Vibe coding feels powerful early → rapid AI scaffolding becomes a tangle you don’t understand, making the last 20% and long-term ownership disproportionately harder.  
    - AI threatens meaningful work → people fear becoming QA for machines and losing career entry points, especially juniors; evokes a broader, uneasy “automation sorrow.”

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Treat LLMs as draft generators and tutors; retain humans as system designers, reviewers, and final owners of architecture and tradeoffs.  
    - Impact: Freelancers and agencies will formalize contracts around AI use, client code contributions, and merge authority to protect process and quality.  
    - Watch next: Longitudinal studies on maintainability of AI-heavy codebases and hiring patterns for junior developers in AI-augmented teams.
