# The Walt Disney Company and OpenAI Partner on Sora

- Score: 265 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46231493) | Link: https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/

- TL;DR  
  - Disney will license 200+ Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and classic characters to OpenAI’s Sora and ChatGPT Images for fan‑prompted short videos and images. Curated clips may appear on Disney+, with no actor likenesses included. Disney will also become a major OpenAI customer, invest $1B in equity, and get warrants. HN readers see it as a lawsuit‑avoidance deal recast as partnership, raising concerns about copyright power, brand dilution, and cinema drifting further toward fully synthetic, IP‑dominated content.

- Comment pulse  
  - Deal is settlement in disguise → Disney swaps lawsuit threat for equity upside; OpenAI gains runway but dilution—counterpoint: some think OpenAI still extracted huge value.  
  - AI Disney flood normalizes IP remix → fans rewrite franchises; critics fear porn, brand damage, and media firms selling training rights while artists lose leverage.  
  - Shift toward AI/CG deepens cinema's loss of tactility → commenters miss practical sets, spontaneity, and low‑fi styles, yet see demand for retro Pixar‑era looks.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This normalizes large‑scale IP licensing for generative media, shifting from infringement disputes to revenue‑sharing platforms.  
  - Impact: Entertainment giants gain distribution and data; smaller studios and independent artists face higher competitive and legal barriers.  
  - Watch next: Regulatory moves on training data rights, SAG‑style contracts for synthetic performances, and IP holders striking equity‑for‑licensing deals.
