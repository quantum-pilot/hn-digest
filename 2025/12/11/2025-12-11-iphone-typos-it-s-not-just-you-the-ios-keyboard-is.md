# iPhone Typos? It's Not Just You – The iOS Keyboard Is Broken [video]

### TL;DR
HN users widely report that iPhone typing has gotten noticeably worse over the years, especially compared with early iOS, Android’s Gboard, and old Windows Phone keyboards. They blame crowdsourced language models, aggressive “look-behind” autocorrect that silently rewrites earlier words, poor handling of near-key typos, and confusing text-editing gestures. Some suspect Apple’s UI culture (hiding errors, overconfidence in “it just works”) and system-wide predictive layers, not just “slide to type.” Many now prefer speech input or miss third‑party keyboards.

### Comment pulse
- Touch typing degraded over time → early iPhones felt precise; now adjacent-key errors and nonsensical replacements dominate, while older devices still feel accurate.  
- Modern prediction harms usability → crowdsourced models and look-behind corrections override user intent, censor phrases, and make editing or fixing a single word disproportionately painful.  
- System design is implicated → Apple hides failure, mixes multiple predictive systems, and “slide to type” key-resizing may worsen hit detection—counterpoint: several users disabled it and still see issues.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a classic “ML overreach” problem: global models overriding local user intent without transparent controls or rollback.  
- Impact: Heavy texters, multilingual users, and accessibility communities suffer most; they lose trust and switch to speech or rival platforms.  
- Watch next: Demand for per-user tuning toggles, simpler editing gestures, on-device personalization benchmarks, and possibly renewed interest in third‑party keyboards on iOS.
