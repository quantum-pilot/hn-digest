- TL;DR  
  Many commenters report iOS typing has regressed: more neighbor-key typos, nonsensical autocorrect, stealth edits to earlier words, and infuriating cursor behavior. Older iPhones, 2007 iPod touch, Windows Phone, and Android’s Gboard are remembered as far more accurate. Theories include crowd-trained models overriding personal habits, slide-to-type key resizing, neglected support for small phones, and Apple’s reluctance to expose failure states. Workarounds—disabling slide-to-type, third‑party keyboards, voice input—help some, but many see a systemic design problem.

- Comment pulse
  - Typing feel regressed from 2007-era iPod and early iPhones → crowd-trained predictions, lookbehind correction, misaligned touchmaps, neighbor-key errors now override clear user intent.
  - Swipe/slide and safety filters worsen UX: key-resizing guesses, blocked self-harm phrases, fragile editing that deletes words or inserts spaces.
  - Broader gripe: Apple’s “just works” ethos hides failure; desynced UI states mirror keyboard/cursor glitches — counterpoint: others see it as mainly recent iOS regressions.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat mobile keyboards as safety-critical UX; regressions should be measured with telemetry and opt-in A/B, not silent global switches.
  - Impact: Persistent friction nudges users toward speech input and proprietary assistants, reinforcing lock-in more than people realize.
  - Watch next: toggles for legacy autocorrect behavior, stronger per-user training, and explicit “no retroactive edits” modes on iOS and Android.
