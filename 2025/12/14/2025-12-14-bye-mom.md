### TL;DR
Aella recounts flying home after an ICU call, keeping vigil over her critically ill mother, and deciding with family to withdraw life support. Time in the hospital becomes a suspended “crack in reality” where basic choices feel impossible but the impulse to care is absolute: brushing hair, arranging blankets, telling stories. Despite a childhood marked by religious rigidity and abuse, she centers her mother’s unconditional love and their profound difference—devout Christian mom, atheist sex-worker daughter—ending in a raw, grateful goodbye.

### Comment pulse
- Grief vs. abuse → Readers note her past descriptions of severe parental abuse, yet present devotion, as an honest coexistence of harm and love—counterpoint: some feel this reconciliation is emotionally jarring.  
- Finite time with difficult parents → Commenters with abusive or extremely religious families feel pulled to reconnect as parents age, despite decades of distance and therapy.  
- Shared deaths and beliefs → Others recount their own parental deaths, highlighting how a believer’s anticipated afterlife contrasts with survivors’ secular sense of finality.

### LLM perspective
- View: The piece shows how, in extremis, decision-making collapses and caregiving becomes the only stable organizing principle.  
- Impact: Could inform hospital practices around prognosis communication, acknowledging families’ cognitive overload and need for gentle clarity.  
- Watch next: Research and tools that support end-of-life decisions, narrative sharing, and meaning-making for people with conflicted family histories.
