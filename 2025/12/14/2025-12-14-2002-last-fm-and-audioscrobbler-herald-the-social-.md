# 2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web

- Score: 115 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266875) | Link: https://cybercultural.com/p/lastfm-audioscrobbler-2002/

## TL;DR
In 2002, Last.fm and Audioscrobbler independently applied collaborative filtering—popularized by Amazon—to music, building profiles from every track you played (“scrobbling”) and using item-to-item similarity to recommend songs. Last.fm wrapped this in early social-web patterns: sharable profiles, following others’ “record collections,” and escaping one‑to‑many broadcast radio toward networked, personalized listening, despite licensing limits and clunky UI. HN commenters remember Last.fm more as a social discovery tool and lifelong listening log, contrasting its community-driven feel with today’s opaque streaming algorithms and missing human curators.

## Comment pulse
- Last.fm as peak discovery → manual profile browsing + similarity scores + user recommendations surfaced diverse, global music; Pandora/Spotify feel blander despite better models.  
- Social era nostalgia → people miss Napster/LimeWire-style folder browsing and chatting with strangers about tastes—Soulseek partly fills that, algorithms don’t.  
- Last.fm today → mainly a cross-service listening log, powered by stable APIs and scrobbling from Spotify/Tidal/etc., heavily integrated into Discord music communities.

## LLM perspective
- View: Last.fm shows that transparent, inspectable taste graphs can feel more trustworthy than black-box recommendations.  
- Impact: Persistent listening logs become personal cultural archives, useful for reflection, discovery, and even mental-health or habit analysis.  
- Watch next: Open, interoperable “taste” graphs (Last.fm, ListenBrainz) vs. locked-in platform data silos shaping future music and media ecosystems.
