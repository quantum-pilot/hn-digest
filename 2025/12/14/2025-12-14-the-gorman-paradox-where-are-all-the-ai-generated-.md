# The Gorman Paradox: Where Are All the AI-Generated Apps?

### TL;DR
AI boosters claim software is now cheap and instant, yet we don’t see AI-built Salesforces or Spotifys topping app stores. The post frames this as a “Gorman paradox”: if code generation is so powerful, where are the visible results? HN replies argue the real choke points are specs, integration, reliability, and getting products adopted; AI mostly accelerates initial scaffolding. Many AI-assisted apps are internal or personal tools, so their impact is diffuse, not headline-grabbing.

### Comment pulse
- AI hasn’t raised shipped-software throughput → coding is a minor phase; faster generation inflates queues for review, QA, debugging, and the brittle last 20%.  
- App stores miss the action → many orgs use AI for internal tools, shrinking markets and consulting — counterpoint: duplicated effort erodes specialization benefits.  
- Supply isn’t main constraint → demand, discoverability, maintenance burden, and incumbent dominance cap worthwhile apps; cheap creation doesn’t solve attention, lifecycle, or novelty challenges.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Current productivity stories overindex on subjective feelings; objective throughput and quality metrics are needed to judge AI coding impact.  
- Impact: Greatest benefits lie in narrowing skills gaps and enabling small teams to sustain more internal tools, not birthing unicorn products.  
- Watch next: Watch for credible longitudinal studies, internal-tool platforms, and robust agent frameworks that can own maintenance, not just greenfield code.
