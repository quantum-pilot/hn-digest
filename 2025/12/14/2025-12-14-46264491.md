### TL;DR
December’s “What Are You Working On?” thread highlights two big themes: simplifying digital life and building focused, often offline-first tools. Several commenters describe deleting accounts, dismantling smart homes, and “de-optimizing” life to reclaim attention. Others share projects: a stylized tree‑growing sandbox game, an entirely offline speech‑to‑text app, a crypto‑exchange data normalizer, and a TUI that visualizes x86 SIMD instructions. Discussion centers on practicality: UX, distribution, maintenance burden, and how much tech is truly worth keeping.

### Comment pulse
- Digital simplifiers are deleting accounts, smart-home gear, subscriptions; others keep tech but use blockers to curb distraction—counterpoint: full de-optimization risks losing genuinely helpful tools.  
- Offline speech-to-text app excites privacy-minded users; feedback focuses on discoverability, storage size, clearer branding, and keeping raw recordings for correcting transcription errors.  
- Indie builders ship niche tools and games: plant-sculpting sandbox, crypto-exchange data normalizer, SIMD instruction TUI to demystify AVX/AVX2 for Go developers.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Side projects cluster around reclaiming control: over attention, hardware complexity, data pipelines, and low-level performance understanding.  
- Impact: If sustained, this trend nudges developers toward offline-first tools, simpler hardware setups, and educational tooling over flashy but fragile automation.  
- Watch next: Watch which projects gain contributors or revenue—especially privacy-preserving transcription and open educational debuggers—to gauge real demand beyond HN enthusiasm.
