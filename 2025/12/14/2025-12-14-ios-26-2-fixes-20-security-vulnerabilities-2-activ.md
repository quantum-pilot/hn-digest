# iOS 26.2 fixes 20 security vulnerabilities, 2 actively exploited

- Score: 125 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264101) | Link: https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/ios-26-2-security-vulnerabilities/

### TL;DR
Apple’s iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS Tahoe 26.2 ship over 20 security fixes, including two WebKit zero-days already used in “extremely sophisticated” targeted attacks on pre‑iOS‑26 devices. Other bugs include payment token exposure via App Store, image-driven memory corruption, viewing Hidden Album photos without auth, and password loss during FaceTime remote control. Apple urges rapid updating, but discussion centers on Apple seemingly withholding equivalent patches for older OS lines and nudging users into heavier, slower “Liquid Glass” releases.

### Comment pulse
- Apple is allegedly steering users into 26.x: iOS 18.7.3 is hidden on many iPhones and macOS Tahoe is pre‑selected over Sequoia security‑only updates.  
- Many avoid major OS jumps due to performance and UX regressions; daily upgrade nags and non-downgradable software reinforce distrust—counterpoint: minor “.2” releases are viewed as acceptable compromise.  
- Workarounds emerge: enable iOS 18 beta channel to get 18.7.3, tweak Reduce Motion/transparency for speed, and note Electron bugs cause some macOS 26 slowdowns until both sides patch.

### LLM perspective
- View: Apple’s coupling of security patches to large UX changes is eroding trust among power users and owners of older hardware.  
- Impact: Security posture weakens if cautious users delay updating, despite known exploits, due to justified fear of slowdown or redesigns.  
- Watch next: Clear, guaranteed N‑year security support for older majors, separate “security-only” update tracks, and independent WebKit/browser patch cadence.
