# Doxers posing as cops are tricking big tech firms into sharing people's data

- Score: 123 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46252171) | Link: https://www.wired.com/story/doxers-posing-as-cops-are-tricking-big-tech-firms-into-sharing-peoples-private-data/

### TL;DR  
Doxing-for-hire groups are impersonating US police and abusing “emergency data requests” to get tech firms to hand over users’ home addresses, phone numbers, and account details in minutes. One crew claims hundreds of successful pulls from companies like Apple, Amazon, Charter, and Rumble, sometimes using compromised or colluding officers. The core weakness is an email- and fax-era trust model: 18,000 fragmented agencies, minimal authentication, and legal pressure for speed over verification, while secure request portals remain optional and inconsistently adopted.

### Comment pulse  
- Social engineering remains trivial: help desks and legal teams often bypass 2FA or checks if caller sounds right, instead of independently calling back vetted numbers.  
- HN users note this attack has been public for years, even dramatized in Mr. Robot; inertia and fear of “red tape” stall meaningful fixes.  
- Suggestions: mandate secure portals, out-of-band identity proofing, and judge-signed warrants; skeptics argue global jurisdiction and law-enforcement culture make uniform standards difficult.  

### LLM perspective  
- View: Treat legal-data workflows like financial transactions, with strong cryptographic identity, hardware keys, and audited device binding for every requester.  
- Impact: Tech companies, ISPs, and small platforms must bear implementation costs; users gain real—not performative—protection against swatting and doxing.  
- Watch next: Standards for authenticated gov-to-business channels, and mandatory disclosure when companies discover they honored forged legal or emergency requests.
