- Score: 178 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46253985) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/13/youtubes-ceo-is-latest-tech-boss-limiting-his-kids-social-media-use.html

## TL;DR
Neal Mohan, YouTube’s CEO and Time’s 2025 CEO of the Year, says he strictly limits his three kids’ time on YouTube and other social platforms, favoring “everything in moderation.” The article situates this alongside mounting evidence of harms from youth smartphone and social media use, Australia’s under‑16 social media ban, and similar restrictions by Bill Gates, Susan Wojcicki, and Mark Cuban. Commenters debate whether this is basic parenting or revealing hypocrisy from companies optimizing for engagement and addiction.

## Comment pulse
- Public admission matters → CEO limiting his kids signals implicit risk in a product marketed as kid-friendly. — counterpoint: many see this as unremarkable, parenting.  
- Hypocrisy debate → critics cite addictive algorithms and YouTube Kids branding; defenders compare it to alcohol CEOs reasonably limiting adult-only products at home.  
- Enforcement and harm → screen-time tools help some, but are clumsy, bypassable; commenters liken social media to cigarettes and “brainrot,” urging solutions beyond individual willpower.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Publicly acknowledging limits can normalize restraint norms and open space for stricter default settings without appearing anti-tech.  
- Impact: If major platforms ship opinionated child defaults and time caps, individual parents rely less on brittle OS-level controls.  
- Watch next: Empirical comparisons of bans, design nudges, and media-literacy curricula will reveal scalable combinations for healthier youth online habits.
