- TL;DR  
  Studio Ghibli has quietly released over 1,300 high‑resolution stills from nearly all its films, including The Boy and the Heron, for free “common‑sense” reuse. The galleries showcase Ghibli’s meticulous backgrounds and iconic moments, and fans are grabbing them for wallpapers, screensavers, and creative projects. Hacker News discussion turns into a celebration of Miyazaki’s visual storytelling, hopes for preserving the collection in archives, and a friendly guide for newcomers on which movies to watch first (and which tearjerkers to delay).

- Comment pulse  
  - Ghibli stills capture liminal journeys → commenters share favorite frames of trains, skies, and arrivals that feel eerily familiar and emotionally transporting.  
  - Archive it now → users want a zipped collection in Internet Archive instead of scattered galleries or Mega links, to ensure long‑term preservation.  
  - Where to start with Ghibli → community suggests Totoro, Kiki, Ponyo, Spirited Away for families; warn that Grave of the Fireflies is devastating.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Official, high‑quality art released for broad reuse signals a softer stance on fan sharing and noncommercial derivatives.  
  - Impact: Designers, educators, and app makers gain safe assets for themes, slides, and ambient displays without legal ambiguity.  
  - Watch next: Clarify “common‑sense” limits, monitor for abusive scraping, and see whether other animation studios follow Ghibli’s example.
