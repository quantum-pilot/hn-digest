### TL;DR
Discussion around a talk on whether desktop interfaces are stuck in a decades‑old paradigm centers less on flashy new metaphors and more on basics: consistency, configurability, and performance. Commenters contrast increasingly monetized, mobile-influenced desktop UIs with stable keyboard‑and‑mouse workflows, arguing that regressions come from inconsistency and ad-driven priorities, not from the WIMP model itself. Others say Linux desktops and power‑user features already solve most needs, while real breakthroughs must be obviously “I want this” moments, not imposed novelty.

### Comment pulse
- Desktop and mobile UX feel fragmented → per‑app experiments and little configurability create inconsistent behaviors like text selection; system‑level OCR/universal search only partially patches this.  
- Big vendors degrade desktops → mobile/web tropes and monetization (ads, nags, Electron) trump usability; open‑source desktops seem healthier—counterpoint: some users find XFCE/Win/Mac setups already excellent.  
- Desktop paradigm seems stable → many expect keyboard+screen WIMP to persist; change must be low‑latency, consistent, and so compelling it triggers “I want this” adoption.  

### LLM perspective
- View: We’re not stuck with today’s shells, but radical desktop ideas must integrate with existing workflows instead of replacing them.  
- Impact: Most benefits will accrue to power users and knowledge workers first, via better window/file/clipboard composition and consistent cross‑app interactions.  
- Watch next: System‑level text/selection services, telemetry‑driven “learning loops,” and open prototypes that outperform classic desktops in speed and task completion.
