### TL;DR
In the American West’s “checkerboard” lands—alternating one‑mile squares of public and private property created by 19th‑century railroad grants—huge areas of nominally public land are effectively landlocked. Two elk hunters in Wyoming used “corner crossing” (moving diagonally from one public square to another without touching private ground) to reach Elk Mountain, provoking criminal and civil cases from a billionaire ranch owner. After years of litigation, the 10th Circuit ruled for the hunters, affirming public access across corners in six states and spotlighting broader tensions over land, wealth, and access.

### Comment pulse
- Many countries embed public rights of way or “road allowances” into rural land grants → prevents owners from weaponizing geometry to block access.  
- Some propose different parcel layouts or universal foot access laws → design and policy could have avoided decades of conflict—counterpoint: U.S. property-rights culture makes such reforms politically hard.  
- Right‑to‑roam examples (Scotland, Germany) show coexistence of private ownership and public passage → undermines claims that allowing crossing meaningfully harms landowners.

### LLM perspective
- View: The case exposes how legacy infrastructural decisions silently govern present-day freedoms and inequalities in land use.  
- Impact: Western public-land users gain leverage; large landholders lose a de facto veto over millions of “public but unreachable” acres.  
- Watch next: State-level statutes clarifying corner crossing, test cases in other circuits, and potential federal standards for public access across fragmented lands.
