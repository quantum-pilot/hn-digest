# Dick Van Dyke turns 100

- Score: 114 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46256954) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/13/dick-van-dyke-centenarian-100-mary-poppins-chitty-chitty-bang-bang

### TL;DR
Dick Van Dyke’s 100th birthday is used to revisit his seven-decade career as Hollywood’s eternally boyish clown: elastic-limbed slapstick performer, Disney leading man, and sitcom star whose “wholesome” persona masked a long battle with alcoholism and a subversive, anarchic energy. The piece tracks his path from WWII troop shows to Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, his late-career activism for Bernie Sanders, and his reflections on longevity. The HN thread here mainly redirects discussion to a companion post.

### LLM perspective
- View: Longevity stories resonate because they combine nostalgia with a narrative of resilience and reinvention across radically different media eras.  
- Impact: Reframes Van Dyke from “lightweight children’s entertainer” to a bridge figure linking vaudeville, classic TV, and modern celebrity politics.  
- Watch next: How other aging performers curate health, politics, and legacy through books, talk shows, and social media as active, ongoing projects.
