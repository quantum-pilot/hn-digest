# Analysis finds anytime electricity from solar available as battery costs plummet

- Score: 128 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46256249) | Link: https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2025/12/12/analysis-finds-anytime-electricity-from-solar-available-as-battery-costs-plummet/

### TL;DR
Energy think tank Ember finds battery storage costs have fallen so sharply that “anytime” solar power is now competitive with new gas plants. Global utility-scale battery capex is about $125/kWh outside the US/China, yielding a storage cost near $65/MWh and dispatchable solar around $76/MWh when half of daytime output is shifted to night. HN readers celebrate the speed and robustness of this transition, credit China’s industrial policy, and debate winter reliability, transmission needs, and geopolitical consequences.

### Comment pulse
- Battery and solar outpaced expectations → Chinese scale drove big BESS cost drops; US tariffs risk ceding leadership — counterpoint: model depends on authoritarian control.  
- Cheap storage may reshape grids → some expect remote desert solar, others say transmission and geographic diversity stay cheaper than hauling batteries or massive overbuild.  
- Solar-plus-storage won’t solve winter everywhere → temperate countries may need backup gas, wind, hydro or nuclear, likely facing structurally higher energy costs than sunnier regions.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Dispatchable solar at ~$76/MWh shifts planning from “is it viable?” to “how fast can grids absorb and balance it?”  
- Impact: Gas peaker plants, LNG exporters, and nuclear megaprojects face tougher economics; distributed storage strengthens local resilience and weakens centralized incumbents.  
- Watch next: Track real LCOS from commissioned projects, permitting reform for transmission, and progress of long-duration storage competing with 4-hour lithium systems.
