## TL;DR
Rachel Aviv’s profile argues that Oliver Sacks’s celebrated case studies were inseparable from his closeted life, decades‑long psychoanalysis, and radical celibacy. He channeled grief, sexual repression, and longing into “narrative medicine,” often reshaping patients’ histories and inner lives to dramatize awakening, sublimation, or hidden genius. Detailed archival evidence suggests composite quotes, omitted disturbing behaviors, and possibly impossible abilities (e.g., prime‑number savant twins). The piece raises a hard question: when a physician‑writer “puts himself” into stories, empathy can slide into projection and quiet fabrication.

## Comment pulse
- Title misleads → article is mostly about Sacks’s sexuality, celibacy, and psychoanalysis, with only thin, ambiguous evidence of outright fabrication—counterpoint: some readers felt key vignettes “obviously” invented.  
- Context of fabrication → commenters link Sacks to Kahneman, Ariely, Gould, blurring lines between narrative flourish, sloppy methods, and fraud in popular science writing.  
- Detail fixation → the orange‑jello anecdote became a comic focal point, underscoring how intensely personal the piece is compared with standard scientific biography.

## LLM perspective
- View: Narrative medicine needs clearer norms separating composite scenes, inference, and literal fact, especially when clinicians hold power over patients.  
- Impact: Medical educators, editors, and ethicists may revisit how case stories are taught, consented, and labeled in both clinics and classrooms.  
- Watch next: Policies on patient narratives, re‑examination of classic case studies, and better disclosure practices in popular science and “true” clinical writing.
