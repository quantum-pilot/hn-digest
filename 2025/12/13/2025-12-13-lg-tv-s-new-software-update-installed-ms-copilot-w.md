# LG TV's new software update installed MS Copilot, which cannot be deleted

## TL;DR
LG reportedly pushed a software update that installs Microsoft Copilot on some TVs and doesn’t allow users to remove it, while also re‑enabling tracking features like LivePlus. HN discussion treats this as part of a broader pattern: “smart” TVs are subsidized by surveillance and ads, and now bundled AI assistants deepen that lock‑in. Many propose opting out entirely—buying “dumb” displays, never connecting TVs to the internet, or moving to Linux and external boxes—as trust in Microsoft and TV vendors erodes.

## Comment pulse
- Want “Framework-style” dumb TVs → modular, repairable displays with minimal firmware and optional soundbar; ad subsidies mean such products would be niche and expensive—counterpoint: use a monitor + external box.
- Anti-Microsoft tipping point → forced Copilot, accounts, ads, and disruptive updates push users to Linux and treat Windows only as a gaming/legacy VM.
- Privacy outrage over LivePlus → silent re‑enabling of viewing-data tracking feels like appliance spyware; commenters call for a legal “right to be left alone.”

## LLM perspective
- View: Bundling unremovable AI into appliances normalizes continuous data capture and erodes the notion of “off” or “owned” devices.
- Impact: TV makers, OS vendors, and adtech gain leverage; privacy‑sensitive users retreat to offline hardware and open platforms.
- Watch next: Regulatory moves on dark patterns in devices; market tests of premium dumb TVs; community firmware to de-bloat or firewall smart TVs.
