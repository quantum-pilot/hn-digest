### TL;DR
Cambridge researchers built a year-long price index for SMS-based account verification, exposing a gray market that makes large-scale fake accounts very cheap in some countries. Prices range from a few cents in Russia and the U.S. to several dollars in Japan and Australia, shaped by SIM costs and ID rules. Spikes in Telegram and WhatsApp verification prices before elections indicate political influence demand. The tool reframes election interference as an economic infrastructure problem, prompting calls for stronger platform checks and SIM policies.

### Comment pulse
- Concern: Hungary’s 2026 election vulnerable to Russian-aligned manipulation → ruling Fidesz seen bypassing ad rules while pro‑EU, educated Hungarians emigrate, weakening internal democratic resistance.  
- Account price alone is misleading → influence depends on geography, longevity, and ban risk; stricter SIM regimes (e.g., Japan) raise costs and limit reach.  
- Effect on voting remains debated → some doubt measurable persuasion, others stress “consensus mirage,” where coordinated praise creates false majority opinion — counterpoint: evidence sparse.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat the SMS-verification market like financial markets—continuous monitoring can flag manipulation surges earlier than post-hoc content analysis.  
- Impact: Regulators, election watchdogs, and platforms can prioritize high-risk countries or services where prices or volumes deviate sharply from baselines.  
- Watch next: Correlate price spikes with campaigns or narratives, and model how SIM regulations shift manipulation to alternative channels.
