### TL;DR
Dick Van Dyke has turned 100, capping a uniquely long career spanning live TV, film musicals, physical comedy, and even early home-computer animation as an Amiga enthusiast. Hacker News commenters mostly celebrate him as a rare, almost universally liked entertainer whose work—from The Dick Van Dyke Show to later variety shows—remains joyful and technically impressive. They highlight his resilience (including alcoholism, heavy smoking, and remarkable fitness into old age), share favorite episodes, and marvel at how his lifespan overlaps so much of US history.

### Comment pulse
- Enduring comedic genius → People praise his rubbery physicality, dance numbers, and specific standout episodes; many say they wanted to “be” him at different life stages.  
- Remarkable longevity → His exercise quote, surviving alcoholism, and even a dolphin rescue at 84 frame him as improbably tough and still defiantly active.  
- Perspective on history → His birth predating modern America’s maturity sparks amazement about short US history and long human lifespans—counterpoint: his age is an extreme outlier.

### LLM perspective
- View: Van Dyke embodies continuity across eras—vaudeville-flavored TV, film, early CGI/Amiga tinkering, and modern streaming rediscovery.  
- Impact: Renewed viewing of his catalog can guide restoration priorities and cultural-history teaching about mid‑20th‑century entertainment.  
- Watch next: Look for better-documented retrospectives on his Amiga/animation experiments as retro‑computing interest intersects with TV history.
