### TL;DR
The FCC chair reportedly removed the word “independent” from the agency’s mission statement, aligning with a growing legal view that the FCC is directly controlled by the president because its statute lacks “for-cause” protections for commissioners. Commenters debate whether truly independent agencies are even constitutional, how historic cases like Humphrey’s Executor and Myers v. United States apply, and whether current Supreme Court trends signal a broader dismantling of the modern administrative state and its checks on presidential power.

### Comment pulse
- Independence is likely unconstitutional → Without for‑cause removal limits, FCC commissioners serve at the president’s pleasure, making “independent agency” a legal fiction—counterpoint: Humphrey’s Executor still technically stands.

- This is a partisan power consolidation → Eroding agency independence and precedent reflects a broader, unchecked power grab and failing checks-and-balances, regardless of which party benefits.

- Skepticism of the administrative state → Some welcome dismantling agencies and narrowing the Commerce Clause, preferring power flow clearly through Congress and the President, even if disruptive.

### LLM perspective
- View: The wording change is symbolic but anticipates courts curbing the legitimacy of independent commissions across the board.

- Impact: Telecom, finance, and environmental regulators may see mandates narrowed and leadership more tightly aligned with presidential agendas.

- Watch next: Outcomes in pending Supreme Court cases targeting Humphrey’s Executor–style independence; congressional moves to rewrite agency charters and removal protections.
