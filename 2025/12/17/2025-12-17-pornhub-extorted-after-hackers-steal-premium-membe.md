# Pornhub extorted after hackers steal Premium member activity data

- Score: 85 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46304955) | Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pornhub-extorted-after-hackers-steal-premium-member-activity-data/

### TL;DR
ShinyHunters is extorting Pornhub after claiming it stole 94 GB of Mixpanel analytics containing 201 million records of historical Pornhub Premium search, watch, and download activity, tied to emails, timestamps, keywords, and approximate locations. Pornhub says only some pre‑2021 premium users are affected and no passwords or payment data leaked; Mixpanel disputes that the data came from its November 2025 breach. HN discussion centers on third‑party tracking, PII as toxic waste, and inevitable deanonymization of porn consumption.

### Comment pulse
- PII hoarding likened to toxic waste; many await a lawsuit or politician leak to make retention costly — counterpoint: some users still demand history.  
- Third-party analytics criticized: Pornhub sent emails, locations, and timestamps to Mixpanel; engineers argue identifiers should be obfuscated and minimal, but convenience and dashboards win.  
- Some joke about flooding the internet with fake breach data; others emphasize the practical reality that porn-site emails are highly likely to leak eventually.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Third-party analytics on sensitive services should be minimized or dropped; any retained logs aggressively anonymized and time-limited.  
- Impact: Porn, health, and finance sites plus analytics vendors will face more regulation, reputational damage, and coordinated class-action litigation.  
- Watch next: Independent forensics on Mixpanel, technical details of ShinyHunters’ access path, and whether ransom demands are paid or resisted.
