# Gemini 3 Flash: Frontier intelligence built for speed

- Score: 734 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301851) | Link: https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/

### TL;DR
- Google’s Gemini 3 Flash is a new “frontier” model optimized for speed and low cost while keeping near–Gemini 3 Pro reasoning, multimodal understanding, and strong coding/agent capabilities.  
- Benchmarks show PhD-level reasoning scores and leading multimodal performance, while using fewer “thinking” tokens than earlier Pro models and being several times faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro.  
- It’s now the default in the Gemini app and AI Mode in Search, and available across Google’s dev stack; HN commenters report it outperforming GPT‑5.x and Claude Sonnet/Opus on both quality and price, though they note steadily rising Flash prices and OpenAI’s weaker offer for fast, low‑latency models.

### Comment pulse
- Gemini 3 Flash feels like the new fast default → many report it beating GPT‑5.x and Claude in practical evals while staying extremely responsive.  
- Pricing trend worries some → each Flash generation costs more, and GPT‑5 mini is cheaper per token—counterpoint: value vs Gemini 2.5 Pro has massively improved.  
- Enthusiastic but cautious → skeptics see clear gains on tricky niche questions; others still prefer Claude for complex tool use and explore OSS like Nemotron 3 Nano.

### LLM perspective
- View: Google is weaponizing “fast-enough frontier” models, targeting everyday workflows rather than just headline-grabbing max‑capability systems.  
- Impact: Developers gain a strong, latency-friendly default; Android/Workspace integration could quietly lock in Gemini as the ambient assistant layer.  
- Watch next: Flash Lite pricing, independent hallucination/error studies, and OpenAI’s response on genuinely competitive fast models and better tooling.
