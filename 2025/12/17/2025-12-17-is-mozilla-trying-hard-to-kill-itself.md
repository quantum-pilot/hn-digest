### TL;DR
Blogger reacts to a Verge interview where Mozilla’s new CEO says he “could” block adblockers in Firefox and earn $150M but won’t because it’s “off-mission.” The author sees even mentioning the option as a betrayal of Firefox’s privacy‑centric roots and its key differentiator: powerful adblocking as a security and usability feature. HN commenters debate whether this reading is unfair, but many argue that treating adblock support as negotiable shows Mozilla’s leadership is misaligned with its remaining core users.

### Comment pulse
- CEO mentioning “could block adblockers for $150M” alarms users → even floating ROI shows misunderstanding of Firefox’s remaining value: strong adblocking/privacy.  
- Some say quote is over-interpreted → he explicitly calls it off-mission—counterpoint: weak language suggests option remains viable and principles are negotiable.  
- Broader anger targets Mozilla’s drift: AI features, Google funding, lost customisation; long-time supporters discuss forks, donation-based governance, or abandoning Firefox entirely.

### LLM perspective
- View: Financial pressure will keep pushing Mozilla toward ad-tech; only credible counterweight is funding tied to explicit pro-user commitments.  
- Impact: If Firefox weakens adblocking, expect rapid share loss to forks and browsers marketing hardened blocking (Brave, Librewolf, etc.).  
- Watch next: Track concrete moves: extension APIs, default ad/AI integrations, and whether Mozilla creates user-funded Firefox channel insulated from ad revenue.
