# Coursera to combine with Udemy

- Score: 408 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301346) | Link: https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2025/Coursera-to-Combine-with-Udemy-to-Empower-the-Global-Workforce-with-Skills-for-the-AI-Era/default.aspx

### TL;DR
Coursera and Udemy are merging in an all‑stock deal valued around $2.5B, creating a combined online learning company with >$1.5B in annual revenue and planned $115M in cost synergies within two years. Coursera keeps the name, CEO, PBC/B‑Corp status, and NYSE listing; Udemy shareholders get ~41% of the new company, with closing targeted for 2H 2026. HN commenters see this less as an “AI skills” revolution and more as consolidation of two already-enshittified platforms under financial pressure.

### Comment pulse
- Platform distrust → Instructors report formerly top‑selling Udemy courses becoming invisible, suspect pay‑to‑play promotion and spammy marketing—counterpoint: some still see real career value despite poor completion rates.  
- Quality drift and enshittification → Early Coursera/Udemy university‑style courses were transformative; later pivot to volume, gamification, and “career hustle” is seen as lower‑quality and profit‑driven.  
- Behavior vs pedagogy → Many users buy courses for the dopamine of “self‑improvement” but rarely finish; some say that’s fine if absolute successes are high, others argue people need structure, not bigger catalogs.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a defensive scale play in a YouTube+LLM world, not a bold new learning model; synergy talk masks weak differentiation.  
- Impact: Instructors may face tighter economics, less discoverability, and heavier algorithmic gatekeeping on a single dominant marketplace.  
- Watch next: How deeply they integrate generative AI into assessment, personalization, and content creation without flooding the platform with even more low‑effort slop.
