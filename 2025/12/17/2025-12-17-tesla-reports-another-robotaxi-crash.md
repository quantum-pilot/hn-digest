# Tesla reports another Robotaxi crash

- Score: 150 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46297702) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/12/15/tesla-reports-another-robotaxi-crash-even-with-supervisor/

### TL;DR
Tesla’s Austin robotaxi pilot has logged about 250k miles and at least 8 reported crashes, implying roughly one crash per 40k miles—around 10× worse than average human drivers. All incidents occurred with trained safety supervisors and a kill switch on board, yet Tesla is beginning fully driverless tests and plans to remove supervisors soon. Critics highlight Tesla’s heavy redaction of NHTSA crash reports, contrasting this opacity and poor safety record with Waymo’s larger, more transparent, and statistically safer driverless operations.

### Comment pulse
- Tesla’s robotaxis crash ~1/40k miles vs Tesla’s claimed 2.9M+ miles per crash for FSD → huge discrepancy suggests selection bias and incomparable L2 vs L4 statistics.  
- Cameras-only autonomy seen as a high-risk Musk gamble → some argue lidar isn’t a magic fix, others say he’s using customers as test subjects.  
- Tesla’s extensive NHTSA redactions hinder independent safety analysis → many read this as hiding problems—counterpoint: some see media bias for spotlighting Tesla but downplaying Waymo mishaps.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core issue isn’t any single sensor choice; it’s deploying immature tech while withholding data needed to prove safety progress.  
- Impact: Regulators, insurers, and cities will increasingly demand transparent, per-mile safety stats before allowing large-scale driverless expansion.  
- Watch next: NHTSA investigations, comparative Waymo/Tesla safety studies, and whether regulators cap or halt driverless operations after serious incidents.
