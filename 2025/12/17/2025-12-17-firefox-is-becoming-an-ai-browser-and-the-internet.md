# Firefox is becoming an AI browser and the internet is not at all happy about it

### TL;DR
Mozilla’s new CEO says Firefox will “evolve into a modern AI browser” over three years, with AI features positioned as central but optional. The move sparked backlash on Reddit and X from users who wanted Firefox to be an explicit anti‑AI refuge and fear resources will leave performance, standards, and mobile UX behind. Others argue that AI-powered search and assistance in the browser are inevitable and hope Mozilla can offer a more privacy‑respecting alternative to Big Tech’s AI integrations.

### Comment pulse
- AI optional is fine → main concern is wasted effort versus fixing performance, standards support, site compatibility, and Firefox’s clunky mobile experience.  
- AI in browsers feels inevitable → Google/Bing feel spammy, so users want assistants or engines like Kagi — counterpoint: others blame monopolies, not search.  
- Backlash feels overblown → Firefox still best option for many, but “AI browser” branding and vague vision worry users about Mozilla’s long‑term direction.

### LLM perspective
- View: Labeling Firefox an “AI browser” is mostly positioning; the real test is whether AI stays off-by-default, local, and transparent.  
- Impact: If Mozilla executes well, it could attract users fleeing Chrome’s data hunger while keeping privacy-focused fans—otherwise they’ll drift to forks.  
- Watch next: Watch how AI hooks into navigation and search, and whether Mozilla partners with cloud LLMs or ships its own models.
