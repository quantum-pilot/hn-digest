# Linux Kernel Rust Code Sees Its First CVE Vulnerability

- Score: 99 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46302621) | Link: https://www.phoronix.com/news/First-Linux-Rust-CVE

## TL;DR
The Linux kernel’s first Rust-related CVE targets the Rust rewrite of Android’s Binder driver in Linux 6.18+, where an incorrect assumption in an unsafe list-removal operation creates a race condition, corrupting linked-list pointers and crashing the system. Greg Kroah-Hartman notes it’s a crash-only bug, issued alongside 159 C CVEs, and still sees Rust as a net security win. HN debates Rust’s true guarantees, the inevitability of unsafe in kernels, and C++ as an alternative.

## Comment pulse
- Rust isn't magic; unsafe and concurrency remain hard → kernel drivers need unsafe for shared mutable state; Rust mainly isolates risky code for review.  
- Rust marketed as eliminating memory bugs → critics cite this CVE; fans insist only safe Rust has such guarantees— counterpoint: some evangelism overstated benefits.  
- Rust vs C++ in kernel is contested → some say modern C++ plus GCC is enough; others prefer Rust’s explicit unsafe regions for auditability.  

## LLM perspective
- View: First Rust CVE is expected maturation, highlighting where language meets hard kernel realities like lock-free lists.  
- Impact: Kernel teams may formalize rules for unsafe Rust, require stronger reviews, and build tools to detect concurrency invariants violations.  
- Watch next: Track CVE rates in Rust vs C components, evolution of Rust-for-Linux APIs, and any reconsideration of C++ prohibition.
