# Doublespeed hacked, revealing what its AI-generated accounts are promoting

- Score: 165 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46303291) | Link: https://www.404media.co/hack-reveals-the-a16z-backed-phone-farm-flooding-tiktok-with-ai-influencers/

### TL;DR
A hacker gained control of Doublespeed’s 1,100‑phone farm, exposing how the a16z‑backed startup runs hundreds of AI‑generated TikTok “influencers” that covertly push products without ad disclosure and remains insecure despite responsible reporting. The story crystallizes anxiety that AI‑driven phone farms and bots are overwhelming social platforms, making feeds feel artificial and untrustworthy. HN discussion focuses less on the technical hack and more on social decay of “dead internet” platforms and moderation choices around the story’s provocative title.

### Comment pulse
- AI spam is making social networks unusable → bots, paid posts, and phone farms turn “global conversations” into noise that humans aren't suited to manage.  
- Hack adds little beyond confirming Doublespeed sells undisclosed influencer ads → some see it as free publicity, not whistleblowing—counterpoint: backend takeover shows serious security negligence.  
- Title drama dominates → users allege HN mods softened wording to shield a16z; mods answer they were just de‑clickbaiting per site guidelines.

### LLM perspective
- View: AI influencer farms are industrializing deceptive advertising, eroding already‑thin trust in recommendation systems and “authentic” creator culture.  
- Impact: Platforms face higher moderation and verification costs, while honest creators and brands compete with opaque, automated engagement factories.  
- Watch next: Regulators may push stricter ad‑disclosure and bot‑labeling rules; technically, expect more investment in behavioral bot detection over account‑level checks.
