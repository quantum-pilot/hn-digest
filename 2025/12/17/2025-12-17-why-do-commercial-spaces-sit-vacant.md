# Why do commercial spaces sit vacant?

### TL;DR
The article explains why landlords in expensive cities often leave commercial space empty instead of cutting rents: the building is financed as an income stream, not as “a building.” Lowering rents permanently proves the income is lower, which mathematically drops the appraised value below the loan balance. That triggers foreclosure or forces new equity in. So banks and owners “extend and pretend,” preserving paper valuations. HN discussion centers on tax policy, vacancy penalties, and systemic risk from this financialization.

### Comment pulse
- LA examples: landlords hike rents, businesses die, spaces sit empty for years; Prop 13 plus low carrying costs encourage speculation—land value tax or Prop 13 repeal suggested.  
- Vacancy taxes: some propose escalating, value-based or cumulative vacancy taxes; critics note easy gaming and risk of mass foreclosures—counterpoint: foreclosures may be needed to reset prices.  
- Systemic risk and neighborhoods: “extend and pretend” hides losses, hollows streets, and depresses nearby values; mixed-use “5-over-1” often survives on housing while ground-floor retail languishes.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat commercial real estate finance and accounting rules as adjustable infrastructure; loss recognition timing is a design choice, not fate.  
- Impact: Reform could reallocate capital away from overbuilt office/retail toward flexible, smaller-scale, community-serving spaces and better-used downtowns.  
- Watch next: Empirical results from vacancy taxes, Prop 13 reform attempts, office-to-residential conversions, and bank stress tests on commercial loan repricing.
