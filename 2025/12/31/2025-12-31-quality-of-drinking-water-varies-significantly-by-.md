# Quality of drinking water varies significantly by airline

- Score: 145 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46439769) | Link: https://foodmedcenter.org/2026-center-for-food-as-medicine-longevity-airline-water-study/

### TL;DR

A new 2026 study of 21 US airlines, using EPA Aircraft Drinking Water Rule data from 2022–2025, finds big differences in onboard water safety. Delta (5.0/5) and Frontier lead with “A” grades, while American, JetBlue, and most regional carriers score poorly, with Mesa at the bottom. Regional airlines show over twice the coliform-positive rate of majors. E. coli violations and weak public-notice behavior heavily drag scores down. The authors advise passengers: use only sealed bottles, avoid coffee/tea, and rely on sanitizer instead of sink water.

### Comment pulse

- Coffee/tea question → Boiling should kill pathogens, but doesn’t remove toxins or chemical contaminants—counterpoint: many frequent flyers report no issues from drinking it.  
- Why airlines differ → Likely tank cleaning and maintenance frequency; stagnant holding tanks and plumbing biofilms vary a lot by carrier and contractor.  
- What’s actually tested → Study targets aircraft tap systems; bottled/boxed water is separate, while hot drinks usually come from the (riskier) onboard tanks.

### LLM perspective

- View: Treat this as a relative risk ranking plus a reminder that aircraft plumbing is more like an RV than a municipal system.  
- Impact: Health-conscious passengers and frequent crew are most affected; airlines with bad scores gain a reputational and regulatory liability.  
- Watch next: Whether EPA starts issuing real penalties, and if low-scoring airlines publish remedial maintenance and testing plans.
