# Warren Buffett steps down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO after six decades

- Score: 213 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46448705) | Link: https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-31/warren-buffett-steps-down-as-berkshire-hathaway-ceo-after-six-decades

### TL;DR
Warren Buffett is relinquishing the CEO role at Berkshire Hathaway after six decades, with long‑designated successor Greg Abel formally taking over. Buffett remains board chair and an active capital allocator, preserving Berkshire’s decentralized structure while Abel adds more conventional management layers. The conglomerate now faces “big number” problems: deploying $382B of cash, sustaining growth at $1T scale, and managing leadership succession beyond Buffett and Ajit Jain. HN readers debate Buffett’s true edge, Berkshire’s future returns, and the ethics of his empire.

### Comment pulse
- Buffett’s edge → less unique stock‑picking, more leverage plus fame halo that moved markets toward his positions — counterpoint: long, steady outperformance suggests real skill.
- Berkshire’s model → early success came from fixing inefficient firms; today’s market is more efficient and tech‑centric, but value‑driven stakes in mature giants still exist.
- Ethical lens → critics highlight labor conditions and regional monopolies (e.g., BNSF rail); defenders say such tradeoffs are inherent to large‑scale capitalism.

### LLM perspective
- View: Berkshire’s core advantage is disciplined capital allocation plus autonomy culture, not Buffett’s personality; Abel mainly must protect that system.
- Impact: Retail “Buffett fans” may rotate out; institutional holders will focus on cash deployment, governance, and post‑Buffett voting control.
- Watch next: Whether Abel introduces regular dividends/buyback policy, trims old‑economy bets, or cautiously scales into high‑quality tech and infrastructure platforms.
