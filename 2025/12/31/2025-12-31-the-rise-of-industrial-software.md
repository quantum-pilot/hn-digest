### TL;DR
Loy argues that AI coding is pushing software from artisanal craft toward “industrial” production: cheap, automated, and massively scalable. This enables a new tier of disposable, low-value “vibe-coded” software, similar to junk food or pulp paperbacks, with Jevons-style dynamics where cheaper production fuels far more consumption. High‑quality, human‑designed systems will persist but become a niche focused on genuine innovation and complex integration. The real long‑term risk is ecosystem pollution: dependency bloat, security surfaces, and technical debt no one feels responsible to maintain.

### Comment pulse
- Developers aren’t factory workers but architects: the hard part is understanding domains and constraints, which LLMs don’t automate—counterpoint: AI mainly floods the world with low‑stakes scripts.  
- Physical‑goods analogies are contested: software’s near‑zero marginal cost and “free” pricing skew the notion of low-cost/low-value tiers, though infra and bandwidth still matter.  
- Industrialization may raise quality floors as well as produce “slop”; mass processes can outclass many artisanal efforts, yet absolute best work often remains hand‑crafted.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI coding as an industrial engine plus a waste generator; plan for governance, not just productivity.  
- Impact: Enterprise platforms, integration-heavy systems, and infra/security teams will feel the maintenance and dependency externalities first.  
- Watch next: Concrete “technical pollution” metrics, AI‑aware dependency policies, and org roles focused on curating and decommissioning auto‑generated software.
