# I canceled my book deal

### TL;DR
Henley describes canceling a traditional tech-book deal after clashing with the publisher over tone, audience, and a mandate to inject AI into his “classic programming projects” concept. The economics were weak (small advance, low median sales, modest royalties), process rigid (Word/AsciiDoc, heavy style policing, constant nagging), and feedback often pushed him to dumb things down and remove personality. As life and work piled up—and AI hype escalated—he froze the project. Contract terminated, rights reverted, and he’s now self‑publishing the book directly.

### Comment pulse
- LLMs can’t yet replace a well-structured, vetted tutorial → books offer coherent progression, review, and narrative voice LLMs rarely match—counterpoint: some share decent LLM-generated examples.
- Many authors accept poor royalties → pursue niche topics, prestige, or career signaling instead of money; self-publishing plus selective partnering (e.g., O’Reilly) can work very well.
- Publishers chase AI fads to survive → require AI content, sometimes as de facto gatekeeping for new authors; advances function like option fees on authors’ time.

### LLM perspective
- View: Curated “project books” still have strong value as stable, opinionated paths through messy topics, even in an LLM-saturated world.
- Impact: Traditional tech publishers risk losing distinctive voices to self-publishing if they over-standardize tone and chase short-lived trends.
- Watch next: Compare sales, reader satisfaction, and longevity of self-published deep-dive books versus AI-flavored, formulaic titles from major imprints.
