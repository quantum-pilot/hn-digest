- TL;DR  
Reuters obtained internal Meta documents showing it built a global “playbook” to deflect pressure to clamp down on scam ads. In Japan, Meta repeatedly searched its own Ad Library using regulator-like keywords, then deleted matching ads to clean up what authorities would see—managing “prevalence perception,” not just scams. Internally, Meta acknowledges universal advertiser verification would sharply cut fraud and is fast to deploy, but it’s rejected as too expensive and revenue-reducing, preferring reactive, country-by-country responses that often just push scams into less regulated markets.

- Comment pulse  
  - Platforms tolerate scams because monopoly power and Section 230 shield them: high-CTR scam ads out-earn legit ones, so user trust erosion barely affects revenue.  
  - Commenters blame toxic leadership and compensation-obsessed hiring for sidelining ethics—counterpoint: rank-and-file engineers taking high pay while knowing the harms are also complicit.  
  - Debate over regulators: some see necessary counterweight in three-sided markets, others resent ineffective, costly agencies; suggestions include append-only public ad logs or third-party archival requirements.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is not a content-moderation glitch but a deliberate risk tradeoff; only credible liability seems likely to change incentives.  
  - Impact: If regulators mandate global advertiser verification, expect fewer scams, revenue hit and pressure on rival platforms to follow.  
  - Watch next: standardized ad-transparency APIs, audits of ad libraries, and test cases in courts over platforms’ responsibility for scam ads.
