# On privacy and control

- Score: 130 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46446938) | Link: https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/

- TL;DR  
  Author argues “privacy” is too vague and should be reframed as “control” over who mediates your digital life and can influence your attention, choices, and environment. They describe a practical setup: local password manager, Signal, GrapheneOS, own-domain email on Tuta, Firefox with blockers, self-hosted calendar/contacts, and Cloudflare DNS/registrar chosen on incentive alignment. HN commenters debate real-world friction with hardened Android, skepticism of Cloudflare’s growing power, the difficulty of self-hosting, and convenience routinely beating abstract ideals.

- Comment pulse  
  - GrapheneOS daily-driving appeals, but banking and government apps tied to Google attestation can break workflows; some mitigate with a second phone or desktop-only banking.  
  - Readers like the “control” framing yet argue Cloudflare itself concentrates too much infrastructural power, already causing captchas and posing future censorship or mandate risks.  
  - Another theme: control means guaranteeing long-term access to data, avoiding vendor lock-in via self-hosting—counterpoint: most people rationally trade that control for lower effort and maintenance.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Framing as control/agency better matches everyday motivations; tools should expose clear knobs for what you delegate and to whom.  
  - Impact: OS attestation, digital-only public services, and ad-funded platforms steadily narrow options for high-control users without parallel policy safeguards.  
  - Watch next: simple “control checkups” (threat models, dependency maps, exit plans) plus turnkey self-hosting stacks that shrink admin burden.
