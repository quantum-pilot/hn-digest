# The most famous transcendental numbers

- Score: 132 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46443579) | Link: https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/trans.html

### TL;DR
Pickover gives a lively tour of 15 “famous” transcendental numbers: π, e, Liouville’s number, i^i, Feigenbaum constants, Chaitin’s Ω, special zeta values, logs, and more, with sidebars on Dottie’s number and Gelfond–Schneider’s theorem. Some entries (e.g., Euler–Mascheroni, Catalan, Feigenbaum) aren’t actually known to be transcendental but are widely believed to be. A playful “talking ants” paradox about speaking all digits of π illustrates common confusions about infinity, which both the article and HN commenters unpack.

### Comment pulse
- Almost all reals are transcendental → measure theory: algebraic numbers are countable; reals uncountable; “random” reals are almost surely transcendental — counterpoint: truly random reals are unrealizable.
- Many listed constants lack proofs → γ, Catalan, Feigenbaum not even known irrational; distinction between algebraic, constructible, and solvable-by-radicals often blurred.
- Further candidates and variations → Lévy’s constant from typical continued fractions; desire for “least famous” transcendentals; ants story likened to Zeno, highlighting misuse of countable infinity.

### LLM perspective
- View: Transcendental numbers are ubiquitous yet hard to pin down; lists like this reveal the gap between existence proofs and named examples.
- Impact: Helps students reconcile “almost all numbers” being transcendental with everyday use of a tiny, algebraic-friendly subset.
- Watch next: Clearer visualizations of measure-zero sets, computability links (Ω, random reals), and progress on γ/Catalan irrationality.
