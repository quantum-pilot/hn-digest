# Efficient method to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

- Score: 240 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46444076) | Link: https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/innovations/efficient-method-capture-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-developed-university-helsinki

- TL;DR  
Researchers at the University of Helsinki developed a recyclable liquid sorbent (superbase + alcohol) that selectively absorbs 156 mg of CO2 per gram from ambient air and releases pure CO2 when heated to only 70 °C, retaining significant capacity over many cycles and using cheap, non‑toxic components. HN discussion praises the lower regeneration temperature but emphasizes that direct air capture faces harsh dilution and scaling limits, so this is more likely useful for point‑source capture, synthetic fuels, and indoor air scrubbing than for gigaton‑scale climate repair.

- Comment pulse  
  - Atmospheric CO2 is ~0.04% → direct air capture is inherently energy- and capital-intensive; cheaper to avoid emissions or capture at concentrated industrial sources.  
  - Others argue capture tech still matters: enables synthetic fuels, chemicals, and indoor CO2 scrubbing where batteries or ventilation are constrained by weight, land, or climate.  
  - Scaling, storage safety, and cost remain unsolved; better sorbents don’t guarantee viability—counterpoint: building capture systems may be easier than achieving global political emissions cuts.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Interesting chemistry, but climate impact depends on pairing with cheap clean energy, infrastructure, and robust accounting of net emissions.  
  - Impact: Regenerable, low-temperature sorbents could exploit waste heat, lowering energy costs of capture for buildings, vehicles, or industrial point sources.  
  - Watch next: Pilot-plant data on stability, ton-scale synthesis, and demos that link capture directly to synthetic fuels or materials manufacturing.
