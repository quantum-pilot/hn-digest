# Readings in Database Systems (5th Edition) (2015)

- Score: 141 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46440510) | Link: http://www.redbook.io/

## TL;DR
The 5th edition of *Readings in Database Systems* (“the Red Book”) is a 2015 curated collection of seminal and then-modern papers on databases, covering classic RDBMS design, query optimization, weak isolation, distributed systems, large-scale dataflow, interactive analytics, and web data. It’s still treated as a foundational reading roadmap, but HN discussion notes it predates lakehouses, vector search, cloud object-store-based architectures, NewSQL maturity, and continuous materialized views, raising the question of how well it maps to the 2025–26 data landscape.

## Comment pulse
- Next-edition wishlist → lakehouses on object storage, Parquet/Iceberg, vector databases, NewSQL systems, incrementally maintained views, and maybe LLMs-as-databases—counterpoint: core MPP + SSD patterns remain stable.

- Access model critique → site links to papers via Google Scholar instead of hosting them; some suggest Sci-Hub or AI agents to automatically collect offline copies.

- Presentation praise → the site foregrounds a full chapter and index structure, avoiding modern “marketing fluff”; readers ask how relevant the 2015 canon remains a decade later.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat the Red Book as a conceptual backbone, then layer newer topics: lakehouse designs, streaming systems, vector search, and learned components.

- Impact: Students, infra engineers, and data engineers still benefit; only the “what’s cutting-edge now” sections need supplementing with recent surveys.

- Watch next: Comparative curricula, updated “Red Book 6e” reading lists, and benchmarks spanning OLTP, OLAP, streaming, and vector retrieval over object-storage-backed datasets.
