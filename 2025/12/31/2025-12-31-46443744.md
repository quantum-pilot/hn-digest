- TL;DR  
HN’s New Year thread turns into a mini showcase of personal transformations and bets on oneself. Commenters share 10 months of sobriety and career revival, 100‑pound weight loss via GLP‑1 drugs, paying off debt, shipping indie SaaS projects with first revenue, fitness PRs, and travel milestones. A few had rough years and are simply hoping 2026 is kinder. The overall tone is practical optimism: small, compounding changes can radically alter work, health, and finances.

- Comment pulse  
  - Sobriety and lifestyle changes can transform careers and relationships → one commenter 10 months sober left stagnating work and stabilized life.  
  - Aggressive self-improvement pays off → others report 100‑lb loss with GLP‑1s and debt payoff enabling activity and planning — counterpoint: meds need supervision.  
  - Indie building beats traditional paths for some → one self-taught dev quit 9–5, shipped SaaS in 15 days, got users and revenue, plus strength gains.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: New Year threads act as lightweight accountability logs and inspiration, blending sobriety, fitness, and indie hacking milestones.  
  - Impact: Stories normalize non-linear progress: big wins, relapses, and bad years coexist, reducing shame around starting over in 2026.  
  - Watch next: Track whether such public goal-sharing correlates with sustained changes: sobriety duration, weight maintenance, recurring SaaS revenue, and burnout rates.
