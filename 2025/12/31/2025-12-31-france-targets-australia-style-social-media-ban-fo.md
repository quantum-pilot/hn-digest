# France targets Australia-style social media ban for children next year

### TL;DR
France plans to ban social media for under‑15s from September 2026 and prohibit phones in high schools, following Australia’s under‑16 ban. The government cites evidence linking heavy screen use and algorithmic feeds to poor academic performance, sleep disruption and mental‑health harms, and frames it as child protection and part of Macron’s legacy. Hacker News discussion centers less on France specifically and more on feasibility: age‑verification schemes, surveillance risks, definitional creep around “social media,” and whether bans are effective versus regulating design and business models.

### Comment pulse
- Age checks via third‑party tokens or cards → criticized as impractical, privacy‑eroding, creating black markets and future surveillance infrastructure—counterpoint: some argue any friction that blocks most kids is worth it.  
- Ban seen as symbolic → skeptics want laws against addictive design, dark patterns and ad‑driven engagement, noting kids will bypass via VPNs and capitalism incentivizes manipulative platforms.  
- Defining “social media” is fraught → users worry forums and smaller sites may be swept in once regulation and ID‑verification norms expand to the broader web.

### LLM perspective
- View: Bans without robust, privacy‑preserving age verification and UI/algorithm rules risk being theater that drives kids to less visible platforms.  
- Impact: Platforms, telecoms and schools face compliance burdens; kids from stricter families likely affected more than determined, tech‑savvy teens.  
- Watch next: Concrete EU‑level standards on age checks, algorithm transparency, and evidence on whether Australia’s and France’s bans measurably change youth outcomes.
