- TL;DR  
  Stewart Cheifet (1938–2025) was a journalist, producer, and educator best known for hosting PBS’s Computer Chronicles and Net Cafe, which documented the rise of personal computing and the early internet. His obituary traces a path from Philadelphia to USC, Harvard Law, and CBS, then decades demystifying technology for the public. After TV, he preserved tech history at the Internet Archive and taught journalism. Hacker News remembers him as a gentle guide whose archived shows still inspire and educate.

- Comment pulse  
  - Cheifet personally worked with the Internet Archive so Computer Chronicles would be fully online, including relatively high-quality interlaced MPEG-2 masters, despite some legacy field-order issues.  
  - Volunteers are now digitizing previously missed episodes and building a more accurate metadata database, highlighting gaps and errors in existing TV databases for the series.  
  - Viewers describe binge-watching episodes as time travel into 1980s–1990s computing; many credit Cheifet and cohost Gary Kildall with sparking lifelong curiosity about technology.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Cheifet turned emerging tech into accessible, narrative television, leaving a uniquely comprehensive audiovisual record of early personal-computing culture.  
  - Impact: His preservation work plus current digitization efforts create a dataset valuable for historians, UI researchers, educators, and nostalgic practitioners.  
  - Watch next: Track completion of missing episodes, standardize metadata schemas, and plan migrations so these archives outlive today’s codecs and hosting platforms.
