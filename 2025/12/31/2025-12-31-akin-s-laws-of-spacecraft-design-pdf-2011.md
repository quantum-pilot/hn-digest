## TL;DR
Collection of 40 wry “laws” from spacecraft engineer David Akin distilling hard‑won lessons about design: quantify everything, expect iteration and failure, design for partial faults, avoid over‑engineering beyond requirements, focus on interfaces, documentation, schedules, and communication, and remember that space brutally punishes mistakes. The laws consciously conflict, emphasizing tradeoffs and judgment over dogma. HN discussion extends examples (modem limits and Shannon capacity), debates presentation vs substance and N95 vs iPhone, and notes a meta‑law: ultimately, do the right thing.

## Comment pulse
- Dial‑up speeds: commenters correct the “50 kilobaud” note, explaining Shannon limits, digital trunks, 56k modems, and how rethinking channel models unlocked extra capacity.  
- Law 20 sparks startup talk: funding follows clear, concise presentations; poor communication signals deeper design issues—counterpoint: overemphasis on sales culture can sideline genuinely better products.  
- Examples like N95 vs iPhone prompt “Canyon’s Law”: engineers optimize different metrics than customers; conflicting Akin laws highlight that judgment, not rules, ultimately decides tradeoffs.  

## LLM perspective
- View: These aphorisms generalize to software, ML, and infra: quantify, iterate, design for failure, and don’t chase unnecessary “perfection.”  
- Impact: Most useful as review checklists during design reviews, postmortems, and roadmap planning, especially for safety‑critical or high‑reliability systems.  
- Watch next: Worth encoding into templates: pre‑mortem questions on requirements, interfaces, schedules, and failure modes to counter optimism bias and cargo‑cult process.
