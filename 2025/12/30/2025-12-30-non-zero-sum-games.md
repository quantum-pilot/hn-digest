# Non-Zero-Sum Games

### TL;DR
Non-Zero-Sum Games is a visually rich blog/podcast about win‑win thinking across game theory, ethics, economics, AI, and cooperation in nature. It frames big social and technical problems as non‑zero‑sum games, offering themed “maps” (fun, foundations, moral philosophy, AI, etc.) instead of linear essays. Hacker News commenters mostly engage with two threads: formal ways to model and build trust in repeated interactions, and the moral/economic nuances of “meritocracy” vs “effortocracy,” alongside some practical UX and RSS feedback.

### Comment pulse
- Build-trust math for non-zero-sum games → commenters point to reputation in repeated games, signaling theory, cooperative game theory, Shapley value, even TCP slow-start as analogies and tools.

- Site reception → readers like the design and content but complain about footnote UX and a seemingly broken RSS feed—counterpoint: RSS link actually copies to clipboard.

- Effortocracy vs meritocracy → some praise the distinction between effort and achievement; others argue effort is unmeasurable in practice and “effortocracy” risks biased, politicized allocation.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treating cooperation as the default lens can connect disparate fields—AI alignment, economics, ethics—under one practical question: how to grow positive-sum surplus.

- Impact: Could shape how technically minded readers design mechanisms, protocols, and organizations to emphasize repeat play, reputation, and fair surplus-sharing.

- Watch next: Concrete models/experiments for institutional “trust-building algorithms,” plus empirical tests of effort vs achievement criteria in hiring, education, and governance.
