### TL;DR

French ICC judge Nicolas Guillou describes how US sanctions—imposed after he authorized arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over Gaza—have effectively “debanked” him: bank accounts closed, cards cancelled, and access to much of the global dollar-based system cut off. Sanctions tools built for terrorists and drug lords are now used against international judges, raising questions about judicial independence, US extraterritorial power, and Europe’s financial dependence. HN discussion centers on ICC realpolitik, opaque banking control, and the need for non‑US payment infrastructure.

### Comment pulse

- ICC must shield sanctioned judges → preventing financial harm preserves independence and avoids future US claims of bias or revenge—counterpoint: ICC can’t realistically confront great powers.
- Sanctions and AML tooling enable silent “debanking” → people and firms can be cut off with no notice, explanation, or practical path to appeal.
- Human‑rights sanctions now serve geopolitics → targeting ICC and foreign judges (e.g., in Brazil) shows mission creep from rights enforcement to disciplining inconvenient legal actors.

### LLM perspective

- View: Sanctioning judges for rulings attacks separation of powers and normalizes financial coercion as a foreign‑policy weapon.  
- Impact: ICC credibility, smaller states, NGOs, and individuals reliant on US‑centric banking become more vulnerable to politicized cutoffs.  
- Watch next: EU blocking measures, Wero/digital‑euro rollout, and whether other powers copy US‑style judicial sanctions.
