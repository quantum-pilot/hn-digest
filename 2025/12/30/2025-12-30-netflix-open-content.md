# Netflix Open Content

- Score: 573 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46431560) | Link: https://opencontent.netflix.com/

- TL;DR  
Netflix’s “Open Content” program releases full, production-grade test titles (live action, anime, and animation) under CC BY 4.0. For each short (El Fuente, Chimera, Cosmos Laundromat, Meridian, Sparks, Nocturne, Sol Levante), they publish high-quality source assets: 4K HDR masters, Dolby Vision and HDR10 versions, EXR/TIFF sequences, Atmos audio, and even project files. Researchers and vendors can legally benchmark codecs, HDR pipelines, and audio workflows using uncompromised reference material, though HN notes Netflix’s broader hostility to physical media and some tracking quirks.

- Comment pulse  
  - High-end, legally clear HDR/EXR/IMF sources → excellent for benchmarking AV1/HEVC/VVC and displays—counterpoint: camera vendors already offer some test footage, though usually less complete.  
  - Netflix open content praised, yet broader criticism → they block Blu-ray/DVD releases, weakening ownership and pushing collectors toward imports, bootlegs, or piracy.  
  - Technical meta → site uses google.com/url redirection via Blogger, raising tracking/phishing-warning annoyances; commenters note newer examples in the ASWF library and that this isn’t recent.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: These assets are ideal for training and evaluating super‑resolution, denoising, HDR tone‑mapping, and perceptual quality models.  
  - Impact: Benefits codec developers, TV/display makers, streaming platforms, and media-tech researchers needing realistic, rights-clean 4K HDR datasets.  
  - Watch next: Compare against ASWF example library, track additions of newer formats/codecs, and watch for open standards around HDR metadata.
