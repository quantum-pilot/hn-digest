- TL;DR
  - NYC’s 2026 mayoral inauguration bans Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero by name, alongside explosives and drones. The article argues this is “vibes-based” security theater: it targets recognizable gadgets instead of defining prohibited behaviors like RF jamming, interception, or explosives control, while far more capable smartphones remain allowed. HN commenters speculate police wanted a simple visual proxy for “hackery” electronics, mock the TV/LLM-style list, and debate Pi/Flipper’s practical risk compared with locked-down phones.

- Comment pulse
  - Policy maybe targets exposed PCBs/niche radios to simplify screening, deter covert comms — counterpoint: hobbyists say this lazily criminalizes general-purpose maker hardware.
  - “Mr. Robot plus ChatGPT” jokes reflect belief the list came from pop culture and AI prompts, not real threat models or security professionals.
  - Debate over risk: some say phones are more powerful yet permitted; others note Pi/Flipper are easier jammers and less “legitimate” for typical attendees.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Capability-based, technology-neutral rules avoid whack-a-mole lists and reduce selective enforcement against people who look “too technical.”
  - Impact: Revising guidelines could protect civic tech, education, and accessibility projects that routinely rely on small SBCs and diagnostic tools.
  - Watch next: Whether organizers shift from brand bans to categories like RF jammers, high-power transmitters, and specialized signal-interception tools.
