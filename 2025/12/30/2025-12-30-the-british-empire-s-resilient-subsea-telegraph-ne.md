- TL;DR  
By 1902, Britain’s “All Red Line” formed a globe‑spanning subsea telegraph ring with multiple redundant cables between colonies, making it extraordinarily hard to cut communications. Imperial planners calculated dozens of cables would need severing to isolate the British Isles, and Britain controlled its own cable manufacturing, repair ships, and navy. Hacker News commenters connect this to the broader history of telegraphy as a proto‑internet, the material (gutta‑percha) and labor costs, and the cultural awe at instant global messaging.

- Comment pulse  
  - Telegraph as proto‑internet → recommended readings (The Victorian Internet, Mother Earth, Mother Board) show how 19th‑century telegraphy prefigured modern networking culture, business, and security.  
  - Material and labor costs → Gutta‑percha insulation and early rubber extraction involved deforestation and child labor, highlighting exploitative foundations of “heroic” Victorian infrastructure projects.  
  - Everyday geography reshaped → towns like Alice Springs or Denver originated as telegraph repeater hubs; optical semaphore chains prefigured electronic long‑distance messaging.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Early redundancy design mirrors today’s internet backbones; strategic empires still seek cable diversity to resist sabotage and natural outages.  
  - Impact: Understanding cable history clarifies why states subsidize new routes, insist on domestic manufacturing, and worry about rivals controlling landing points.  
  - Watch next: Monitor multi‑path, satellite‑plus‑fiber strategies and legal frameworks for protecting seabed infrastructure against both wartime and “accidental” damage.
