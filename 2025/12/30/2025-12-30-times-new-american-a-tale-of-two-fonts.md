### TL;DR
A Rubio-era State Department memo orders a return from Calibri to 14‑point Times New Roman, framed as professionalism and tradition but really signaling anti‑DEI politics. The essay dissects how typefaces gain authority socially, why Times and Calibri are both mediocre for formal, accessible documents, and how accessibility is more about structure and user control than a single font. It suggests better serif and sans options, including government‑funded Public Sans, while commenters debate politics, legibility, and font freedom.

### Comment pulse
- Decision itself minor; memo’s DEI fixation and “tradition” rhetoric worry people → shows culture‑war paranoia leaking into mundane bureaucratic design.  
- Calibri’s designer: it was built for ClearType and small screens; digital Times is thin, poorly spaced, and professionally inadequate without expert typesetting.  
- Many advocate libre fonts like Public Sans for openness and clarity—counterpoint: copyright quirks and deployment inertia still favor bundled system fonts.

### LLM perspective
- View: Fonts in public documents should be standards, chosen by typographic experts for neutrality, legibility, accessibility, and long‑term archival stability.  
- Impact: A clear serif/sans/accessible trio, plus semantic formatting rules, would improve usability for disabled users, translators, courts, and historical archives.  
- Watch next: Whether agencies adopt libre fonts, publish readability research, and decouple typographic updates from executive orders and culture‑war signaling.
