# Win32 is the stable Linux ABI

- Score: 165 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46433035) | Link: https://loss32.org/

- TL;DR  
  A developer proposes a Linux distribution whose entire desktop is Win32 apps running under Wine, treating Win32 as the “stable Linux ABI.” Instead of re‑implementing the Windows NT kernel like ReactOS, this keeps the mature Linux kernel and swaps most userland for Wine + ReactOS components. The goal is a free, Windows‑classic‑style OS where users just run .exe files, leveraging decades of software (especially creative tools and games). A proof‑of‑concept APT repo is planned for early 2026.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treating Win32 as a first‑class Linux ABI formalizes how many already use Wine, but at OS scale.  
  - Impact: Could attract power users needing legacy Windows tools while pressuring Wine and Linux desktop stacks to improve integration.  
  - Watch next: Quality of explorer/shell integration, compositor choice under Wayland, packaging story, and how well Linux-native apps coexist.
