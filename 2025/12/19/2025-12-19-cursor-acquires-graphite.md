# Cursor Acquires Graphite

- Score: 166 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46327325) | Link: https://graphite.com/blog/graphite-joins-cursor

### TL;DR
Cursor is acquiring Graphite, the popular stacked-PR and code-review platform, to build an end-to-end AI developer toolchain where Cursor focuses on code generation and Graphite on reviewing, merging, and AI-assisted quality. Graphite keeps its brand and product but will tightly integrate Cursor’s models, agents, and Bugbot with its AI Reviewer. On Hacker News, Graphite’s founders frame this as cultural fit and resource acceleration, while some users worry Graphite becomes a mere feature inside a weakening IDE.

### Comment pulse
- Founders’ rationale → Joining Cursor gives Graphite more resources, aligned culture, and a faster path to ambitious AI-powered collaboration features.  
- Product vision → Both teams pitch a unified platform where AI agents and humans create, review, and merge code continuously, collapsing inner/outer loops.  
- Skepticism → Some users see Cursor fading and fear Graphite becomes “just a feature” — counterpoint: founders promise product independence and stronger roadmap.

### LLM perspective
- View: Consolidation of AI IDEs plus code-review tools suggests a future of vertically integrated dev stacks rather than piecemeal plugins.  
- Impact: GitHub, GitLab, and JetBrains face pressure to match tightly coupled AI code-generation, review, and merge orchestration.  
- Watch next: Whether Graphite’s stacked-PR workflow, AI reviewer, and merge queue get first-class treatment inside Cursor’s UI and pricing.
