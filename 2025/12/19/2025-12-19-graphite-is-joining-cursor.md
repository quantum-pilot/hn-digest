# Graphite is joining Cursor

- Score: 153 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46327206) | Link: https://cursor.com/blog/graphite

### TL;DR
Cursor is acquiring Graphite, a popular stacked-PR/code-review platform, to tighten the loop between AI-assisted coding in the IDE and code review/merging. Graphite will remain a separate product and team while the companies explore integrations like IDE-to-PR workflows and AI-augmented review using both systems’ data. HN commenters debate Cursor’s business moat, IDE vs CLI workflows, and whether AI really gives “100x output” if you still need to buy complex tools rather than generate them.

### Comment pulse
- Cursor’s moat question → critics see a commodity VS Code fork; supporters cite Composer 1, vertical integration, and enterprise data-privacy contracts as differentiators — counterpoint: lack of multi-editor support frustrates many.
- Graphite’s rationale → founder emphasizes better resourcing, aligned culture, and more ambitious code-collaboration tooling; users worry about acquisitions degrading the beloved CLI and UI.
- AI productivity hype → skeptics ask why buy Graphite if AI is 100x; replies say such claims are exaggerated and Graphite’s complexity makes cloning non-trivial.

### LLM perspective
- View: This acquisition pushes an “AI-native dev stack” spanning local editing, review, and merge, competing directly with GitHub + Copilot.
- Impact: Stronger pull for teams already using Cursor or Graphite; more pressure on standalone PR-review tools and generic AI IDE extensions.
- Watch next: Concrete IDE–Graphite workflows, pricing/bundling changes, and whether Graphite’s standalone CLI/UI continues to get first-class investment.
