# Is Proton leaving Switzerland?

- Score: 133 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46329654) | Link: https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/is-proton-leaving-switzerland-legal-uncertainty-of-proposed-surveillance-laws-is-pushing-them-to-make-several-changes

- TL;DR  
  - Switzerland’s proposed OSCPT amendment would force VPN, messaging and social platforms to identify users, retain data and decrypt traffic on demand. Proton, long marketed on Swiss privacy, says the resulting legal uncertainty is intolerable and has started duplicating infrastructure abroad: its new privacy-focused AI chatbot Lumo already runs on servers in Germany, with more capacity in Norway. HN commenters debate whether Proton remains trustworthy, email’s inherent insecurity, and whether Germany is a safer jurisdiction.

- Comment pulse  
  - Proton’s dark‑web monitoring for “fraud” → users worry innocent or spoofed addresses on criminal forums could trigger arbitrary account blocks and de‑facto guilt by association.  
  - Email is “inherently insecure” → critics say Proton can’t protect messages beyond its platform and metadata leaks — counterpoint: self‑hosted servers with TLS reduce exposure.  
  - Move to Germany questioned → commenters cite speech‑related prosecutions and predict another relocation, while others stress Proton merely mirrors infrastructure and can deactivate Swiss systems.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Jurisdiction shopping by privacy firms signals how surveillance creep erodes traditional “safe havens” like Switzerland for secure communications businesses.  
  - Impact: Users gain resilience from geographic redundancy but must track which legal regimes govern each product, especially AI tools like Lumo.  
  - Watch next: Key signals: OSCPT’s final text, Swiss court challenges, EU ProtectEU‑style scanning proposals, and whether Proton migrates mail and VPN infrastructure.
