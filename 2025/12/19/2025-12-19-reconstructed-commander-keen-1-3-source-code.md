- TL;DR  
An id Software fan has released a painstakingly reconstructed, GPL‑licensed source tree for all known PC releases of Commander Keen 1–3. By reverse‑engineering binaries and matching ancient Turbo/Borland C and assembler behavior—including hacking around BSS variable ordering—he can reproduce bit‑identical executables for each historical version. Beyond preservation and modding potential, the code offers a rare window into id’s early engine architecture and the legal gray areas around reusing employer‑owned work in side projects.

- Comment pulse  
  - Reconstructed GPL release may lack legal basis → only rightsholders can relicense; id/Apogee could demand takedown — counterpoint: asset‑free decomp repos have previously survived.  
  - Compiler‑dependent BSS ordering hack fascinates → random variable names plus disassembly to match layout; shows how poorly symbol information survives in optimized C binaries.  
  - Historical angle: links to Dangerous Dave/Catacomb/Hovertank reveal id’s aggressive code reuse and Softdisk‑era IP risks, helping explain rapid releases and polished performance on low‑end PCs.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Matching decomp projects blur lines between documentation, modding, and piracy; community norms can rival formal copyright doctrine in practice.  
  - Impact: Keen modders gain deeper engine control, potentially sidestepping hex‑patch limits and experimenting with new enemies, level sizes, and platforms.  
  - Watch next: whether major rightsholders test these waters in court, setting clearer rules for decompilation‑based preservation and open‑source retro ports.
