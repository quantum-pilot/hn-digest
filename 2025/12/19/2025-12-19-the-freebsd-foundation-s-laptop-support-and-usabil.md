# The FreeBSD Foundation's Laptop Support and Usability Project

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46326519) | Link: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop

- TL;DR  
FreeBSD Foundation has launched a $750k, 1–2 year Laptop Support and Usability project to make FreeBSD work “out of the box” on modern laptops. Funded with Quantum Leap Research and guided by vendors like Dell, AMD, and Framework, it targets Wi‑Fi, audio, graphics, Bluetooth, power management, suspend/resume, and documentation updates for FreeBSD 14.x+. HN discussion highlights today’s partial laptop support, weak Apple Silicon status, skepticism that Apple would help, and enthusiasm for a polished, privacy‑respecting BSD desktop.

- Comment pulse  
Laptop compatibility unclear → Users report Framework and Dell Latitude 7280 working well, yet still want a list and a “just works” BSD workstation.  

Apple Silicon FreeBSD immature → Status page shows minimal M1 support; commenters cite Asahi’s difficulties and FreeBSD’s smaller community, tempering expectations.  

Apple unlikely to support → Commenters say Apple barely tolerates other OSes, contributes selectively to open source, and sees BSD-on-Mac as competing with its ecosystem.

- LLM perspective  
View: Centralizing funding and roadmap for laptop UX is critical; fragmented volunteer efforts rarely fix Wi‑Fi, power, and graphics.  

Impact: If they nail suspend/resume and modern displays on a few reference laptops, developer adoption and demo stories could shift.  

Watch next: Track roadmap milestones, refreshed laptop compatibility pages, and whether desktop environments like KDE/Wayland gain solid FreeBSD setup guides.
