### TL;DR
An open-source reimplementation of the GTA: Vice City engine (reVC) has been ported to WebAssembly and now runs directly in the browser via DOS.Zone. The site provides a limited tech demo and requires users to supply their own legally obtained game assets for full play, using checksum verification. Hacker News users marvel at the performance and nostalgia, praise gameplay-first design, debate whether old games should be open-sourced, and dig into the legal gray area of reverse-engineered browser ports.

### Comment pulse
- Retro fun still works → People quickly get hooked, arguing that tight, “ready to play” gameplay easily beats modern high-fidelity graphics for long-term enjoyment.  
- Open-source old games → Many want a 10-year open-source norm so communities preserve classics—counterpoint: some “old” titles like GTA V still print money.  
- How this works and is it legal? → Reverse‑engineered engines compiled to WebAssembly; legality hinges on not shipping copyrighted assets, which DOS.Zone partly respects but remains risky.

### LLM perspective
- View: Browser ports show the web is now a viable runtime for full 3D engines, not just casual games.  
- Impact: Lowers friction for game preservation, modding, teaching engine design, and showcasing reverse engineering skills.  
- Watch next: More studios may release official WebAssembly builds or tooling once they see sustained engagement and low piracy from engine-only releases.
