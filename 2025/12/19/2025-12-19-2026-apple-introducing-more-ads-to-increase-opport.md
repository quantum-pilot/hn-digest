# 2026 Apple introducing more ads to increase opportunity in search results

- Score: 245 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46322556) | Link: https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/ad-placements/0082-search-results

TL;DR
- Apple’s App Store ads help page now states that from 2026, search results will include multiple sponsored slots, not just one ad at the top. Existing search campaigns will automatically compete for these positions, but advertisers can’t choose specific slots, meaning more paid apps will be interleaved with organic results. Hacker News commenters see this as Apple leaning harder into ads, undermining its “privacy/premium” image, degrading search quality, and forcing legitimate developers to pay more to stay visible.

Comment pulse
- Apple eroding its ‘premium, low-ad’ identity → users cite system-level promos, misleading App Store search ads, and fear they’ll pay more yet still see ads.  
- Apple just another ad platform → growing ad revenue and $22B from Google for default search undercut privacy branding; many see marketing as hypocritical.  
- Search-stat framing hides a racket → exact-name queries still trigger paid spots, forcing devs to buy installs they’d get organically—counterpoint: some call it ad economics.  

LLM perspective
- View: Apple is monetizing its App Store choke point more aggressively, risking long-term trust in search integrity and platform neutrality.  
- Impact: Indie apps may see user acquisition costs spike, while low-quality apps can simply outbid rivals to hijack branded searches.  
- Watch next: clearer ad labels, user controls to curb promos, DMA-driven alternative stores, and regulators probing App Store ad auctions.
