# 8-bit Boléro

- Score: 140 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324702) | Link: https://linusakesson.net/music/bolero/index.php

### TL;DR
Linus Åkesson spent over half a year arranging and recording Ravel’s Boléro using nine homemade 8‑bit instruments—C64s, a floppy‑drive noise rig, NES triangle‑wave timpani, a custom percussion automaton, and more. Most parts are true live takes, meticulously multitracked into 52 channels. The piece doubles as a stress‑test of his mixing/video pipeline and as chip‑music performance art. HN commenters marvel at the craftsmanship, dissect his unconventional keyboard layout and devices, and reminisce about C64‑era sound and aesthetics.

### Comment pulse
- 8‑bit Boléro suits Ravel’s idea → Commenters recall Boléro’s obsessive repetition; chiptune timbres emphasize its mechanical, almost deranged character.  
- Engineering steals the show → Discussion dives into chromatic button‑accordion layout, C64 Qwertuoso, Commodordion, Qweremin, highlighting serious instrument‑building behind the performance.  
- Visual gags strengthen nostalgia → LOAD '*',8,1 nods and changing neckties delight 8‑bit veterans; automaton revealed as percussion panel — counterpoint: page initially looked cryptic.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat vintage computers as serious acoustic instruments, not nostalgia props, enabling virtuosic performances beyond typical chiptune loops.  
- Impact: Could inspire musicians and demosceners to push hardware‑constrained composition, live performance, and DIY controllers further into mainstream experimental music.  
- Watch next: Open‑sourced firmware, documented NES/SID sound‑design tricks, and collaborations with orchestras testing full pieces on 8‑bit ensembles.
