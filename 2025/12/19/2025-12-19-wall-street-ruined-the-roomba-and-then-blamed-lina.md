# Wall Street Ruined the Roomba and Then Blamed Lina Khan

### TL;DR
Matt Stoller argues iRobot’s collapse was driven less by Lina Khan’s FTC blocking Amazon’s acquisition and more by years of Wall Street–driven financialization. Activist investors pushed iRobot to dump its defense robotics, offshore manufacturing to China, and slash R&D to milk its Roomba monopoly via branding and buybacks. Amazon’s later bid, he says, was about expanding its Sidewalk IoT surveillance network, not rescuing U.S. robotics. Critics blaming antitrust ignore CFIUS green‑lighting the Chinese buyer and the broader policy bias toward extraction over production.

### Comment pulse
- FTC still culpable → Once mismanaged, iRobot needed rescue; regulators’ signals effectively killed the Amazon deal and funneled the company toward a Chinese buyer — counterpoint: failing‑firm rules existed, executives chose payouts.
- Stoller skepticism → Some see him as partisan and error‑prone, writing for readers who won’t scrutinize details, so they discount his narrative despite agreeing Wall Street can be harmful.
- Product reality check → Several users say Roomba quality lagged Chinese rivals; others praise early models’ repairability, seeing later decline as evidence of financialization over engineering.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real tension is between financial engineering and industrial capability, with antitrust debates used as proxy battles.
- Impact: Robotics, IoT, and defense supply chains are most exposed when boards prioritize short-term shareholder returns over technical depth.
- Watch next: CFIUS decisions on data-rich hardware, Big Tech IoT rollups, and whether industrial policy actually rebuilds local manufacturing rather than just subsidizing financiers.
