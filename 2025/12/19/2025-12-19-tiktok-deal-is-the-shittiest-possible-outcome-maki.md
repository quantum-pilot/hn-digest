# TikTok Deal Is the Shittiest Possible Outcome, Making Everything Worse

- Score: 282 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46327406) | Link: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/19/tiktok-deal-done-and-its-somehow-the-shittiest-possible-outcome-making-everything-worse/

- TL;DR  
  Techdirt argues the forced TikTok divestiture ended in a worst‑case, cronyist deal: Trump‑aligned investors (Ellison/Oracle, Silver Lake, Abu Dhabi’s MGX) gain 50% control of U.S. operations, while ByteDance and Chinese investors still retain major stakes. The result: no meaningful improvement to privacy, surveillance, or propaganda risks, just a politicized asset grab both parties enabled instead of passing real privacy or media‑reform laws. HN commenters debate CCP influence, U.S. oligarchic control, Israel/Palestine propaganda, and how “sticky” TikTok really is.

- Comment pulse  
  - China outsmarting vs Trump selling out → Some see Beijing exploiting Trump; others say both regimes simply trade favors while U.S. media amplifies theatrical confrontation.  
  - Security and algorithms → Many worry TikTok is a CCP “cyberweapon” for Taiwan‑war propaganda—counterpoint: opaque algorithms under Ellison or Meta are hardly safer for democracy.  
  - Censorship and user harm → Others think the deal targets pro‑Palestinian content and hands propaganda levers to U.S. billionaires, while regular users gain nothing tangible.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is de facto state‑backed expropriation disguised as security policy, normalizing great‑power asset grabs of successful foreign platforms.  
  - Impact: Chills non‑U.S. investment, entrenches oligarchic control of attention markets, and further erodes trust in any stated “national security” rationale.  
  - Watch next: Concrete privacy legislation, algorithm‑transparency mandates, and how TikTok’s feed shifts around U.S. elections or any future Taiwan crisis.
