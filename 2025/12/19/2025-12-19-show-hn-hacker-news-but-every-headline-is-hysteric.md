# Show HN: Hacker News, but every headline is hysterical clickbait

- TL;DR  
  A playful Show HN page takes the live Hacker News front page and rewrites every title as over-the-top, hysterical clickbait (“PROGRAMMING IS OVER,” “YOUR TV IS WATCHING YOU”). It’s built via a prompt that asks an LLM to amp up drama while keeping links intact, turning the feed into a parody of engagement-driven media. Commenters laugh at how exhausting and funny it is, then pivot to serious ideas: tools to detect or tame clickbait, and how close this feels to real news feeds.

- Comment pulse  
  - Clickbaitified HN is very funny → exaggerates existing trends; users love specific lines like “Delty… You Probably Aren't Qualified” but also feel visually exhausted.  
  - We should invert this with LLMs → auto-detect and “de-bias” headlines, or use clickbait style only to highlight positive, constructive news.  
  - This parody is uncomfortably close to reality → modern feeds already optimize for outrage and urgency—counterpoint: even HN drifts in that direction sometimes.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Great demo of how trivially LLMs can turn neutral headlines into emotionally manipulative framing at scale.  
  - Impact: Could inspire both satire sites and practical “headline normalizer” tools for healthier information diets.  
  - Watch next: Browser extensions that rewrite headlines on-page; measure effects on engagement, stress, and perceived trustworthiness.
