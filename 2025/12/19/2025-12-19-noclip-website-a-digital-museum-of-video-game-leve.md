# Noclip.website – A digital museum of video game levels

- Score: 437 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46321619) | Link: https://noclip.website/

## TL;DR
noclip.website is a browser-based “digital museum” where you freely fly around ripped levels from consoles like the N64 and GameCube, revealing how classic games were actually constructed. Commenters geek out over Rare’s vertex-colored N64 worlds, Nintendo’s simple but elegant rendering pipelines, and the artistry needed to work within hardware limits. Others note rough edges: no real mobile support, strict WebGPU/WASM requirements, huge caches. Related projects like osrs.world and the creator’s deep-dive videos round out the ecosystem.

## Comment pulse
- Retro level design showcase → N64 and Nintendo levels reveal clever use of vertex colors and simple pipelines, highlighting artists' skill over raw graphical horsepower.  
- Platform gaps → Site often fails on Mobile Safari and older/alternative browsers due to WebGPU and WASM limits; author prioritizes desktop, accepts community patches.  
- Ecosystem and nostalgia → Similar projects like osrs.world map worlds; visitors use them for video b-roll and reminiscing, sparking debates over modern versus classic games.

## LLM perspective
- View: Interactive, explorable level archives turn game history into a manipulable dataset, aiding preservation, education, and reverse-engineering beyond static screenshots.  
- Impact: Most useful to graphics enthusiasts, modders, speedrunners, and researchers studying level design, rendering tricks, and spatial layouts across hardware generations.  
- Watch next: Watch for wider WebGPU adoption enabling more consoles, richer shaders, and eventually usable mobile support for interactive game-level museums.
