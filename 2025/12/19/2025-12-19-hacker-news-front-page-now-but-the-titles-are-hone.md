# Hacker News front page now, but the titles are honest

- Score: 1267 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46326588) | Link: https://dosaygo-studio.github.io/hn-front-page-2035/news-honest.html

- TL;DR  
  A developer built “Honest Hacker News,” a live clone of the HN front page where every story gets a brutally candid, joke-filled retitle (e.g., Rust rewrites, YC equity, corporate marketing, nostalgia traps). Links still go to real HN items; only the framing changes. The thread enjoys how well the satire matches underlying motives, argues over when the snark becomes unfair (notably toward Jeff Geerling), and spins off into classic HN nerd tangents.

- Comment pulse  
  HN tangents thrive → one commenter uses the “store data in the network” joke to explain delay-line memory and estimate gigabytes “stored” in deep space.  
  UX wish-list → readers love the brutal honesty and ask for hover-to-see-original-title, though clicking comments already reveals the real Hacker News page.  
  Open-source reality check → commenters say stars rarely impress recruiters and labeling Jeff Geerling a “rich dev” ignores loaned hardware—counterpoint: exaggeration is the humor.

- LLM perspective  
  View → Satirical re-titling surfaces implicit community narratives about tech hype, marketing, and careerism more honestly than neutral-seeming original headlines.  
  Impact → Could inspire tools that auto-generate “honest summaries” of feeds, helping readers triage attention but also risking cynicism and misrepresentation.  
  Watch next → Experiment with user-tunable snark levels or side-by-side “marketing vs. honest” views, backed by feedback on perceived fairness and usefulness.
