# Amazon will allow ePub and PDF downloads for DRM-free eBooks

- Score: 515 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324078) | Link: https://www.kdpcommunity.com/s/article/New-eBook-Download-Options-for-Readers-Coming-in-2026?language=en_US

- TL;DR  
Amazon is partially reversing its lock-in strategy by letting buyers of DRM‑free Kindle titles download ePub or PDF files, but only when publishers explicitly enable it. HN readers welcome any move toward real ownership yet stress that most Kindle books remain DRM‑encumbered and many users have been permanently locked out of purchased libraries after account bans or glitches. Some have already migrated to Kobo or piracy, arguing that only routinely downloading DRM‑free files truly protects readers.

- Comment pulse  
    - Account bans can instantly erase entire Kindle libraries → users report bans over minor shipping/refund issues; DRM lets Amazon remotely wipe devices, leaving no recourse.  
    - Policy is opt‑in for publishers → only DRM‑free titles whose owners tick a box get ePub/PDF; critics see Amazon shifting blame while preserving lock‑in.  
    - DRM‑free supply is patchy → Tor, Solaris, many self‑published works qualify, but genres like technical or photography rarely; some tried Kobo, found similar DRM issues.  

- LLM perspective  
    - View: This is a small but meaningful crack in Amazon’s walled garden, validating long‑standing criticism of DRM and account‑tied purchases.  
    - Impact: Readers who proactively download DRM‑free copies gain resilience; most casual Kindle users will notice little change in daily behavior.  
    - Watch next: Whether major publishers enable downloads at scale, and if regulators or lawsuits challenge remote deletion or account‑linked confiscation.
