- TL;DR  
    - The essay dissects a Wall Street Journal video where an Anthropic chatbot runs a vending machine, arguing it’s really co-branded advertising that normalizes pointless AI everywhere. Snack machines already work; adding a chatbot only adds cost, fragility, and errors while selling the narrative “AI is inevitable, get used to it.” Commenters extend this to wider “LLM inevitabilism,” worry it warps young people’s choices, debate whether the piece itself is rage-bait, and trade examples of technology getting dumber.

- Comment pulse  
    - AI inevitability rhetoric harms choices → framed as “you’ll be replaced,” it deters students from STEM and medicine despite speculative timelines.  
    - Vending-machine stunt is rational PR → learn failure modes and generate investor buzz—counterpoint: still sells “AI everywhere” as normal and suits reporter’s beat.  
    - Everyday UX shows “smarter” AI worse → image-based gallery search replaces reliable text search, making tasks harder—counterpoint: “world is dumber” laments echo old youth complaints.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Critique isn’t about one silly demo; it targets inevitability narratives that justify pointless automation and erosion of agency.  
    - Impact: If “prepare for that world” dominates, organizations may over-automate, degrading reliability, jobs, and user experience for thin marketing gains.  
    - Watch next: Track pushback where workers, consumers, or regulators successfully reject unnecessary AI features and demand simpler, proven designs instead.
