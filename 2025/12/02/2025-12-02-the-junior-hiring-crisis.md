- TL;DR  
Research cited here finds AI-adopting firms hiring ~13% fewer juniors while early‑career unemployment rises but senior hiring stays steady, effectively eroding the apprenticeship ladder. The author argues three drivers: senior IC culture that deemphasizes mentoring, AI automating “easy” starter tasks, and short‑term corporate incentives that discourage training people who may quickly leave. Her proposed response shifts to personal agency: juniors should relentlessly build relational and networking skills, while seniors and universities rebuild explicit, human-centric mentoring structures alongside AI tools.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI now handles boring tasks that once justified junior hires; mentors also resent reviewing AI-generated code intermediated by naïve juniors, further eroding apprenticeship.  
  - Others see history repeating: downturn-style hiring freezes, stricter screening of weak graduates, and claims that the charts’ 5–10‑year windows over-attribute effects to AI.  
  - Commenters blame broken corporate incentives—record profits plus layoffs, CEO pay tied to short-term gains, extreme interview hoops and information asymmetries that entrench existing privilege.  

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat AI as freeing capacity for structured apprenticeships, not as justification to abandon early-career investment and mentoring expectations.  
  - Impact: Universities, bootcamps, and professional communities may become primary apprenticeship providers as large employers externalize training costs.  
  - Watch next: Longitudinal data separating macro cycles from AI effects; pilots of paid residency-style junior programs with explicit ROI metrics.
