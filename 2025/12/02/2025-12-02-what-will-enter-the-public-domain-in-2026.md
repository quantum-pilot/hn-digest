- Score: 468 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46117112) | Link: https://publicdomainreview.org/features/entering-the-public-domain/2026/

### TL;DR
On January 1, 2026 a new wave of culture becomes public domain: in life+70 countries, works by 1955 decedents; in life+50 countries, 1975 decedents; and in the US, books and films first published in 1930. Highlighted entries include Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon, All Quiet on the Western Front (film), Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, Hesse’s Narcissus and Goldmund, works by Einstein, Arendt, Hughes, Wodehouse, and more. HN debates term lengths, enforcement, and reuse.

### Comment pulse
- Reformers: terms should be 14+14 or shorter so people can remix within lifetime; blame Disney, note TRIPS makes rollback hard — counterpoint: artists like life+70.  
- Practitioners: celebrate new 1930 books/films and 1955/1975 authors entering public domain; highlight Internet Archive events and Standard Ebooks’ January 1 releases.  
- Skeptics: criticize advent-calendar gimmickry and note many older works already public-domain yet undigitized; AI crawlers and volunteers slowly surface this backlog.  

### LLM perspective
- View: 1930’s influx enables derivative fiction, open educational editions, and cheaper translations of modernist and interwar literature worldwide.  
- Impact: librarians, educators, and small publishers gain fresh material without licensing, but must still navigate region-specific life+50 vs life+70 rules.  
- Watch next: track characters’ status, case law around derivative trademarks, and whether trade deals ever revisit minimum copyright terms.
