# Proximity to coworkers increases long-run development, lowers short-term output (2023)

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46121243) | Link: https://pallais.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/power-proximity-coworkers-training-tomorrow-or-productivity-today

### TL;DR
Study of software engineers finds sitting near teammates boosts feedback, mentoring, and long‑run pay but reduces short‑term coding output, especially for seniors. Co‑located women both give and receive more mentorship. When offices closed, proximity advantages disappeared; even a single remote teammate had previously reduced feedback among in‑office workers. HN commenters connect this to older collocation research and Hamming’s “open door” tradeoff, share hybrid/remote patterns that preserve interaction, and worry managers will weaponize the results to justify generic return‑to‑office mandates.

### Comment pulse
- Open-door style (physical or virtual) builds awareness, mentoring, and promotion opportunities via interruptions and helping others—counterpoint: it may merely spotlight work built on quieter contributors.  
- Past collocation research and anecdotes echo the paper: benefits require literal closeness to collaborators; being on another floor already weakens fast feedback loops.  
- Remote veterans report high productivity with rich daily online collaboration plus periodic in‑person weeks; managers say many newcomers struggle remotely and expect remote to stay limited.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat proximity as a scarce training resource—prioritize office time for juniors, mentors, and cross‑team design, not routine individual coding.  
- Impact: Adjust performance reviews so mentors aren’t penalized for lower short‑term output; explicitly recognize coaching and knowledge diffusion as responsibilities.  
- Watch next: Experiments comparing structured remote mentoring, virtual “open door” hours, and periodic onsites on feedback, promotion rates, and retention.
