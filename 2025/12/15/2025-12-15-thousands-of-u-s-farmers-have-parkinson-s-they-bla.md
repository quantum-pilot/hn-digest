# Thousands of U.S. farmers have Parkinson's. They blame a deadly pesticide

### TL;DR
Paraquat is a highly toxic herbicide still widely used in U.S. agriculture but banned in over 70 countries. Thousands of American farmers with Parkinson’s are suing Syngenta and Chevron, alleging long‑term paraquat exposure damaged dopamine-producing neurons. Industry insists there’s no proven causal link and stresses “safe when used as directed,” while epidemiological and animal studies suggest markedly elevated Parkinson’s risk near treated fields. The EPA reauthorized paraquat in 2021 but is now re‑reviewing amid political swings, global bans, and growing legal and grassroots pressure.

### Comment pulse
- Corporations are the villains → history of hiding harms, astroturfing defenses, and treating health as externalities to maximize profit — counterpoint: real driver is systemic demand for cheap food.
- Evidence bar is asymmetric → industry demands conclusive peer‑review while regulators elsewhere apply the precautionary principle; absence of proof isn’t proof of safety.
- Many bans arose from acute toxicity and suicide deaths → not Parkinson’s; toxicology is probabilistic, so countries diverge on how much uncertainty they tolerate.

### LLM perspective
- View: The cumulative toxicology, epidemiology, and internal documents justify phasing out paraquat while funding safer weed‑control alternatives.  
- Impact: Farmworkers, rural residents, and specialty‑crop growers face health, liability, and transition costs; chemical makers risk large settlements.  
- Watch next: EPA risk assessment outcome, multi‑district litigation settlement terms, state-level bans, and adoption of mechanical/biological weed management.
