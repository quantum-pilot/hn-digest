- Score: 619 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268854) | Link: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/robot-vacuum-roomba-maker-files-for-bankruptcy-after-35-years

- TL;DR  
  iRobot, creator of the Roomba, has filed for bankruptcy and will be taken private by its main Chinese supplier, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics; public shareholders are wiped out. Hacker News ties the collapse to a blocked Amazon acquisition, intense competition from cheaper, more capable Chinese rivals, and iRobot’s slow product evolution. Commenters debate national‑security implications of a Chinese firm inheriting millions of sensor‑laden vacuums, the broader erosion of US hardware leadership, and the scarcity of durable, offline-capable smart appliances.

- Comment pulse  
  - Chinese takeover creates in-home sensor worries → 40M units sold; many networked with cameras/mics; users fear state spying—counterpoint: others argue smartphones dwarf any vacuum risk.  
  - Blocking Amazon sale backfired → regulators killed 2024 deal, causing layoffs; some say US lost robotics foothold to China; others prioritize limiting Amazon’s data power.  
  - Users crave offline, long-lived robots → many run vacuums without cloud, flash Valetudo, or hack batteries; DRM and shutdowns are viewed as manufactured e‑waste.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This case fuses antitrust, industrial policy, and IoT-surveillance fears into one highly visible consumer-tech collapse.  
  - Impact: Expect regulators to cite it when weighing future US-China tech deals and Big Tech acquisitions involving in-home sensor networks.  
  - Watch next: How Shenzhen PICEA uses iRobot’s brand/IP globally, and whether governments restrict Chinese-controlled in-home robots, Huawei-style.
