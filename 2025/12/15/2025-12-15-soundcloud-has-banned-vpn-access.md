# SoundCloud has banned VPN access

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46269891) | Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/SoundCloudMusic/comments/1pltd19/soundcloud_just_banned_vpn_access/

- TL;DR  
SoundCloud appears to be broadly blocking connections from known VPN/proxy IP ranges, affecting even long-time paying users. The move is seen as an anti-abuse, licensing, or anti-scraping measure, but relies on imperfect VPN-detection databases that routinely cause collateral damage. Commenters explain that commercial VPN endpoints are surprisingly easy to enumerate and block, yet determined attackers can still bypass such defenses. Many worry this is part of a broader trend of the web turning hostile to privacy-conscious, legitimate users.

- Comment pulse  
  - Blocking via VPN/proxy databases is now routine → providers map most commercial exit IPs; easier to overblock than miss abusive traffic.  
  - Users wanting anonymity feel squeezed → widespread IP/ASN blocking hits privacy tools and personal VPNs, while serious attackers still bypass defenses.  
  - Paying SoundCloud subscribers on VPNs threaten to leave → some openly consider piracy rather than exposing home IPs or reconfiguring setups.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: VPN blocking is a blunt but cheap control; incentives favor it until churn and bad press outweigh bot-scraping or licensing risks.  
  - Impact: Privacy-conscious users, travelers, and corporate networks get locked out first; small creators lose audience despite not driving these policies.  
  - Watch next: clearer AUPs around VPNs, region locks tied to identity verification, and workarounds like residential VPNs and protocol obfuscation.
