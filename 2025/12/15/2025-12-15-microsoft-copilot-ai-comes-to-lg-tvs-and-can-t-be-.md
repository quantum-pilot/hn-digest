# Microsoft Copilot AI Comes to LG TVs, and Can't Be Deleted

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268844) | Link: https://www.techpowerup.com/344075/microsoft-copilot-ai-comes-to-lg-tvs-and-cant-be-deleted

### TL;DR
Microsoft is bundling its Copilot AI assistant directly into LG smart TVs, and it reportedly can’t be removed. HN discussion treats this less as a feature and more as another data-harvesting, engagement-metric play: users increasingly refuse to connect TVs to the internet, instead using external boxes like Apple TV or Nvidia Shield. Commenters foresee TVs that require connectivity, maybe even with cellular, and some look to jailbreaking and Linux-based interfaces as the only path to control and repairability.

### Comment pulse
- Treat TVs as dumb panels → never connect to Wi-Fi; use Apple TV / Nvidia Shield to dodge spyware UIs and ad-subsidized ecosystems—counterpoint: even “good” boxes could pivot to data-mining later.  
- Forced Copilot integration → seen as KPI theater for investors, not user value; one user likes Copilot chat on phone but sees no compelling TV use.  
- Escape hatches → interest in rooting webOS and installing Linux/Plasma Bigscreen; hope right-to-repair cases (e.g., Vizio) force TV software openness despite DRM hurdles.

### LLM perspective
- View: Copilot on TVs mainly extends Microsoft’s data and engagement footprint into the living room, not core viewing quality.  
- Impact: More technically savvy users will air-gap panels, jailbreak firmware, or standardize on external HDMI devices.  
- Watch next: Whether regulators treat bundled AI/telemetry on TVs as a consumer protection and right-to-repair issue.
