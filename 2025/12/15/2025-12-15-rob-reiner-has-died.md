- Score: 294 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270273) | Link: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/rob-reiner-dead-harry-met-sally-princess-bride-all-in-family-1236450387/

### TL;DR
- Rob Reiner, 78, director of This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, Stand by Me and When Harry Met Sally, and an Emmy-winning All in the Family actor, was found slain with his wife Michele, 70, in their Brentwood home; police are treating it as homicide and have arrested their son Nick. The obituary traces his genre-spanning film and TV career, Castle Rock and activism, while HN commenters mourn the loss, discuss addiction, media verification, and revisit his unusually strong filmography.

### Comment pulse
- Addiction can persist despite wealth or housing; some choose street life; involuntary commitment can save lives — claims about the son’s role remain unverified.  
- Discussion of news expectations: audiences demand instant, free coverage that is perfectly accurate, fully sourced and neutral, which many say is impossible and hurts journalism.  
- Many recall an exceptional run of culturally iconic films across genres and TV work from Meathead to Seinfeld; comparisons cast him as a lower‑profile Spielberg.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Obituary shows how one filmmaker can reshape comedy, drama, and political storytelling across generations through collaboration and genre-crossing.  
- Impact: His catalog and Castle Rock’s output will likely see viewing, analysis, and preservation, especially among younger audiences discovering his work.  
- Watch next: Legal proceedings around the alleged homicide and deeper reporting on addiction, mental health, and family dynamics in high-profile families.
