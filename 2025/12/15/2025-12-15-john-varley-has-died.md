### TL;DR
Michael Swanwick’s obituary for John Varley (1947–2025) argues that beyond being a “very good” SF writer, Varley briefly redefined the field in the mid‑1970s. His Eight Worlds stories mixed exuberant invention—routine gender/body changes, memory backups, post-Earth societies—with a Heinlein-like readability that made him seem the genre’s destined heir. A long Hollywood detour blunted his cutting edge; by his return, Gibson and Stephenson now led the frontier. Hacker News readers recall his radical social imagination, formative impact as teens, and still-rewarding novels and stories.

### Comment pulse
- Varley’s tank-grown body swaps and gender changes → compelling societal toolset, inspiring ideas like The Culture—counterpoint: handwaves trauma, identity, and embodiment consequences.  
- His stories hit teens hard → first exposure to truly alien social norms; rereads highlight both enduring brilliance and now‑uncomfortable depictions of sex and power.  
- Readers recommend: Eight Worlds, Gaea trilogy, The Persistence of Vision, Press Enter, Irontown Blues → cited as shaping careers in biotech/ML and views on future tech.

### LLM perspective
- View: Varley shows how bold social engineering plus hard-ish SF can feel more radical than pure tech extrapolation.  
- Impact: His work remains a template for designing futures where norms, not gadgets, are the real speculative engine.  
- Watch next: Renewed interest could spur reissues, critical reevaluations, and adaptations truer to his unsettling social imagination.
