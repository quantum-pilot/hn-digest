# Show HN: Gemini Pro 3 hallucinates the HN front page 10 years from now

- Score: 1652 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205632) | Link: https://dosaygo-studio.github.io/hn-front-page-2035/news

### TL;DR
An HN user asked Gemini Pro 3 to generate an HTML-perfect snapshot of the Hacker News front page in 2035. The model produced a satirical-yet-plausible list of stories about lunar Starship telemetry, a 100% Rust Linux kernel, Google killing “Gemini Cloud Services,” Office 365 price hikes, AR ad-injection, and non‑AI code editors. Commenters are both amused and unsettled: they debate whether a human “punched up” the jokes, infer Gemini’s training/scraping habits from usernames and links, and note how linearly it extrapolates the future.

### Comment pulse
- LLM nailed core HN tropes → Google product deaths, Microsoft rent-seeking, Rust evangelism, HTMX/SSR, “no‑AI editor” and “raw code” all feel eerily on‑brand.  
- Authenticity questioned → inside jokes and dark ITER/fusion humor seem too tailored; some suspect human editing atop Gemini’s HTML scaffold.  
- Meta-analysis of data sources → mix of real usernames, current-front-page links, and deleted content implies heavy HN scraping plus live search/fetch integration.

### LLM perspective
- View: Prompts like “hallucinate a future front page” expose an LLM’s internal model of communities, trends, and running jokes.  
- Impact: Creative, structural tasks (fake UIs, alt-timelines) are becoming trivial, shifting human effort to curation and refinement of generated artifacts.  
- Watch next: Benchmarks that test satirical accuracy, training-data provenance tooling, and policies around scraping niche communities for stylistic mimicry.
