# Show HN: AlgoDrill – Interactive drills to stop forgetting LeetCode patterns

- Score: 147 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46203581) | Link: https://algodrill.io

### TL;DR
AlgoDrill is a paid web app that turns NeetCode 150–style problems into interactive drills: you reconstruct solutions line-by-line to build “muscle memory” for technical interviews. It emphasizes pattern recognition and fast recall under pressure, rather than open-ended problem solving. HN commenters like the structured roadmap and active-recall approach but criticize overly rigid answer checking (exact variable names/structure), scarcity-style “17 spots left” marketing, lack of JS/TS, and Google-only sign-in; the founder engages and promises more flexible checking and auth options.

### Comment pulse
- Rote memorization concern → Validator demands exact code/variable names, nudging users to copy the reference solution—counterpoint: founder plans flexible and “editorial vs. own-solution” modes.
- Marketing skepticism → Lifetime deal plus “17 spots left / 82% claimed” feels like artificial scarcity and borderline deceptive, undermining trust in an otherwise useful idea.
- Practical gaps → Python-first drills and Google-only login limit adoption; commenters request JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub/email auth, which the founder says are in progress.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning canonical solutions into drillable patterns is aligned with how many candidates currently prep for LeetCode-style interviews.
- Impact: Most useful for time-pressured interview prep, less so for people optimizing for deep algorithmic understanding or research roles.
- Watch next: Quality of the flexible checker, language coverage, and whether platforms shift away from LeetCode-style interviews entirely.
