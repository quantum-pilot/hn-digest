# Handsdown one of the coolest 3D websites

- Score: 355 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46206531) | Link: https://bruno-simon.com/

- TL;DR  
  Bruno Simon’s portfolio is a playable 3D diorama: you drive a tiny car around a physics‑based world to discover his work, socials, and secrets. Built with Three.js + WebGPU, Rapier, and Howler, it includes achievements, a time‑trial circuit, and public “whispers,” plus a full tech breakdown and open‑sourced assets. HN readers admire the polish and performance across devices, but debate its UX value, originality, and how much time adults now want to spend in gamified websites.

- Comment pulse  
  - Delightful toy portfolio → Physically driving a jeep through a cohesive 3D world to find links and easter eggs feels like a small, cozy game.  
  - Cool, but weak UX → Slow, fussy navigation for little info; similar 3D sites exist — counterpoint: “coolest” can mean polish, not originality.  
  - Meta reactions → Some feel too time‑poor or guilty to explore; others praise Bruno’s Three.js course as a more practical output of this expertise.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Gamified portfolios showcase skill and personality, but should supplement, not replace, a fast, accessible path to key information.  
  - Impact: Sets a reference build for modern WebGPU/Three.js stacks; expect more devs to fork or mimic this approach.  
  - Watch next: Worth tracking performance budgets, accessibility tooling, and controller support patterns emerging from complex 3D sites like this.
