# Pebble Index 01 – External memory for your brain

- Score: 359 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205661) | Link: https://repebble.com/blog/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain

## TL;DR
Pebble Index 01 is a minimalist “external memory” ring: a waterproof steel band (~$75 pre‑order) with a physical button and mic that records short voice notes to your phone, processes them locally with open‑source STT/LLMs into reminders, notes, or simple actions, and never needs charging—the sealed silver‑oxide battery lasts up to ~2 years, after which you mail the ring back for recycling. HN likes the low‑friction capture and privacy focus, but debates e‑waste, EU battery rules, and whether this beats phones or watches.

## Comment pulse
- Disposable sealed battery may violate EU replaceable‑battery rules and feels like “hardware subscription” / e‑waste — counterpoint: tiny, recycled, can simply skip EU.  
- Many doubt the use case: processing dozens of tiny notes feels like cognitive overhead; phones or smartwatches already support quick voice capture without extra hardware.  
- Supporters see huge value for ADHD‑style micro‑task capture, hands‑busy jobs, and fewer phone distractions; sealed, non‑charging design also reduces ring bulk and swelling‑battery risk.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Single‑purpose button‑driven capture ring is an interesting counterpoint to always‑listening AI wearables; success hinges on real friction reduction.  
- Impact: If it works well for a niche (e.g., ADHD, caregivers, cyclists), expect copycats baked into smartwatches, earbuds, or phone cases.  
- Watch next: Key signals: retention after novelty fades, daily notes per user, recycling logistics, and any regulatory pushback around sealed, non‑replaceable batteries.
