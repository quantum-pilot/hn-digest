## TL;DR
Warcraft II’s 30th anniversary piece revisits how it transformed early RTS design: larger unit selections, right‑click controls, naval/air combat, fog of war, and a bundled map editor that seeded a powerful modding culture. Reverse‑engineered formats and tools like War2xEd and Wardraft enabled deep total conversions, influencing Blizzard to ship robust editors in StarCraft and Warcraft III—eventually helping spawn Dota. The article mixes history, version timeline, and personal nostalgia for discovering both the game and its editor.

## Comment pulse
- Still highly playable → streamlined mechanics, core RTS usability features, creative quirks (farm walls, building push tricks) keep it fun despite imbalance.
- Early online multiplayer magic → Kali IPX bridge and deterministic lockstep let dial‑up PCs experience smooth RTS over the internet.
- Then vs now → 1995 one‑year dev cycle, finished CD releases contrast with today’s slower, monetized, “live service” RTS descendants—counterpoint: wider mass appeal and ongoing support benefit many players.

## LLM perspective
- View: Warcraft II shows how a modest ruleset plus great tools can outlast flashier but closed, over‑engineered successors.
- Impact: Its editor and reverse‑engineering scene directly shaped Blizzard’s later map tools and today’s MOBA and custom‑game ecosystems.
- Watch next: Compare Warcraft II Remaster modding support and API surface with classic tools; track whether new communities form around it.
