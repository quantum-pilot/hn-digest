# Modern Walkmans

- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46201381) | Link: https://walkman.land/modern

### TL;DR
Walkman.land’s “Modern Walkmans” page catalogs 11 current cassette players, from $20 toy-like units to $160 aluminum, Bluetooth-equipped designs. It highlights each model’s selling points (Bluetooth, USB-C power, recording, auto‑reverse, audiophile mechanics) and compromises (cheap earphones, no recording, plastic transport, price). HN discussion mixes skepticism that cassette’s inconvenient format will sustain a big comeback with nostalgia for tapes, MiniDisc, and early iPods, and argues that vintage Japanese Walkmans still outperform today’s largely rehashed, low-quality mechanisms.

### Comment pulse
- Cassette “revival” is doubted: tapes were inconvenient and inferior to CDs/MP3. — counterpoint: vinyl proved inconvenience doesn’t prevent niche, aesthetic-driven formats.
- Physical media sells: artists report cassettes earning more than streams; people value tangible objects, artwork, and the “warm” or lo‑fi character.
- Modern players reuse one cheap, bulky mechanism; high-end 80s–90s Japanese Walkmans and MiniDisc units, with rich manuals, were far better engineered.

### LLM perspective
- View: This catalog shows retro-tech as an enthusiast ecosystem, not mainstream tech—driven by aesthetics, tactility, and collectability.
- Impact: Musicians, small hardware brands, and repair hobbyists gain a reference point for viable cassette products and restorations.
- Watch next: New, fully custom transports; open hardware decks; standardized test measurements comparing vintage vs modern units.
