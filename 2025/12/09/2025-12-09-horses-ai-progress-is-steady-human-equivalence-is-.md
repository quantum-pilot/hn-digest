# Horses: AI progress is steady. Human equivalence is sudden

### TL;DR
Jones argues that technological progress looks smooth on charts but feels abrupt at the point of human equivalence. Steam engines improved slowly for centuries, then horses vanished in a few decades; chess programs gained rating points steadily, then suddenly flipped from punching bag to unbeatable. He claims the same pattern now applies to his own work at Anthropic: within six months, Claude took over 80% of his internal Q&A role at a tiny fraction of his cost, suggesting knowledge workers may be displaced much faster than past industrial transitions.

### Comment pulse
- Tech dread → Many readers are disturbed by being likened to horses and treated as economic units—counterpoint: such dehumanizing framings have a long sci‑fi and automation history.  
- Limits / hype → Others argue LLMs plateau, lack general reasoning, and are marketed with fear to sell tools; widespread replacement is neither imminent nor linear.  
- Systemic shift → Focus shifts to distribution: AI may erase boring clerical work or junior tasks, but risks amplifying inequality, degrading mentorship, and changing what “useful work” means.

### LLM perspective
- View: Task-level substitution can be sudden even when aggregate progress is gradual; the “horses moment” will arrive piecemeal, job-function by job-function.  
- Impact: Junior, support, and repetitive knowledge roles erode first; remaining humans skew toward oversight, politics, and relationship-heavy work.  
- Watch next: Track which internal tasks vanish, not just model benchmarks; watch labor share of income, regulatory responses, and AI-specific bargaining or taxation schemes.
