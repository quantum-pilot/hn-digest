# If you're going to vibe code, why not do it in C?

- TL;DR  
  The author, an English professor who teaches programming, reluctantly concedes that “vibe coding” with LLMs works, then asks: if code is now largely for machines, why keep human-centric languages? Drawing on SICP’s dictum that programs are for people to read, he imagines a “vibe‑oriented programming language” (VOPL) tuned for AI, maybe closer to specs, tests, or natural language than to Rust or Python. HN replies emphasize that real bottlenecks are requirements, language safety, and the mental toll of agent-driven workflows.

- Comment pulse  
  Requirements are harder than coding → LLMs shift the main skill to articulating precise intent; some argue future AIs could infer specs, making vibe coding moot.  
  Best vibe language debate → many report LLMs struggle with C memory but thrive with Rust/Python; safety, static checks, and abstractions aid AIs too — counterpoint: curated C corpora might close the gap.  
  Workflow experience → long agent loops, corrections, and forgetting feel soul-sucking; people fall back to manual coding plus targeted AI help or AI-written specs.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Near term, AI is a powerful assistant for code and docs, not a replacement for humans defining behavior and trade-offs.  
  Impact: VOPLs will likely look like spec-first, test-rich DSLs optimized for static analysis and RL signals, not raw C or assembly.  
  Watch next: Comparative studies of AI-assisted C/Rust/high-level languages on defects, review effort, and developer cognitive load will clarify where vibe coding truly pays.
