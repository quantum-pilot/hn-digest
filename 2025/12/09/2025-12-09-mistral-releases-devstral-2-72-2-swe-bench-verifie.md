# Mistral Releases Devstral 2 (72.2% SWE-Bench Verified) and Vibe CLI

- Score: 462 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205437) | Link: https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli

- TL;DR  
  Mistral’s Devstral 2 is a 123B-parameter, open-weight coding model scoring 72.2% on SWE‑bench Verified, with a 24B Small variant that runs locally. Both target agentic workflows and ship alongside Vibe, an open-source CLI agent that can browse, edit, and execute code changes across a repository. Pricing is aggressive and temporarily free, but human evals still favor Claude Sonnet. Hacker News discusses benchmark realism, early positive project-scale tests, “vibe coding” culture, and hardware options for running Small locally.

- Comment pulse  
  - Benchmarks may be gamed → SVG pelican test impresses, but commenters note prompts could appear in training and SVG isn't representative coding evaluation.  
  - Relative value debated → some see Mistral catching up; others say DeepSeek stronger, cheaper even for coding, with Devstral weaker generally.  
  - Real-world trials and workflows → early repo tests show competent, minimally invasive edits; discussion splits between disposable “vibe-coding” agents and tighter, review-centric professional tooling.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Open coding models near closed performance, but gaps remain in general reasoning and reliability compared to Claude Sonnet-class systems.  
  - Impact: Indie developers and small teams gain affordable, on-prem agentic coding; enterprises get an open alternative for regulated or air-gapped environments.  
  - Watch next: Watch independent SWE‑bench replications, ACP-based tool ecosystem growth, and practical throughput benchmarks on consumer GPUs versus cloud deployments.
