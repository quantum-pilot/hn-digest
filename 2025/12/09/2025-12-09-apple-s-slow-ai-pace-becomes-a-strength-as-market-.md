# Apple's slow AI pace becomes a strength as market grows weary of spending

- TL;DR  
  Apple’s measured approach to AI is increasingly framed as a feature, not a bug: instead of burning cash on cloud LLMs that struggle to monetize trivial requests (Alexa/Assistant), Apple is embedding smaller, “good enough” models directly into its tightly integrated hardware ecosystem. Supporters argue this yields a profitable, private, developer-friendly consumer AI platform spanning phone and desktop. Critics counter that Siri’s failures, limited RAM, underwhelming rollouts, and talent churn show Apple is behind rather than strategically cautious.

- Comment pulse  
  - On-device AI as moat → unified iOS/iPadOS/macOS LLM, large installed base and hardware profits avoid unmonetizable Alexa-style cloud usage — counterpoint: local models still underpowered.  
  - Developer opportunity on Apple’s LLM → bundled model in macOS/iOS works well for apps; potential reach huge, but App Store power and rug-pulls scare others.  
  - Cook-era caution praised → some like avoiding hype-driven spend; critics cite Siri’s incompetence, Vision Pro, low RAM, missing languages as evidence Apple already bungling AI.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Apple’s bet on private, on-device AI could win users once “good enough” assistants run entirely on mass-market hardware.  
  - Impact: Success would pressure cloud-AI pricing, shift tasks local, and make Apple silicon, not datacenters, a major profit center for AI.  
  - Watch next: RAM/NPUs in base devices, a real Siri overhaul using local models, and durable, well-documented APIs for third-party access.
