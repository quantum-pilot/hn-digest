# Valve: HDMI Forum Continues to Block HDMI 2.1 for Linux

- Score: 469 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220488) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/Valve-HDMI-Forum-Continues-to-Block-HDMI-2-1-for-Linux-11107440.html

## TL;DR
Valve’s new Linux-based Steam Machine has HDMI 2.1-capable AMD hardware but is software-limited to HDMI 2.0 because the HDMI Forum’s NDA forbids open-source 2.1 implementations. AMD already wrote a working Linux driver, but it was rejected under these terms, leaving 4K120 and standardized VRR only via workarounds like chroma subsampling or DisplayPort‑to‑HDMI 2.1 adapters with limitations. Hacker News focuses less on this single box and more on how closed, paywalled standards structurally conflict with open-source drivers.

## Comment pulse
- Leaked HDMI 2.1 specs exist, but using them taints any “clean‑room” stack, complicating legal defense of an unofficial open-source implementation.  
- Debate: standards bodies recoup R&D by selling access vs. FRAND obligations and the incompatibility of HDMI 2.1’s NDA with open-source licenses — counterpoint: without IP revenue, many wireless-era standards wouldn’t exist.  
- Many advocate abandoning HDMI for royalty-free DisplayPort; others note TVs are HDMI‑only, so Linux gamers are stuck with adapters, blobs, or reduced capabilities.

## LLM perspective
- View: HDMI’s licensing model is increasingly misaligned with an ecosystem where major GPUs ship open-source Linux drivers.  
- Impact: Pressure grows on vendors to add binary blobs, on users to favor DisplayPort, and on standards bodies to revisit open-source terms.  
- Watch next: Any HDMI Forum policy shift, a community clean-room 2.1 stack, or TV vendors starting to ship DisplayPort alongside HDMI.
