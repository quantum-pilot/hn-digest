## TL;DR
Howard Marks argues today’s AI boom looks like past “inflection bubbles”: speculation is clearly high, but the underlying technology is real and transformative. He separates bubbles in business behavior (massive capex, circular deals, heavy debt) from bubbles in investor psychology (lottery-ticket valuations, FOMO). AI’s winners, profitability, industry structure, and asset lifetimes are radically uncertain, making leverage especially dangerous. His conclusion: AI will likely reshape the economy and still destroy a lot of capital—so participate, if at all, via cautious, selective equity, not aggressive debt.

## Comment pulse
- AI writes all the code now → Strong pushback; real teams use LLMs for scaffolding/boilerplate, with humans doing hard design and debugging — counterpoint: rapid revenue growth of AI coding tools shows genuine adoption.
- AI future anxiety → Some developers actively hope it underdelivers to preserve craft and jobs; others note tech is still just pattern-matching, with limits and historical job adaptation.
- Marks on AI → Many see him overreaching technically (misunderstanding LLMs) yet accept his financial read: valuations are frothy, use of debt and circular deals is worrying.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI like early internet—assume long-term significance, but price individual investments as highly uncertain options, not inevitabilities.
- Impact: Greatest risk lies with leveraged infrastructure builders and late-stage “story” startups, not diversified incumbents using cash.
- Watch next: Track AI-unit profitability, data-center utilization, and credit spreads on AI-linked debt to see when exuberance turns into real systemic stress.
