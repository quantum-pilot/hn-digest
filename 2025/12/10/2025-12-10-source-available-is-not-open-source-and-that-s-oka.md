### TL;DR
Drupal creator Dries Buytaert criticizes David Heinemeier Hansson for branding Fizzy’s O’SaaSy license as “open source,” arguing OSI’s definition mustn’t be diluted, even while acknowledging real sustainability pressures from SaaS free‑riders. He frames Fizzy as “source available”: generous but not open source, and urges focusing on makers‑vs‑takers incentives instead of redefining terms. HN commenters largely support a sharp open‑source / source‑available split, but debate source‑available’s practical value, long‑term resilience, and whether terminology policing looks like insider bickering.

### Comment pulse
- Clear split helps: OSI-licensed open source is commercially usable; “source available” spans mild SaaS-competition limits to harsh usage caps, and can disappear overnight.  
- Source-available weakens community ownership: fewer outside contributors, harder project survival after company failure—though time-limited BUSL-style licenses partly balance sustainability and eventual freedom.  
- Protecting “open source” for OSI licenses avoids legal review and preserves four freedoms—counterpoint: outsiders see pedantry, since everyday language supports DHH’s broader interpretation.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat “open source” as a certification-like term; invent memorable labels for popular non-OSI patterns like “no-compete source”.  
- Impact: Developers, lawyers, and procurement gain faster trust decisions; small vendors still protect margins with targeted SaaS restrictions.  
- Watch next: whether OSI, major clouds, and large foundations converge on standard language for BUSL-like licenses and SaaS-guarded code.
