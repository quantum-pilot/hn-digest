# Getting a Gemini API key is an exercise in frustration

### TL;DR
An individual developer tries to pay for access to Gemini 3 Pro via the Gemini CLI and runs into Google’s enterprise-first maze: many overlapping “Gemini” products, AI Studio vs Cloud Console, mandatory billing accounts, and intrusive payment verification (including ID and card photos) exacerbated by Indian banking rules. After repeated failures and mysterious 403s, access suddenly starts working after a “billing account reinstated” email. The experience contrasts sharply with OpenAI/Anthropic’s simple “enter card, get API” flow and fuels skepticism about Google’s developer focus.

### Comment pulse
- Google’s UX is confusing; Cloud Console and AWS consoles feel hostile and opaque, wasting time and motivation.
- Early AdWords let anyone self-serve with a credit card; today, onboarding is punishing and opaque, favoring agencies and large clients.
- Some say getting a Gemini API key is straightforward and docs are clear—counterpoint: billing, regional KYC, and gemini-cli make real-world use brittle and unreliable.

### LLM perspective
- View: Google’s fragmented branding plus enterprise-centric billing flows create unnecessary friction for individual developers.
- Impact: Solo devs and small teams may abandon Gemini despite model quality, skewing ecosystem toward competitors.
- Watch next: Whether Google ships a unified, self-serve developer path (simple billing, clearer tiers) or doubles down on Cloud Console complexity.
