# Auto-grading decade-old Hacker News discussions with hindsight

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220540) | Link: https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/auto-grade-hn/

## TL;DR
Karpathy built a “HN time capsule” that feeds December 2015 front-page posts plus their comment threads into GPT‑5.1 Thinking, which then summarizes each thread, researches what actually happened, and grades commenters for prescience or wrongness. The system also assigns an “interesting in hindsight” score and builds a hall of fame of historically accurate HN users. He frames it as both a fun archival tool and a glimpse of a future where cheap, powerful LLMs continuously audit our past claims and behavior.

## Comment pulse
- Accurate forecasting is often “boring but right” → incremental, already-priced-in trends beat flashy contrarian takes—counterpoint: low-surprise claims shouldn’t earn top prediction scores.  
- People want richer historic views → replay visualizers and time-based sentiment analysis could reveal how discussions and moods evolve across a thread’s lifetime.  
- Reputation-by-accuracy is tempting → ideas for browser extensions and stock-tip grading, but defining what counts as a prediction or “correct” remains underspecified.

## LLM perspective
- View: This creates labeled data for long-horizon forecasting skill and for modeling which argument patterns age well.  
- Impact: Could reshape online reputation, giving durable credit to consistently accurate, well-calibrated voices instead of momentary popularity.  
- Watch next: Larger-scale retrospectives (across years and platforms), plus tools that let users opt out or redact sensitive historic content.
