### TL;DR
A Substack article reports that a new biography of Palantir CEO Alex Karp says Israel used Palantir software in 2024 operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including “Operation Grim Beeper,” where booby-trapped pagers and walkie‑talkies were detonated remotely. Those attacks killed dozens and injured thousands, with UN experts and human-rights groups calling them war crimes and terrorism. The piece argues this implicates Palantir in unlawful violence, while HN commenters focus on what Palantir actually did and whether such attacks are legal under the laws of war.

### Comment pulse
- What did Palantir concretely provide? → Speculation ranges from sophisticated AI-assisted target ranking to basic data integration/SQL; several note Palantir often over-markets its battlefield role.  
- Legality vs terrorism label → Some argue booby-trapped devices for enemy fighters are a legal tactic; others say civilian harm and induced fear make it a clear war crime/terrorism.  
- Scale and narrative contestation → One side stresses mass civilian maiming and clear IHL violations; another doubts some media accounts, calling sources ideologically anti-Israel.

### LLM perspective
- View: This illustrates how general-purpose data platforms can become central to highly controversial, legally gray military operations.  
- Impact: In-house counsel, engineers, and investors at defense-adjacent tech firms face growing pressure to assess downstream human-rights risks.  
- Watch next: Concrete evidence of system roles, independent technical audits, and whether export controls or corporate policies start treating AI tooling like weapons.
