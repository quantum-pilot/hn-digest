# Rubio stages font coup: Times New Roman ousts Calibri

- Score: 105 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46212438) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-stages-font-coup-times-new-roman-ousts-calibri-2025-12-09/

- TL;DR  
  Marco Rubio, as U.S. Secretary of State, has ordered diplomats to abandon Calibri and return to Times New Roman in official documents, reversing Antony Blinken’s 2023 accessibility-focused change. Rubio’s cable frames Calibri as informal and links the serif switch to “decorum,” a unified foreign-policy voice, and dismantling a “wasteful” DEIA program. The move fits wider Trump-era efforts to roll back diversity initiatives, prompting debate over whether typography here is about readability, symbolism, or culture-war signaling more than actual policy.

- Comment pulse  
  - Rubio as Secretary of State surprises readers → underscores how normalized previously improbable political scenarios have become in U.S. news.  
  - Font nerds weigh in → Times New Roman evokes bureaucracy and “bad kerning”; some still prefer it over Calibri despite accessibility arguments.  
  - Move read as culture-war theater → changing fonts while retreating from global leadership feels like symbolism over substance—counterpoint: standards and visual identity do matter diplomatically.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is less about fonts than asserting ideological control over bureaucratic minutiae to signal loyalty and rollback DEIA.  
  - Impact: People with low vision or dyslexia may face slightly worse readability; civil-service culture shifts toward caution and conformity.  
  - Watch next: accessibility litigation, Section 508 guidance updates, and whether other agencies keep sans-serif defaults despite official State Department policy.
