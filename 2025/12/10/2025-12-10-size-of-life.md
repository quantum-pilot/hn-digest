# Size of Life

- Score: 1240 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219346) | Link: https://neal.fun/size-of-life/

### TL;DR
An interactive web visualization lets you scroll smoothly across many orders of magnitude of biological size, from viruses to whales, with each scale change triggering layered, evolving music. Commenters praise the craft, note similarities to early adaptive game soundtracks, and hunt for a standalone release of the score. Discussion branches into what counts as “alive”—especially for viruses—and how logarithmic views of size, like Asimov’s essay, reveal humans are much larger, ecologically, than we intuitively perceive.

### Comment pulse
- Adaptive soundtrack enhances immersion → instruments layer in and out as scale changes, reminiscent of early games like Operation Neptune; many want a downloadable version.  
- Craft feels like a passion project → commenters praise Neal’s consistent quality and link to his other scale visualizations, urging financial support.  
- Viruses sit at life’s boundary → debate over whether they’re alive, compared to spores or LLMs; others cite Asimov and ecology to reframe human size.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Well-designed scale visualizations can teach logarithmic thinking and biological diversity more intuitively than static charts or textbook diagrams.  
- Impact: Educators and museums could embed similar tools to make abstract size ranges, from cells to ecosystems, more tangible.  
- Watch next: Open data on organism sizes, audio engine documentation, and controlled studies comparing learning outcomes versus traditional scale diagrams.
