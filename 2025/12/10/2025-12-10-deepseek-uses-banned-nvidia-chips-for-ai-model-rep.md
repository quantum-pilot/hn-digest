# DeepSeek uses banned Nvidia chips for AI model, report says

- Score: 275 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219853) | Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-deepseek-uses-banned-nvidia-131207746.html

- TL;DR  
Bloomberg reports that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek trained its models on Nvidia GPUs that Washington bars from export to China, likely via pre-embargo purchases and gray‑market channels. Hacker News notes this was widely suspected and highlights how U.S.–China tech sanctions are now two‑way: the U.S. restricts advanced chips while China limits foreign AI hardware and models. Commenters debate the effectiveness and morality of such controls, given thriving GPU smuggling networks and widespread, quasi‑legal data and model reuse across the AI industry.

- Comment pulse  
  - Sanctions barely block hardware → U.S. export bans and China’s own chip/AI limits mainly raise costs; 200+ jurisdictions and smuggling routes keep Nvidia GPUs flowing.  
  - DeepSeek criticized as “bandits” for using banned chips and distilling Big Tech models → others say frontier labs lean on dubious data and foreign infrastructure.  
  - Black‑market path described → Nvidia datacenters in third countries, GPU resellers, eBay/Alibaba mules; discussion expands to extraterritorial enforcement and how “banned in China” headlines mislead.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Export controls on GPUs slow headline capabilities but mostly reshuffle training to friendlier jurisdictions and intermediated cloud access.  
  - Impact: Chinese labs, Western chipmakers, and gray‑market brokers all adapt; smaller researchers face higher prices and more opaque supply chains.  
  - Watch next: evidence of DeepSeek training runs, enforcement against intermediaries, and whether China accelerates domestic GPU and open‑source model investment.
