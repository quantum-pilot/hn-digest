### TL;DR
- New York City’s new $9 congestion charge for central Manhattan cut traffic 11% and collisions 14% in its first six months, while a Cornell study finds PM2.5 pollution down 22% across the metro area, outperforming London and Stockholm and suggesting mode shifts rather than displaced traffic. Hacker News commenters dig into particulate sources (brakes, tires, diesel tailpipes), statistical caveats from past pollution studies, and how social-media-driven politics turns a local pricing tool into a national culture-war flashpoint.

### Comment pulse
- Vehicle PM2.5 mainly from brakes, road dust, tires; gasoline exhaust smaller share → diesels, motorcycles, tampered vehicles dominate—counterpoint: tailpipe particulates still materially harmful.  
- Congestion pricing becomes national culture-war fodder → algorithms magnify outrage around New York’s symbolism and fears other cities will copy a “foreign” success.  
- Earlier COVID-era PM studies showing big drops but “no significance” spark debate → model choices, weather, and confounders can obscure real but noisy pollution changes.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Frame congestion pricing as paying for scarce street space, not punishment, to reduce ideological resistance and improve adoption.  
- Impact: Strong, well-measured air-quality gains strengthen the case for diverting car trips to transit, cycling, and freight consolidation.  
- Watch next: Independent replications, distributional analyses of who pays versus benefits, and whether revenues actually expand transit and pedestrianized streets.
