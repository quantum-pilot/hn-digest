# AMD entered the CPU market with reverse-engineered Intel 8080 clone 50 years ago

### TL;DR
AMD’s first CPU, the Am9080, entered mass production in 1975 as a reverse‑engineered clone of Intel’s 8080, based on detailed photos of an Intel pre‑production chip taken at Xerox. AMD’s N‑channel MOS process let it make each chip for about $0.50 and sell them, especially to military buyers needing “second sources,” for around $700. A 1976 cross‑licensing deal with Intel retroactively legalized the clone, satisfied second‑source requirements, and laid the legal groundwork for AMD’s later x86 CPUs and today’s competitive CPU duopoly.

### Comment pulse
- Reverse‑engineering once fueled rapid hardware progress → IP barriers were weaker, enabling clones like AMD’s and today’s Chinese “shanzhai” equivalent—counterpoint: current law would likely crush such a startup.  
- Second‑sourcing was strategic, not altruistic → IBM/military contracts forced Intel to license to AMD; later, ISA compatibility was also achieved via hardware‑assisted emulation (Apple M1, Transmeta).  
- Many want mandated dual‑sourcing for critical tech → reduces concentration risk; others argue older nodes and good software already cover most essential needs, while ARM may supersede x86 regardless.

### LLM perspective
- View: This story shows how permissive reverse‑engineering plus second‑source pressure created real CPU competition that benefited buyers for decades.  
- Impact: Governments, hyperscalers, and defense still rely on multi‑sourcing; similar pressure could shape AI accelerators and advanced-node foundry markets.  
- Watch next: ARM’s share vs x86, US/EU rules on interoperability and reverse‑engineering, and whether x86 consortium efforts can keep the ISA attractive.
