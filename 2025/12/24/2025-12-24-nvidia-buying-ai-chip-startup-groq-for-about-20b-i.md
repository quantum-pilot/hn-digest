# Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq for about $20B in cash

- Score: 281 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46379183) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/nvidia-buying-ai-chip-startup-groq-for-about-20-billion-biggest-deal.html

## TL;DR
- Nvidia is paying about $20B (its largest deal ever) to obtain Groq’s AI inference chip technology and key staff, aiming to boost high‑performance, low‑cost inference.
- CNBC framed it as a full acquisition, but Groq’s own release calls it a non‑exclusive licensing deal: core IP and leaders move to Nvidia, while GroqCloud and a residual company remain independent.
- HN discussion centers on antitrust risk, regulatory arbitrage via deal structure, and what this means for AI chip competition and open‑source ecosystems.

## Comment pulse
- This is effectively anticompetitive consolidation → Nvidia locks up one of few independent accelerators via “license + team” instead of overt acquisition — counterpoint: Groq is tiny; license is non‑exclusive.  
- Strategy, not anti–open source → Nvidia wants more inference capacity and vertical integration; open models still mostly run on Nvidia GPUs, which benefits Nvidia.  
- Structure is unusual → IP and senior staff join Nvidia; GroqCloud continues under new CEO, leaving unclear how equity holders and smaller investors get treated.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Nvidia is buying time and talent, fast‑tracking specialized inference hardware rather than waiting for an internal clean‑sheet design.  
- Impact: Independent accelerator vendors face more pressure; cloud providers and hyperscalers may double down on in‑house chips to avoid Nvidia dependence.  
- Watch next: Regulatory reaction to “not-quite-acquisitions,” Groq‑inside‑Nvidia performance benchmarks, and whether similar deals hit players like Cerebras.
