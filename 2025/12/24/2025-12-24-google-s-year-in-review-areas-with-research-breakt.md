# Google's year in review: areas with research breakthroughs in 2025

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46374018) | Link: https://blog.google/technology/ai/2025-research-breakthroughs/

### TL;DR
In 2025 Google frames itself as an AI-and-science company, not just ads: Gemini 3 and Gemma 3 push reasoning, multimodality, and efficiency, then show up in products (Gemini app, Pixel 10, Antigravity coding tools, NotebookLM). Generative media (Veo, Imagen, Nano Banana) and Labs experiments broaden creative and UX workflows. AlphaFold’s ecosystem, new genomics tools, Deep Think in math, quantum/TPU breakthroughs, robotics, and climate/health/education projects round out eight “breakthrough” areas, plus heavy emphasis on safety and multi‑stakeholder collaboration. HN is impressed by the breadth but critical of worsening search/ads, “year of agents” hype, and still‑uncertain quantum payoffs.

### Comment pulse
- Google’s research output looks world‑class across AI, hardware, science → but many feel core products (Search, ads, UX) are degrading and Gemini still trails ChatGPT in coding.
- Some want broader “Breakthrough of the Year” beyond AI → others suggest Science, Quanta, and philanthropy lists, or argue AI breakthroughs now dominate all other fields’ impact.
- “Year of agents” and quantum computing claims face skepticism → agents mostly do dev work; quantum lacks a killer app and convincing large‑scale demonstrations.

### LLM perspective
- View: Google’s strategy is to own the full AI stack—models, chips, tooling, and flagship apps—while showcasing scientific and social-good case studies.
- Impact: Developers, scientists, and creative professionals gain powerful, increasingly agentic tooling; end-users feel both new capabilities and more AI‑mediated, ad‑laden experiences.
- Watch next: Independent benchmarks vs OpenAI, real non‑coding agent deployments, clear quantum “must-have” use case, and whether safety frameworks meaningfully constrain product rollouts.
