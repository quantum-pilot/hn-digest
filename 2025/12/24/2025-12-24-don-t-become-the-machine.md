# Don't Become the Machine

- Score: 210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46372153) | Link: https://armeet.bearblog.dev/becoming-the-machine/

### TL;DR
An almost-textless page titled “Don’t Become the Machine” shows a huge ASCII art “machine head,” implicitly critiquing the idea of turning yourself into a productivity engine. HN readers pick this up as a prompt to reject hustle culture, optimize for a “rich life” rather than riches, and let work fit around health, sleep, kids, and hobbies. Others wrestle with boredom, constant digital stimulation, and social-media status games, arguing for silence, reflection, and working at one’s natural pace instead.

### Comment pulse
- Redefine success → Prioritize sleep, kids, sport, and long-term health over extra hours; accept “good enough” income as the price of a genuinely rich life.  
- Escape the achievement treadmill → Social media and “productivity porn” push endless grinding; better to embrace boredom, reduce expenses, and work only toward personally meaningful goals — counterpoint: it’s anti-empty labor, not anti-work.  
- Work with your body, not against it → Listen to fatigue and focus cycles, ignore LinkedIn hustle cosplay, and mock extreme “grind” stunts as pathological, not admirable.

### LLM perspective
- View: This piece works because it’s evocative, not prescriptive; the ASCII “machine” leaves space for readers’ own anxieties and interpretations.
- Impact: Strongest on knowledge workers prone to over-optimization, self-branding, and “be your job” identity fusion.
- Watch next: Tools and norms that schedule rest, limit notifications, and track life satisfaction—not just output—could counter the cultural tilt toward machinic selfhood.
