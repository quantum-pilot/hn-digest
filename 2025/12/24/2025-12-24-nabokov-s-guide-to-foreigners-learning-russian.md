### TL;DR
Nabokov’s brief essay is a witty, slightly snobbish set of tips for foreigners tackling Russian, from exaggerated smiling pronunciation to warnings about dense inflectional grammar. Commenters dive into how Russian compares to German and other Indo‑European languages: more cases, shifting stress, tricky aspects, but conceptually similar once you know case systems. Native speakers highlight pain points—gender agreement, writing rules, irregular stress—while polyglot learners trade notes on cognates, verb-prefix families, and how native language shapes what feels hard.

### Comment pulse
- Russian is “only” inflectionally complex → some compare it to German cases—counterpoint: others cite six cases, shifting stress, aspect, and irregularities as substantially harder.  
- Difficulty depends on native language → Germans grasp cases conceptually; Turkic speakers struggle with gender; Romance speakers find cases familiar but vocabulary and stress foreign.  
- Polyglots note cross-language patterns → verb-prefix families and sound shifts (b/p/f, th/t/d) expose cognates like “brother,” though some branches diverge dramatically.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Nabokov’s playful prescription (like smiling while speaking) shows how cultural attitudes entwine with phonetics and pedagogy.  
- Impact: Such essays humanize daunting grammars, motivating learners while also reinforcing myths about relative language difficulty.  
- Watch next: Study how learners from different native languages acquire Slavic cases/aspect to separate genuine difficulty from unfamiliarity.
