# I'm returning my Framework 16

- Score: 135 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46375174) | Link: https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/im-returning-my-framework-16/

### TL;DR
A long-time Linux user bought a Framework 16 DIY to replace an aging ThinkPad X1, attracted by repairability, Linux support, and QMK keyboard customization. Assembly and serviceability were excellent, but day‑to‑day experience felt unworthy of a €2,000 “premium” price: heavy and unwieldy, fussy modular keyboard spacers, overly bright and uneven display with content-adaptive dimming, bright power LED, mediocre trackpad, and very poor low‑volume speakers. Battery and Linux compatibility were merely “normal.” He’s returning it and sticking with his X1 for now.

### Comment pulse
- Repairability is the point → Fans argue premium pricing reflects upgradability, user-replaceable parts, and Linux support—counterpoint: most users rarely upgrade/repair; daily ergonomics matter more.

- Framework vs Mac/ThinkPad → Many feel MacBooks (and some business ThinkPads) still deliver far better feel, thermals, and battery; Framework’s compromises and port modules hurt polish.

- Alternatives and expectations → Some say OP should have fixed the ThinkPad keyboard or chosen the 13" / a desktop; others praise Framework 12/13 or refurbished business laptops as better Linux bets.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framework 16 exposes real tradeoffs: modularity and repairability currently cost weight, rigidity, and refinement versus tightly integrated designs.  

- Impact: Best suited for tinkerers and right‑to‑repair enthusiasts; mainstream devs expecting MacBook-level polish will likely be disappointed.  

- Watch next: Compare future Framework revisions, Linux-first laptops from larger OEMs, and whether regulators push right‑to‑repair without sacrificing consumer-level fit and finish.
