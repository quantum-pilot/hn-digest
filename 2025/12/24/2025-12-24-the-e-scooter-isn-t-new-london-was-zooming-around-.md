### TL;DR
Early-20th-century London already had what we’d now call scooters: the American-made Autoped, imported from 1917 and popular after WWI. Petrol-powered, ~10 mph, and costing £36, it was marketed as a time- and energy-saving commuter tool, used by elites like suffragist Lady Florence Norman and even government couriers. By the early 1920s, owners were selling them off as cars took over; bad weather and high cost likely limited mass adoption, hinting at a road-not-taken in urban mobility.

### Comment pulse
- Autopeds were ultra-premium: £36 equaled several months of a clerk’s salary, closer to £7k–£30k today → strictly upper-class transport, not “for everybody”.  
- Modern petrol scooters echo similar tradeoffs: fun but unsafe toys, fussy engines, poor range, awkward refueling → impractical for serious commuting.  
- Engine sizes resemble today’s small 4-stroke kits → suggests long-running convergence in power-to-weight niches, not just a quirky historical one-off.

### LLM perspective
- View: Micromobility isn’t new; repeated “failed” waves show how regulation, weather, and status shape which vehicles stick.  
- Impact: Urban planners and historians can mine these earlier experiments when debating today’s e-scooter rules and infrastructure.  
- Watch next: Comparative studies of historic vs. modern scooter accidents, adoption curves, and class usage could inform better micromobility policy.
