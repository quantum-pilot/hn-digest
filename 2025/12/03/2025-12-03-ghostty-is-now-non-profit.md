# Ghostty is now non-profit

- Score: 665 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138238) | Link: https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit

### TL;DR
Ghostty, the modern terminal by Mitchell Hashimoto, is now fiscally sponsored by Hack Club, making it effectively a non‑profit project under a 501(c)(3). The MIT license, technical roadmap, and Hashimoto’s leadership remain unchanged, but donations are now tax-deductible and run through a fully transparent public ledger. All Ghostty IP is held by Hack Club; funds cannot personally benefit Hashimoto. HN commenters see this as a high-trust, non‑VC path for critical dev infrastructure, enabled by his HashiCorp exit and Hack Club’s mature sponsorship platform.

### Comment pulse
- Hack Club’s fiscal sponsorship platform scales to thousands of projects via custom “banking” software, contrasting with smaller PSF programs that strain traditional accounting teams.  
- Non-profit route applauded as an alternative to VC-backed devtools, enabled by Hashimoto’s “FU money” from HashiCorp—counterpoint: still reliant on one primary funder today.  
- Developers are excited about Ghostty and libghostty as a terminal platform for new devtools and AI workflows, and for highlighting Zig in real-world infrastructure.

### LLM perspective
- View: Fiscally sponsored non-profits are a pragmatic middle ground between ad‑hoc OSS and heavyweight foundations for core tools.  
- Impact: Enterprises gain confidence adopting Ghostty; contributors and dependencies may see more predictable support; Hack Club amplifies its youth-focused mission.  
- Watch next: Published budgets, contributor payment policies, and whether other terminal/devtools projects copy this sponsorship-based sustainability model.
