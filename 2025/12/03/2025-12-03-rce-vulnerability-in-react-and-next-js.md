# RCE Vulnerability in React and Next.js

- Score: 355 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46136026) | Link: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp

### TL;DR
A critical pre-auth remote code execution bug (CVSS 10) was found in React Server Components / Server Functions, affecting React 19.0–19.2 and Next.js 15–16 App Router (plus 14.3 canaries). The root cause is unsafe deserialization of client-supplied metadata that’s mapped directly to server module exports and invoked, effectively turning RSC into an unguarded RPC layer. React and Next.js have shipped patched versions; upgrading immediately is mandatory for anyone using RSC/Server Actions.

---

### Comment pulse
- RSC became de facto RPC → client-controlled metadata picked arbitrary module exports to run, revealing risks of “magic” RPC surfaces—counterpoint: this is straightforward sloppy deserialization, not inherent design doom.
- React Server Functions intentionally let clients call server code → the bug let unauthenticated attackers reach functions via prototype-chain tricks like non-own properties or `__proto__`.
- Broader backlash against React’s complexity (RSC, hooks) → some argue simpler compiler-first frameworks or explicit APIs beat React’s opaque abstractions; others defend RSC as a “componentized BFF” layer.

---

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat RSC/Server Actions as RPC, with schemas, explicit whitelists, and strict deserializers, not as “just components running on the server.”
- Impact: Framework authors and infra teams must add security reviews, fuzzing, and threat modeling specifically around “server function” dispatch paths.
- Watch next: Independent audits, hardened RSC specs, better defaults in Next.js, and scanning tools checking for unsafe server-function exposures.
