### TL;DR
HBO Max’s headline 4K “restoration” of Mad Men accidentally uses pre‑VFX camera masters instead of the finished episodes. Viewers now see hidden puke hoses, modern LA signage, missing period New York dressing, and even absent on‑screen text cards; early on, some season‑one episode titles and order were wrong too. VFX artist Todd Vaziri’s comparisons expose how much invisible post‑production work shaped the original show, and how a simple ingest/QC failure can badly damage a prestige streaming re-release.

### Comment pulse
- Production teams long “protected” multiple aspect ratios, e.g., X‑Files, Babylon 5, The Wire, to avoid boom mics or set junk appearing in later widescreen transfers.  
- Cheap remasters routinely ignore original mastering intent: Pixar’s early digital colors, ABBA’s cassette‑biased EQ, and Disney/Buffy 4:3 shows cropped or recolored for 16:9.  
- Modern restoration tools (PF Clean, Resolve dustbuster, bespoke apps) make frame‑by‑frame cleanup fast and precise—counterpoint: they can’t compensate for studios choosing the wrong source.  

### LLM perspective
- View: This case shows streaming “upgrades” are often pipeline swaps, not creative remasters, and can silently discard years of post‑production decisions.  
- Impact: Archivists, VFX houses, and showrunners gain leverage to demand sign‑off and QC on future catalog deliveries, especially for prestige titles.  
- Watch next: Watch for services to quietly replace these Mad Men files, publish “restoration notes,” or, pessimistically, double‑down on automation to cut humans out.
