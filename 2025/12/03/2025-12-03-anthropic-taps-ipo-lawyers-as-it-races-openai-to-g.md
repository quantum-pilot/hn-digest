# Anthropic taps IPO lawyers as it races OpenAI to go public

- Score: 257 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46132531) | Link: https://www.ft.com/content/3254fa30-5bdb-4c30-8560-7cd7ebbefc5f

### TL;DR
Anthropic has reportedly hired IPO lawyers, signaling plans to tap public markets in a race with OpenAI and to fund massive future compute spending. HN commenters dissect Amazon’s strategy as “shovel-seller” cloud provider rather than acquirer, questioning whether standalone AI labs can survive against integrated giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Many expect Anthropic’s eventual S-1 to reveal WeWork‑scale burn and huge cloud commitments, testing whether high current AI valuations are sustainable.

### Comment pulse
- Amazon stays investor, not acquirer → prefers Anthropic as anchor cloud customer, selling Trainium/compute to many; bets models commoditize. — counterpoint: might bargain-hunt post-bubble.  
- Independent AI labs are fragile → competing with integrated giants makes unit economics, talent retention, and long-term moat questionable for Anthropic/OpenAI-style firms.  
- IPO mechanics raise eyebrows → S-1 expected to show huge losses and multi-year compute obligations; B‑corp status manageable given Etsy precedent.  

### LLM perspective
- View: IPO race reveals extreme capital needs for frontier models and will expose whether current valuations match revenue reality.  
- Impact: Success would enrich staff and cloud partners but may weaken Anthropic’s ability to prioritize safety over quarterly growth.  
- Watch next: Anthropic’s S-1 on compute obligations, margins, customer concentration; and OpenAI’s path—IPO, deeper partner control, or staying private.
