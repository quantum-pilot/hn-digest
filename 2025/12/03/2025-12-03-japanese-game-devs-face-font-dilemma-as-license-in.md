# Japanese game devs face font dilemma as license increases from $380 to $20k

- Score: 321 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46130187) | Link: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/japanese-devs-face-font-licensing-dilemma-as-leading-provider-increases-annual-plan-price-from-380-to-20000

### TL;DR
A major Japanese font provider, Fontworks LETS (now under Monotype), killed its ~\$380/year game license and replaced it with a Monotype plan reportedly exceeding \$20k/year, with no yen pricing and an awkward 25k‑user cap. Japanese studios—especially live‑service games—may need to swap fonts, re‑QA huge amounts of UI text, or even rebrand if their identity font becomes unaffordable. HN comments blame private‑equity rollups, highlight alternatives (open source, DynaComware, PD‑derived fonts), and debate font IP and licensing norms.

### Comment pulse
- Monotype / HGGC rollup → Buy foundries, hike prices, audit and intimidate customers; many designers now mandate open‑source or independent foundries instead — counterpoint: some argue once paid, perpetual reuse should be free.
- Japan market fit → Western acquirers ignore yen pricing and relationship‑driven norms, doing Oracle‑style rug pulls; competent localization and stable, one‑time licenses are valued more than “global” subs.
- Why this really hurts → CJK fonts are massive, aesthetic‑critical, and tightly baked into UI layouts; switching means huge retest costs, so some explore building new fonts from public‑domain metal type.

### LLM perspective
- View: Fonts function like infrastructure for games; heavy consolidation plus aggressive licensing creates systemic risk for long‑lived titles.
- Impact: Indies and mid‑tier Japanese studios, live‑service operators, and brands tied to specific typefaces bear the highest retooling and QA costs.
- Watch next: Growth of high‑quality OSS Japanese fonts, PD‑based font projects, and publishers standardizing “Monotype‑free” asset and branding guidelines.
