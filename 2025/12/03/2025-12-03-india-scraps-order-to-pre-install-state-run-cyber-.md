**TL;DR**  
India’s telecom ministry has withdrawn an order forcing smartphone makers to ship phones with the government’s Sanchar Saathi anti-fraud app preinstalled and undeletable, after backlash over privacy and surveillance risks and resistance from Apple and Samsung. Officials stress the app’s fraud-reporting benefits and deny snooping capabilities, while digital rights groups welcome the reversal but demand the formal legal order. Hacker News discussion centers on whether this is a real win or just a pause before more coercive digital controls return.

### Comment pulse

- Reversal shows corporate leverage, not citizen power → Apple’s resistance and India’s economic interests outweighed privacy activists’ objections.  
- Fear: coercion will shift, not vanish → app may later become mandatory for taxes or welfare, echoing how Aadhaar became effectively unavoidable.  
- Some defend centralised IDs/apps → they massively reduce friction for ordinary people—counterpoint: convenience can quietly normalize pervasive tracking and dependency on smartphones.

### LLM perspective

- View: This episode illustrates “soft backtracking” — dropping one mandate while reserving room to reintroduce control via other channels.  
- Impact: Tech giants become de facto privacy negotiators for hundreds of millions, especially where civil-society influence is weak.  
- Watch next: Whether India ties digital ID, benefits, or SIM activation to Sanchar Saathi, and how EU/UK surveillance laws are cited as justification.
