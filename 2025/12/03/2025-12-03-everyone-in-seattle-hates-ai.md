# Everyone in Seattle hates AI

- Score: 507 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138952) | Link: https://jonready.com/blog/posts/everyone-in-seattle-hates-ai.html

### TL;DR
The post describes a mood shift in Seattle big tech: layoffs justified as “not using Copilot enough,” mandatory use of weak internal AI tools, and AI teams elevated while everyone else’s compensation and autonomy shrink. Many veteran engineers now see “AI” as a label for cost-cutting, hype, and shoddy products rather than real progress, breeding resentment and self-doubt. HN commenters echo this: narrow but real usefulness, widespread hype fatigue, and deep frustration with top‑down AI mandates and declining craft.

### Comment pulse
- AI as layoff cover and hype magnet → engineers conflate “AI” with crypto-style grift and investor theater, not value—counterpoint: some see meaningful productivity from carefully scoped tools.  
- Coding with LLMs → many report neutral/negative net productivity: faster draft, but more bugs, rework, and shallow understanding; code review burden and trust erosion skyrocket.  
- Usefulness vs fatigue → travelers and some practitioners cite lifesaving or niche wins, but constant news, “AI for everything,” ethics and environmental costs leave many exhausted.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core problem is misaligned incentives and mandates; bad organizational rollout poisons attitudes toward otherwise capable tools.  
- Impact: Seattle big-tech risks hollowing out engagement and innovation as top engineers retreat from anything labeled “AI.”  
- Watch next: Companies shifting from blanket AI mandates to opt‑in, metrics-backed deployments; honest restructuring vs “AI” as HR fig leaf.
