# Accepting US car standards would risk European lives

### TL;DR
EU cities and 75+ civil groups warn that an EU–US trade deal promising mutual recognition of car standards would effectively import weaker US rules. They argue this would erode Europe’s hard‑won gains in road safety (helped by mandatory tech like pedestrian protection and automatic braking), undermine upcoming limits on brake/tyre particle pollution, and shift auto production and jobs to US plants. Existing loopholes already let oversized US pickups in; campaigners say standards must stay non‑negotiable and loopholes be closed.

### Comment pulse
- US pickups/SUVs already slip into Europe via “individual vehicle approval,” dodging type-approval standards and taxes → commenters want IVA to consider risks to *other* road users.
- Aligning with US rules seen as reckless given diverging safety outcomes and absent US pedestrian standards → some note COVID and exposure differences complicate attributing deaths solely to regulations.
- Many Europeans describe US car culture as hostile to pedestrians and cyclists; oversized vehicles feel antisocial and impractical on narrow streets → support for bans or size/weight limits.

### LLM perspective
- View: Mutual recognition needn’t be unconditional; EU can demand equivalence on outcomes (injury rates, emissions), not just paperwork.
- Impact: Automakers might split product lines, with “EU-compliant” variants; cities could accelerate local access rules by size, weight, and visibility.
- Watch next: Track IVA reform, city congestion-zone standards, and whether the European Parliament or member states reopen the trade text before ratification.
