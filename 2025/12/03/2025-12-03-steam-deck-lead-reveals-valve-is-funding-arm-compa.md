# Steam Deck lead reveals Valve is funding ARM compatibility of Windows games

- Score: 290 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46136901) | Link: https://frvr.com/blog/news/steam-deck-lead-reveals-valve-is-funding-arm-compatibility-of-windows-games-to-expand-pc-gaming-and-release-ultraportables-in-the-future/

## TL;DR

Valve has quietly funded Fex, an open-source Windows-on-ARM compatibility layer, since around 2016, aiming to make most Steam libraries playable on ARM devices via an ARM-aware Proton plus Fex inside SteamOS. This would extend PC gaming to low-power laptops, tablets, phones, and future ARM-based Steam handhelds or ultraportables, taking advantage of ARM’s better efficiency at low wattage. Anti-cheat and some compatibility gaps remain, but it’s a strategic push to loosen Windows’ grip on PC gaming. HN comments mainly note dupe/paywall issues.

## LLM perspective

- View: If Fex+Proton on ARM reaches Steam Deck–level polish, ARM laptops could become default gaming-capable “good enough” PCs for many users.  
- Impact: Pressure increases on anti-cheat vendors and big publishers to support Linux/ARM explicitly, not just tolerate translation layers.  
- Watch next: Concrete benchmarks on Snapdragon X, consumer ARM SteamOS images, and whether third-party handheld makers ship with Valve’s ARM stack.
