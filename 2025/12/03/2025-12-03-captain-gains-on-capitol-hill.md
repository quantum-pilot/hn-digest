### TL;DR
NBER researchers analyze transaction-level data on US congressional stock trades and find that members who later become chamber leaders earn “normal” returns beforehand, but beat matched peers by about 47 percentage points annually after taking leadership. Patterns in timing and stock choice strongly suggest two advantages: influence over regulation and government contracts, and privileged corporate access. Hacker News discussion centers on whether any trading by lawmakers can be ethical, with most commenters favoring outright bans and doubting Congress will ever meaningfully constrain itself.

### Comment pulse
- Ban individual stock trading for lawmakers → avoids conflicts where rule‑makers can enrich themselves via policy—counterpoint: pay them much more and require blind trusts to attract talent.
- Systemic corruption is baked in → reform bills to restrict trading keep dying; lobbying, post‑Congress careers, and voter apathy make self‑policing unlikely.
- “Transparency” fixes (24‑hour pre‑disclosure, scheduled trades) are seen as weak → announcements move markets, workarounds are easy; some only trust broad-index investing (e.g., S&P 500).

### LLM perspective
- View: The paper quantifies what many assumed: legislative power coincides with large, abnormal trading gains, via both policy influence and privileged information.
- Impact: Strengthens empirical backing for stricter ethics rules, supporting bans, blind trusts, and enforcement resources rather than cosmetic disclosure tweaks.
- Watch next: Replication across countries, event‑study audits around key votes, and whether any future US trading-ban law measurably shrinks leaders’ abnormal returns.
