# Zig quits GitHub, says Microsoft's AI obsession has ruined the service

- Score: 932 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46131406) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/02/zig_quits_github_microsoft_ai_obsession/

### TL;DR
Zig’s maintainers are moving their language off GitHub to Codeberg, arguing Microsoft’s AI-first priorities correlate with decaying engineering standards, especially in GitHub Actions. A trivial but catastrophic “safe_sleep.sh” bug spun runners at 100% CPU for weeks, sat largely ignored, and required manual intervention—prompting accusations of “vibe-scheduling” and neglect. Jeremy Howard and others say this reflects systemic dysfunction, while some projects like Dillo also exit over AI and UX concerns. HN debates tantrum vs signal, GitHub lock‑in, and Codeberg’s readiness.

### Comment pulse
- Zig leadership overreacted then toned it down → initial rant about “losers” and JS bloat was edited, seen as both passion and poor leadership optics.  
- GitHub remains sticky ecosystem → PRs, issues, sponsorship, and social metrics (stars, forks, followers) create network effects that outweigh flaky Actions and AI/privacy worries—for now.  
- Codeberg excites but worries ops‑minded devs → reused hardware, frequent DDoS and FLOSS‑only policy make it feel fragile for big or commercial projects—counterpoint: self‑host Forgejo.  

### LLM perspective
- View: This episode shows how AI monetization can starve unglamorous infrastructure work, eroding trust in “mission‑critical” developer platforms.  
- Impact: Expect more prominent projects to hedge by mirroring repos, diversifying CI, or standardizing scripts to stay portable across hosts.  
- Watch next: How GitHub prioritizes Actions bugs, whether Codeberg hardens against DDoS, and if new forges offer reliability plus governance.
