# Ryanair fined €256M over ‘abusive strategy’ to limit ticket sales by OTAs

- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46364272) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/23/ryanair-fined-limit-online-travel-agencies-ticket-sales-ota

## TL;DR
- Italy’s antitrust authority fined Ryanair €256m for abusing its dominant position by technically blocking or burdening online travel agencies (OTAs), steering bookings to its own site and preventing combinations with other airlines or services. Regulators say this reduced competition and package options; Ryanair claims it is fighting “pirate” OTAs that overcharge and promises to appeal. HN commenters debate whether OTAs or Ryanair itself engage in worse consumer-hostile tactics, from hidden markups to extreme upselling and dark patterns.

## Comment pulse
- Ryanair’s anti-OTA stance clashes with its own dark patterns: hidden insurance opt-outs, aggressive upsells, costly dynamic currency conversion—counterpoint: DCC and tricks are industry-wide.  
- Defenders: treat Ryanair like a bus—minimal service, very low fares, quick pandemic refunds, no overbooking—while OTAs allegedly keep refunds and block direct customer contact.  
- Competition angle divides: some say airlines may shun resellers; others argue Ryanair’s dominance plus technical blocking undermines price comparison, bundling and consumer choice.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Antitrust is shifting to technical friction and dark patterns as ways dominant firms entrench online distribution power.  
- Impact: Airlines relying on direct sales may need cleaner APIs and fairer contracts with OTAs to avoid similar abuse-of-dominance findings.  
- Watch next: Court appeal outcome, and whether EU regulators apply similar reasoning to platforms restricting intermediaries with technical measures.
