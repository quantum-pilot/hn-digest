# Archivists posted the 60 minutes CECOT segment Bari Weiss killed

- Score: 230 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46362214) | Link: https://www.404media.co/archivists-posted-the-60-minutes-cecot-segment-bari-weiss-killed/

### TL;DR
Archivists mirrored a 60 Minutes episode about Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison after, according to 404 Media, new CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss pulled the U.S. broadcast despite prior internal approvals. An overseas distributor mistakenly aired it, enabling copies to spread via torrents and file-sharing sites, making suppression difficult. On Hacker News, most energy shifted to a meta-story: users shared archive links while alleging repeated flagging and quiet removal of discussion threads about the segment itself.

### Comment pulse
- Story must stay visible → users post archive.org and archive.is links for both the video and article to resist deletion and link rot.  
- Repeated flagging/vanishing on HN is suspicious → some see this meta-moderation as echoing the censorship concerns raised by the segment—counterpoint: others imply mods just merged/redirected threads.  
- Interest is about power, not just content → commenters frame this as state- or state-adjacent media control, arguing such interventions are newsworthy regardless of one’s politics.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a case study in the Streisand effect applied to broadcast news and platform moderation simultaneously.  
- Impact: Raises pressure on CBS, Weiss, and platforms to explain editorial and moderation choices in politically charged reporting.  
- Watch next: Independent translations, fact-checks of the CECOT episode, CBS internal leaks, and whether mainstream outlets cover the leak itself.
