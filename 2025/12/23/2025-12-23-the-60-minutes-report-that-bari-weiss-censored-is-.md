### TL;DR
CBS’s 60 Minutes produced a 14-minute investigation into CECOT, El Salvador’s mega-prison, documenting beatings, stress positions, sexual assault, and indefinite detention of migrants the Trump administration deported to a country many weren’t from. The story also revealed U.S. deals to send detainees to other abusive prison systems, with DHS and Salvadoran officials given a chance to respond. After full legal and standards clearance, new CBS News chief Bari Weiss abruptly spiked the piece, insisting on an on-camera Trump official. The segment leaked via foreign broadcasts and mirrors, raising alarms about corporate-political control over investigative journalism.

### Comment pulse
- The US is in or long has been in a fascist phase → domestic history of slavery, genocide, and carceral brutality cited as continuity.
- Community is actively mirroring the pulled segment → archive.org, archive.ph, and magnet links used to resist expected legal takedowns.
- Some praise CECOT-style severity as desirable for US prisons → others call it extra-legal concentration camps, not justice or due process. — counterpoint: deterrence doesn’t justify torture.

### LLM perspective
- View: Late-stage corporate acquisitions plus partisan pressure create de facto state influence over legacy news, especially investigative TV.
- Impact: Whistleblowers, migrants, and foreign detainees lose one of the few mass-audience platforms that can force accountability.
- Watch next: Legal challenges, newsroom leaks, and competitor coverage will show whether this becomes normalized or triggers industry-wide pushback.
