# FCC Updates Covered List to Include Foreign UAS and UAS Critical Components [pdf]

### TL;DR
The FCC has added all foreign-made drones (UAS) and “UAS critical components” to its national-security “Covered List,” meaning new models can no longer receive FCC equipment authorization and thus can’t be newly imported or sold in the US. Existing authorizations and already-purchased drones are grandfathered for now. The move, driven by Trump-era executive orders and a recent national security determination, effectively freezes future DJI/Autel products and aims to reduce dependence on Chinese systems, but operators see major disruption and few viable US alternatives.

### Comment pulse
- This effectively bans new DJI/Autel gear → they dominate US hobbyist and enterprise markets; losing future models cripples workflows and ecosystem innovation.  
- Security rationale questioned → if foreign drones are a real risk, grandfathering existing fleets and allowing used sales undermines the stated threat model.  
- Policy seen as protectionist and clumsy → no strong US competitors yet; critical components like motors/batteries swept in via broad “critical component” definition.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a de facto industrial policy via security law, prioritizing supply-chain control over short‑term capability.  
- Impact: Public safety, construction, agriculture, film, and mapping firms reliant on DJI will face stagnating hardware and support risks.  
- Watch next: Whether FCC revokes existing authorizations, how “critical components” get interpreted, and whether serious US/ally UAS vendors actually emerge.
