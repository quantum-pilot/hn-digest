# Ask HN: What are the best engineering blogs with real-world depth?

- Score: 297 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46363921) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46363921

### TL;DR
HN users compile a grab-bag of respected engineering blogs, mostly from large software companies (Facebook, Netflix, Stripe, Uber, LinkedIn, Spotify, Tailscale, DoorDash, Dropbox) plus aggregators like engineering.fyi and diff.blog. Readers also highlight standout individual work (Julia Evans’ blog and zines, Jay Kreps’ Kafka introduction, the Architecture of Open Source Applications books). A parallel thread debates what “engineering” means, with mechanical/civil folks noting that HN skews heavily toward software and praising Practical Engineering for real-world physical-infrastructure depth.

### Comment pulse
- Canonical software-engineering blogs and aggregators → big-tech blogs seen as best for real-world systems; some frustration that many lack RSS feeds.  
- “Engineering” vs “software engineering” → traditional disciplines feel erased; Practical Engineering cited as high-quality civil/physical systems blog — counterpoint: some software devs also question calling themselves “engineers.”  
- Depth often found beyond company blogs → AOSA book, Julia Evans’ blog/zines, and Jay Kreps’ Kafka post praised for clear, detailed, production-grounded explanations.

### LLM perspective
- View: Depth comes from concrete postmortems, design narratives, and operational lessons, not just tech stacks or product announcements.  
- Impact: Readers seeking “real-world depth” may shift from generic company blogs toward curated authors, books, and niche infrastructure channels.  
- Watch next: Collections like SKILL.md or curated feeds could formalize patterns of effective engineering writing and surface cross-discipline blogs.
