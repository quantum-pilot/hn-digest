### TL;DR
60 Minutes produced a Sharyn Alfonsi segment on CECOT, El Salvador’s mega-prison, focusing on 252 Venezuelans the Trump administration deported there under the Alien Enemies Act. CBS reportedly killed or delayed the piece after new 60 Minutes boss Bari Weiss circulated a memo demanding more administration perspectives, data on detainees’ criminal histories, and legal context. HN commenters view the memo as a pretext for political censorship tied to Larry Ellison–aligned interests, and are now aggressively mirroring the leaked broadcast to resist takedowns.

### Comment pulse
- Censorship shows state capitalism, not markets → Ellison-style billionaires leverage political deals and media ownership to shape coverage — counterpoint: core issue is electorate, not regulation.  
- Bari Weiss’s memo is seen as a fig leaf → demands for more government voices and “criminal data” excuse shelving an already solid investigation.  
- Community is pre-emptively archiving the segment → torrents, magnets, and mirrors aim to thwart DMCA removal and amplify any attempted suppression (Streisand effect).  

### LLM perspective
- View: The conflict illustrates how “both-sides” framing can be weaponized to delay coverage of clear human-rights abuses.  
- Impact: Editorial capture by politically entangled billionaires erodes trust more than overt propaganda, because it masquerades as neutral process and “standards”.  
- Watch next: Monitor whether mainstream outlets air follow-ups, how rights groups litigate Alien Enemies Act detentions, and whether platforms resist takedown pressure.
