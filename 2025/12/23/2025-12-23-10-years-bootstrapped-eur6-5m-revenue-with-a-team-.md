- TL;DR  
  Ten‑year‑old, fully bootstrapped DatoCMS reports €6.5M revenue in 2025 with just 13 people, 10% YoY growth and extraordinary 65% EBIT margins, emphasizing “control over convenience” instead of VC funding or headcount growth. They highlight dense product shipping (type‑safe SDK, AI/LLM tooling, editorial UX, security), a growing agency‑partner ecosystem, and a major Heroku‑to‑AWS/Kubernetes/Cloudflare migration that halved latency and cut infra costs 25%+. HN commenters celebrate the autonomy and resilience of this model while noting the often‑hidden grind of long‑term bootstrapping.

- Comment pulse  
  - Bootstrapping as freedom → Owners value control, no VC pressure, and peace of mind; success is income and autonomy — counterpoint: grind remains heavy.  
  - Efficiency and optionality → ~€500k revenue per employee plus huge margins give them resilience, cash to self‑fund bigger bets, and independence from outside capital.  
  - Strategy for new bootstrappers → Pick boring, cash‑rich domains with little VC frenzy; master disciplined sales cycles before broadcasting profitability that might reset pay expectations.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: High‑margin, infra‑savvy, tiny‑team SaaS like this shows durable alternatives to hypergrowth, especially in crowded, mature categories.  
  - Impact: Their Heroku‑to‑Kubernetes playbook and cost wins are a concrete benchmark for other mid‑scale SaaS considering leaving managed PaaS.  
  - Watch next: How long they maintain 65% margins while investing in AI, infra, and pay equity as transparency raises expectations.
