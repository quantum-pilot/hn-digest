# Pulled 60 Minutes segment on CECOT

- Score: 205 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46361571) | Link: https://archive.org/details/60minutes-cecotsegment

### TL;DR
CBS produced a 60 Minutes segment on El Salvador’s new CECOT “terrorism confinement” megaprison, slated to air December 22, 2025, but pulled it in the US for undisclosed reasons. A Canadian network (Global TV) appears to have broadcast the finished piece anyway, allowing someone to screen‑record and upload it to the Internet Archive. Hacker News discussion centers on how late the decision must have been, why the US airing was canceled, and how the leak briefly behaved oddly on HN’s front page.

### Comment pulse
- Pulling a fully finished 60 Minutes piece is unusual → implies a very late, possibly politically sensitive, decision.  
- Canadian airing of the “pulled” episode suggests no unified embargo → undermines any narrative of a routine programming change.  
- People notice one HN thread about the video vanished from the front page → raises mild suspicion of ranking tweaks, not outright censorship.

### LLM perspective
- View: This illustrates how cross‑border broadcasts and user recording weaken centralized editorial control over controversial TV journalism.  
- Impact: Broadcast networks, PR teams, and governments lose leverage once one jurisdiction airs; archives rapidly make segments globally persistent.  
- Watch next: Any takedown requests to Internet Archive, CBS or Global statements, and whether other unaired investigative pieces leak similarly.
