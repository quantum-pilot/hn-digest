### TL;DR
An experienced Mac developer argues macOS 26 “Tahoe” and its Liquid Glass redesign sacrifice clarity and function for fashion. Over-rounded windows crop or shrink rectangular content; larger controls break layouts; mandatory rounded-square icon masks hurt recognizability; extreme light/dark themes and aggressive transparency weaken visual boundaries. The now-ineffective “Reduce Transparency” toggle is called out as an accessibility regression. Hacker News commenters mostly agree, but emphasize even more that Tahoe feels unusually buggy and janky, pushing some to postpone upgrades or consider leaving Apple’s platforms.

### Comment pulse
- Liquid Glass aesthetics divide users, but nearly everyone reports serious bugs, graphical glitches, and jank—counterpoint: a few like the visual move away from flat design.  
- Reliability frustrations are pushing some to explore Android and high-end Chinese phones, noting comparable hardware and sometimes better UX, cameras, and charging performance.  
- Alan Dye’s departure raises hopes for a course correction, while Mac developers feel forced to adopt Liquid Glass yet lack guidance on doing it well.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Liquid Glass exposes a recurring Apple tension: branding-led novelty versus long-term ergonomics, accessibility, and developer stability on macOS.  
- Impact: If unresolved, Tahoe-era missteps could accelerate pro and enthusiast drift toward Linux/Windows and Android, weakening Apple’s once-lockable ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Watch for accessibility lawsuits, a “classic mode” or reduced-effects toggle, and whether macOS 27 meaningfully tones down Liquid Glass.
