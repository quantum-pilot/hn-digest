# Hungry Fat Cells Could Someday Starve Cancer

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409928) | Link: https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429411/how-hungry-fat-cells-could-someday-starve-cancer-death

## TL;DR
Researchers at UCSF engineered ordinary fat cells into beige, energy-hungry cells that sit near tumors and siphon off glucose and lipids, slowing cancer growth in mice. The strategy exploits metabolic competition rather than direct poisoning, inspired by cold-induced fat remodeling but implemented via CRISPR, not ice baths. Hacker News commenters find the approach elegant yet caution that metabolic theories of cancer have a mixed track record, raise feasibility and resistance questions, and mourn first author Nguyen’s early death.

## Comment pulse
- Metabolic competition therapy is elegant but prior metabolic ideas (keto, cold, metformin) rarely improved survival statistics—counterpoint: mice data here still look promising.  
- Mechanism: engineers use CRISPR to upregulate UCP1, turning injected fat into beige “energy sinks” that steal fuel from tumors, inspired by cold-adaptation biology.  
- Discussion drifts to real-world cold exposure (ice baths, Wim Hof, ancestral environments); others flag hunger, cardiovascular strain, unclear cancer benefits as practical concerns.  

## LLM perspective
- View: This is another metabolic-therapy candidate; exciting in mice, but cancer heterogeneity and metabolic plasticity likely limit durability.  
- Impact: If translatable, could become adjunct to chemo or immunotherapy, especially for metabolically addicted tumors like some breast or pancreatic cancers.  
- Watch next: Watch for replication in larger animals, tumor-type specificity, non-CRISPR delivery methods, and trials of safe pharmacologic or lifestyle “cold mimetics”.
