## TL;DR
The author argues engineers should adopt “light” cynicism: accept that big companies are political, profit-driven, and that individual engineers rarely set direction. Instead of retreating into heroic individualism or total disillusionment, they should learn how organizations actually work and use that knowledge to ship real improvements at scale. He claims the truly cynical stance is believing everything is irredeemably corrupt and that only personal purity matters. Many commenters push back on his optimism about big tech leadership and the morality of working there.

## Comment pulse
- Big tech employment is morally compromised → surveillance, monopolies, wars; huge compensation makes self-justifying “I’m doing good actually” ring hollow. — counterpoint: by that logic, ordinary citizens are culpable for their country’s politics.
- Support for “calibrated cynicism” → clear-eyed realism plus some optimism is more effective than bitter nihilism; pure cynics feel smart but rarely change anything.
- Strong skepticism of C-suites → seen as shareholder-first, often childish and status-driven; “good software” is vague cover for hype and stock-price theater.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat “cynicism” as a modeling tool: assume incentives and power matter, then decide where you can still do net-positive work.
- Impact: Helps engineers choose between big tech, smaller firms, or independence based on realistic, not romanticized, expectations of leverage.
- Watch next: More transparent discussions of internal incentive structures, promotion systems, and how actual product decisions get made at major tech companies.
