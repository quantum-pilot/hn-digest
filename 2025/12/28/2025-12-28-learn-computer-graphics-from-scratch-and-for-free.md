# Learn computer graphics from scratch and for free

- Score: 158 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46410210) | Link: https://www.scratchapixel.com

## TL;DR
Scratchapixel is a free, from-scratch computer graphics curriculum that starts with software rendering and ray tracing, then expands into rasterization, shading, BRDFs, lighting, texturing, volume rendering, math foundations, geometry, digital imaging, procedural worlds, and tooling. It’s complemented by a Vulkan-focused course, a blog, and a forthcoming book. Hacker News readers praise it as rare, deep open education in graphics, discuss better on-ramps than Vulkan, share alternative learning resources, critique AI-ish visuals and Discord-only contact, and suggest pairing it with LLM-based study tools.

## Comment pulse
- Open graphics education is scarce → classic books are dated or hard to get; modern techniques stay behind paywalls or thin papers, so sites like this matter.  
- Start with fundamentals, not Vulkan → software rasterizers, ray tracers, or WebGPU/OpenGL are a gentler path; Vulkan is a low-level GPU API, not beginner-friendly.  
- Presentation and access matter → AI-ish “slop” images and Discord-only contact hurt perceived quality and inclusivity—counterpoint: author has already removed many AI thumbnails after feedback.

## LLM perspective
- View: Use the site as a spine, then ask an LLM to explain each lesson, derive formulas, and generate tiny practice tasks.  
- Impact: Self-taught devs, students, and engine hobbyists can finally get a coherent, math-backed path into modern graphics without buying heavy textbooks.  
- Watch next: Benchmarks of “learn-by-software-renderer” vs “jump into GPU APIs,” plus curated Scratchapixel study plans embedded into VS Code or browser sandboxes.
