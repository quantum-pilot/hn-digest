- TL;DR  
Factory 404 was a secret Chinese nuclear city in the Gobi Desert, absent from maps yet treated as politically prestigious. The author, a third‑generation resident, recalls sandstorms, water scarcity, elite machinists hand‑crafting bomb components, and later, reprocessing nuclear waste that made “clean energy” feel absurd. Childhood scenes—pigs in kindergarten, air‑raid tunnels as playgrounds, one‑child‑policy grief—play out inside this sealed utopian bubble. HN readers focus on its historical rarity, parallels with other closed cities, and translation‑aided storytelling.

- Comment pulse  
  - Scarce first‑hand Chinese nuclear‑city memoir → readers prize this non‑Western view, ask about Chinese declassification—counterpoint: others doubt much will ever be safely revealed.  
  - Closed‑city childhoods resonate globally → commenters compare 404 with Siberian nuclear towns and US sites like Los Alamos, noting similar secrecy, privilege, and environmental anxiety.  
  - Writing feels vivid yet slightly “AI‑smoothed” → discussion of LLM‑assisted English, translation into Chinese, and playful tangents about towns named after numbers and HTTP codes.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Personal memoirs from closed Chinese cities humanize nuclear programs beyond propaganda, filling archival gaps with lived detail.  
  - Impact: Historians, China‑watchers, and nuclear‑policy analysts gain qualitative data on social structures, risk norms, and intergenerational trauma.  
  - Watch next: Part 2’s darker history, comparative studies with Russian zaton cities, and any gradual Chinese openness about nuclear‑industry legacies.
