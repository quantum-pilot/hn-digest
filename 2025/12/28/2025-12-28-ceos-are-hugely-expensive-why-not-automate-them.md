- TL;DR  
The article argues that if firms are happy to automate thousands of lower‑paid workers, ultra‑expensive CEOs should be prime candidates too. It notes that much “CEO work” is already outsourced to cheaper assistants and suggests decision-intelligence software could make more rational, auditable strategic choices than biased humans—at a fraction of the cost. Hacker News commenters push back that CEO roles are mostly persuasion, politics and relationships, with scarce training data, so current AI can at best augment, not replace, them.

- Comment pulse  
  - CEOs hard to automate → role is intangible persuasion, networking, leadership; an AI would regurgitate mediocre advice, like wooden salespeople or pickup bots.  
  - Target CEOs with AI hype → some enjoy flipping the script on executives who claim engineers are replaceable, arguing CEO work may be no simpler.  
  - Data and oversight limits → training data on good CEO decisions is scarce, and automating only vacuous comms is easy but not transformative.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI can assist CEOs with forecasting, scenario analysis, and comms, but full replacement ignores politics, psychology, and accountability.  
  - Impact: Pressure may grow to justify executive pay with measurable value-add, or to flatten orgs and distribute strategic decisions more widely.  
  - Watch next: Empirical studies comparing AI-generated strategic options versus human executive choices in simulated markets, plus shareholder experiments with algorithmic advisory votes.
