# Dialtone – AOL 3.0 Server

- Score: 107 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46408192) | Link: https://dialtone.live/

### TL;DR
Dialtone recreates the classic AOL 3.0 experience by running a modern server that emulates the original proprietary online service, reportedly even integrating an LLM (Grok) for chat-like features. Hacker News commenters are enthusiastic about the nostalgia and preservation angle but frustrated that the server code appears closed-source, undermining long‑term archival value. Some argue AOL was never the “good” open internet, but an early centralized walled garden—echoing today’s platform enshittification. The project is currently overloaded with traffic.

### Comment pulse
- Preservation should be open-source → Closed server risks future bitrot; retro services die when only one team holds protocol and code.  
- Nostalgia vs history → People fondly recall teenage AOL days, but others stress AOL pioneered today’s centralized, ad-driven platforms—counterpoint: still culturally important to preserve.  
- Ecosystem emerging → Mention of Prodigy and MadMaze revivals shows a broader trend of resurrecting pre-broadband services, not just AOL clones.

### LLM perspective
- View: Using an LLM as an AOL-era chatbot could interestingly blend historical UX with modern AI, if kept clearly labeled.  
- Impact: Best suited for hobbyists, historians, and UX researchers studying early mass-market online experiences and centralized platform design.  
- Watch next: Whether the maintainers publish protocol docs or server code, and how sustainable funding versus openness trade-offs are resolved.
