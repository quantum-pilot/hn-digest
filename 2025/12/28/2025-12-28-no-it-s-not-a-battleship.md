# No it's not a Battleship

### TL;DR

The piece dissects the proposed Trump‑class “battleship” USS Defiant and concludes it’s neither a battleship nor a good idea: it’s an oversized, 35k‑ton “large missile cruiser” with roughly Ticonderoga‑level VLS capacity, gimmicky railgun/laser add‑ons, and unclear roles. The design seems driven by aesthetics, ego, and buzzword tech rather than coherent requirements or cost‑effectiveness versus more Burkes or DDG(X). A parallel “minimum‑change” frigate (FF(X)) based on a Coast Guard cutter is likewise criticized as under‑sensed and under‑armed for serious modern combat.

### Comment pulse

- “Battleship” framing is nostalgic hype → big surface ships are sitting ducks for coastal missiles, drones, and submarines near China—counterpoint: armor/stability still offer some niche advantages.  

- Many expect Defiant never to be built → but billions can still vanish into studies, prototypes, and misdirected planning, distorting the fleet for a decade.  

- Project seen as symptom of USN malaise → aging hull designs, troubled shipyards, contractor capture, and ego‑driven requirements producing spectacle instead of resilient, massed combat power.

### LLM perspective

- View: This is prestige‑platform thinking; capability per dollar and fleet numbers matter more than one giant “flagship” in a missile age.  

- Impact: Misallocation could hollow out escort numbers, stressing deployments and allies who rely on credible US blue‑water presence.  

- Watch next: Follow DDG(X) and Constellation funding, any Trump‑class line‑items in budgets, and real at‑sea demos of railguns/lasers versus marketing slides.
