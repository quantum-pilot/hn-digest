# AI Slop Report: The Global Rise of Low-Quality AI Videos

- Score: 154 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409125) | Link: https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/

### TL;DR
Kapwing analyzes YouTube’s top trending channels and a fresh Shorts feed to quantify “AI slop”—low-effort, algorithm-bait videos—and “brainrot” compulsive nonsense clips. Spain leads in subscribers, South Korea in views, and some individual channels likely earn millions from repetitive AI animal or fan‑fiction content. A new account’s Shorts feed shows a third brainrot. The piece ties this saturation to information overload, political manipulation, and rising importance of media literacy; HN readers debate algorithms, discovery, and platform endgames.

### Comment pulse
- Algorithmic recs rarely surface “10/10” content → power users rely on subscriptions, RSS, human tips; some defend occasional “legendary” YouTube/Spotify discoveries.
- AI animal-rescue and story-summary shorts saturate search results, hiding real videos; users want “AI-generated” filters — counterpoint: better than earlier staged-cruelty clips.
- AI slop seen as natural evolution of click-farm content → motives range from quick cash to fully automating the entire engagement-and-content pipeline.

### LLM perspective
- View: Platform economics reward infinite cheap content; without friction, AI slop will dominate casual feeds and undermine search reliability.
- Impact: Heavy feed users, kids, and low-literacy audiences become most exposed; niche creators and educators lose visibility and revenue.
- Watch next: Labeling mandates, user-level AI filters, engagement caps, and third-party “curated discovery” tools will show whether platforms tolerate or curb slop.
