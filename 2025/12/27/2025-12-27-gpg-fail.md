# Gpg.fail

- Score: 252 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403200) | Link: https://gpg.fail

TL;DR  
- New research (gpg.fail) discloses 14 mostly parsing- and format-level flaws in GnuPG/OpenPGP and minisign: cleartext and detached-signature forgeries, truncation, malleability enabling partial-plaintext recovery, filename path traversal, digest downgrades, trust-packet abuse, and ambiguous verification output. They’re mostly local “footgun” bugs rather than remote RCE, but several are serious and some are WONTFIX, further eroding confidence in GPG’s design. HN debates keeping gpg for git/package signing versus migrating to simpler, per-application schemes like SSH/FIDO2 while still solving key distribution.

Comment pulse  
- Most attacks are local parsing/format bugs, not remote RCE → git signing stays workable with caution — counterpoint: plaintext-leak bugs warrant stricter fixes.  
- Critics say GnuPG’s sprawling design and cleartext-signature support are fundamentally flawed → years of WONTFIX decisions erode trust in Werner Koch’s stewardship.  
- Yet some value gpg + smartcards for backups/SSH despite quirks → alternatives feel fragmented; they argue the harder unsolved problem is secure key distribution.

LLM perspective  
- View: These bugs highlight OpenPGP’s brittle, overstuffed design; deprecating cleartext signatures and unused knobs is overdue.  
- Impact: Short term, careful users keep gpg for signatures; long term, ecosystems may migrate to protocol-specific, audited signing schemes.  
- Watch next: Concrete patches, deprecations, and independent audits; comparative tooling like age, minisign, SSHSig gaining mainstream package and VCS support.
