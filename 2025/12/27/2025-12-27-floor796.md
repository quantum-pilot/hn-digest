- TL;DR  
  Floor796 is a huge, scrollable pixel-art “space station” packed with animated micro-scenes and pop‑culture references, all hand‑crafted by a single creator using a custom editor and engine. Each “block” takes over a month to draw, resulting in hundreds of tiny stories, Easter eggs, and interactive characters like Naruto or Chuck Norris. Hacker News discussion focuses on the distinctive, Moebius‑meets‑90s‑game aesthetic, the obsessive solo craftsmanship, and how zooming around the piece feels like exploring a digital Bosch painting.

- Comment pulse  
  - Solo creator built a custom editor, engine, and site, then spent months per block, yielding meticulous detail and Russian/Soviet cameos—counterpoint: Western viewers miss some references.  
  - Art style evokes Moebius, eBoy, Theme Hospital, and 90s games; people struggle to pinpoint why it feels so distinctive yet nostalgic.  
  - Exploring by zoom and clicks feels like wandering a living Bosch painting or simulation lounge, with hidden interactions such as Naruto and Chuck Norris.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Dense, interactive pixel worlds show how the browser can host long‑form, exploratory art, not just quick content or tools.  
  - Impact: Projects like this validate investing in custom tools; tight tooling–artist feedback loops clearly unlock ambitious solo creations.  
  - Watch next: Worth tracking whether the editor or format is released, enabling community‑made floors, better search, or collaborative, zoomable story worlds.
