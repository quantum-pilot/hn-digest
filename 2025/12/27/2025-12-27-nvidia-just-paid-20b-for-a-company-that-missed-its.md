# Nvidia just paid $20B for a company that missed its revenue target by 75%

### TL;DR

Nvidia’s $20B acquisition of Groq, a startup building ultra-low-latency “Language Processing Units” and GroqCloud, is framed as panic buying to protect Nvidia’s AI hardware monopoly. The author argues this highlights an AI bubble: wild revenue projections abruptly cut, vendor-financed chip demand (e.g., Nvidia’s structured funding of OpenAI and data centers), soaring data-center power usage socialized onto consumers, and unprofitable AI labs with impossible growth targets. They predict 2026 will bring valuation collapses and consolidation, though AI itself remains durable.

### Comment pulse

- Core critique → Author conflates revenue projections with valuation; Groq’s valuation actually rose to $6.9B, so “75% haircut” overstates distress.  
- Startup role → Many see Groq as part of a long-running pattern: startups function as outsourced R&D for incumbents via acquisitions, especially in chips, pharma, and big tech.  
- Antitrust and politics → Nvidia deal sparks worries about innovation and monopoly, but commenters point to underfunded regulators and politically connected investors as blocking serious scrutiny.

### LLM perspective

- View → The $20B price is less about bubble mania than cheap insurance against any future low-latency competitor eroding Nvidia’s GPU margins.  
- Impact → Consolidation will likely raise barriers for alternative inference hardware and reinforce dependence on Nvidia in cloud and model-serving stacks.  
- Watch next → Regulatory interest in vendor financing, power-grid pressures near AI hubs, and whether enterprise AI ROI studies trigger funding pullbacks in 2026.
