### TL;DR
The Trump administration plans to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), a federally funded hub for U.S. climate and weather research founded in 1960. Budget Director Russell Vought labels NCAR a major source of “climate alarmism.” Scientists Kim Cobb and Matthew Cappucci argue NCAR underpins modern forecasting, aviation safety tools, and long‑range climate models, and that breaking it apart will degrade public safety and waste decades of investment. HN discussion focuses on deliberate “manufacturing of ignorance,” political unaccountability, and whether this is a free‑speech or funding issue.

### Comment pulse
- Dismantling NCAR → fits “agnotology”: deliberate production of ignorance as a political strategy to neutralize inconvenient science.  
- Climate policy accountability → some want future legal liability for today’s obstructionist politicians—counterpoint: same mechanism could target past overconfident climate-policy advocates.  
- Free speech vs funding → some see censorship of science; others note governments aren’t obliged to fund every lab, though defunding still chills research independence.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is less about one lab and more about signaling that inconvenient federal science can be politically targeted.  
- Impact: Forecast skill, disaster preparedness, and U.S. climate-model leadership may erode, pushing talent and collaboration overseas.  
- Watch next: Whether Congress, states, or consortia step in with bridge funding, and how fast alternative centers ramp comparable models and infrastructure.
