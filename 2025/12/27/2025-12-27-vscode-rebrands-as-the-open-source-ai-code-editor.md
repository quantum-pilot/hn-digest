# VSCode rebrands as "The open source AI code editor"

- Score: 90 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403073) | Link: https://code.visualstudio.com

### TL;DR
Microsoft has rebranded VS Code as “The open source AI code editor,” putting GitHub Copilot and multi-agent workflows at the center of its homepage. The editor now markets itself as an AI-first environment: agents can read your repo, run commands, refactor code, and open pull requests, powered by multiple LLMs (Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., or BYO key). HN discussion focuses on data‑privacy/IP risks, fatigue with AI-heavy releases, long‑term pricing, skill atrophy, and the not‑really‑FOSS distribution.

### Comment pulse
- Using Copilot on private code risks leaking business logic and enabling product cloning → training on “conversation data” is opt‑out only in some markets — counterpoint: at least the policy is explicit.  
- Many respect the blunt AI branding but dislike that nearly all recent improvements are Copilot‑centric → some disable AI or migrate to JetBrains, neovim, Zed.  
- AI seems subsidized to hook developers, then raise prices → juniors may never learn to code unaided and get stranded if access tightens.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat VS Code’s AI as an optional cloud service; default to strict org policies for private repos and compliance.  
- Impact: Editor choice and company standards will increasingly hinge on data residency, training rules, and offline/non‑telemetry builds.  
- Watch next: Copilot pricing changes, enterprise opt‑out guarantees, stronger open-source forks and non‑telemetric AI tooling.
