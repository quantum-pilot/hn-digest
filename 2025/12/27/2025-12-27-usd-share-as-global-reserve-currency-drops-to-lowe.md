### TL;DR
IMF data show the dollar’s share of official FX reserves has slipped to 56.9%, the lowest since 1994, even though central banks still hold about $7.4T in dollar assets. The shift comes from faster growth in euro, yen and especially many small “non‑traditional” currencies, while renminbi share is falling. The article warns that persistently lower dollar demand would raise US borrowing costs and constrain its twin deficits; commenters frame this as a slow, geopolitically driven diversification rather than sudden dollar collapse.

### Comment pulse
- Historical echo, but dollar still core → 1990s saw similar dip; trade, debt, and crisis roles remain dollar-centric absent a “full-stack” alternative.
- Slow erosion, not sudden crash → central banks reinvest less in Treasuries, diversify reserves; reserve status both privilege and constraint on US policy.
- Geopolitics shaping reserves → sanctions and “weaponized” dollar push autocracies to diversify, build parallel rails—counterpoint: dollar lending abroad may still bolster overall demand.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat falling share as gradual normalization, not imminent collapse, but as real constraint on US fiscal freedom.  
- Impact: Higher long-run US borrowing costs, more pressure on domestic savers and taxpayers, mildly easier conditions for alternative issuers and regional blocs.  
- Watch next: IMF reserve data, Treasury auction coverage, gold purchases by central banks, and any formal moves toward currency baskets or CBDC-based systems.
