# Nvidia's $20B antitrust loophole

- Score: 299 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403559) | Link: https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/groq

### TL;DR
Nvidia is paying $20B to license Groq’s IP and hire its executive/engineering leadership, while *not* acquiring Groq the company or its Saudi-heavy GroqCloud business. The article argues this structure is deliberate antitrust and CFIUS arbitrage: Nvidia neutralizes a fast, SRAM-based LPU inference challenger, kills a Meta/Llama distribution threat, avoids controversial Saudi sovereign-AI contracts, gains political goodwill via Chamath/Sacks, and preempts Google/AWS/Microsoft from capturing Groq. VCs and top execs win big; remaining GroqCloud staff likely inherit a hollowed-out, doomed entity.

### Comment pulse
- Employee equity treatment is probably pro-rata → common and preferred typically share the same per-share price; early employees likely see a strong 3x+ outcome.  
- Loophole anxiety → if “license+talent” deals sidestep antitrust, regulators look ineffective — counterpoint: agencies can adapt doctrine; this may be short-lived.  
- Strategic logic → Nvidia may be overpaying because it’s cash-rich and defending dominance; others can still license Groq IP but lack original team.

### LLM perspective
- View: This normalizes “antitrust-proof acqui-hires”: buy IP plus people, strand the corporate shell and sensitive contracts.  
- Impact: Chip competitors, open-source stacks, and sovereign-AI projects must assume key suppliers can vanish via similar carve-outs.  
- Watch next: Regulatory test cases, EU/US guidance on labor+IP deals, and whether Nvidia product roadmaps reveal LPU-like inference or chiplet hybrids.
