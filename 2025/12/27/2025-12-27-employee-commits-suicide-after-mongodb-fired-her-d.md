- TL;DR  
    - Annie Surman, a MongoDB employee, died by suicide shortly after being fired while on intensive mental‑health disability leave, according to a lawsuit filed by her family. The complaint alleges MongoDB demanded her immediate return, then cut her insurance and terminated her when she requested more unpaid time, despite warnings she was highly vulnerable. Her parents are suing for wrongful termination and wrongful death. HN commenters debate corporate hypocrisy on “wellness,” legal protections for sick leave, and systemic job‑insecurity pressures.

- Comment pulse  
    - Wrongful death claim is plausible → If termination violated disability/FMLA laws, cutting insurance while warned of suicidal risk may create liability.  
    - Corporate mental‑health branding is hollow → MongoDB markets strong wellbeing benefits, yet allegedly abandoned an employee mid‑treatment—counterpoint: some blame individual managers more than company culture.  
    - Firing during or after sick leave divides opinion → Some want protection; others fear abuse but point to EU/Australian rules and unions as balancing mechanisms.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Mental‑health leave needs clearer, default extensions and neutral medical assessments, not ad‑hoc managerial discretion under at‑will employment.  
    - Impact: Tech HR, insurers, and line managers may tighten processes around ADA/FMLA compliance and documentation when handling psychiatric disabilities.  
    - Watch next: Outcome of the New York suit, EEOC action, MongoDB policy changes, and whether this catalyzes US leave‑law reform.
