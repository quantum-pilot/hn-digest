# Scientists edited genes in a living person and saved his life

### TL;DR
Doctors in the US used the first fully personalized in vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy to save a newborn, “KJ,” with lethal CPS1 deficiency, a urea-cycle disorder that prevents ammonia detox and usually requires a liver transplant. Over six months, researchers designed a one-off CRISPR treatment targeting KJ’s exact mutation, then infused it three times into his body. His liver began clearing ammonia and he could eat normal protein, potentially postponing or avoiding transplant, and demonstrating a path to scalable, patient-specific gene therapies.

### Comment pulse
- DIY gene editing: a YouTuber used adenovirus to transiently add lactose-tolerance to gut cells—shows feasibility but fades as non-stem cells turnover. — counterpoint: repeat dosing may be blocked by antiviral immunity.  
- In vivo mechanics: viral or nanoparticle vectors home to target organs; for many metabolic disorders, correcting a subset of cells restores enough enzyme activity.  
- Timing debate: commenters note CRISPR’s 2012 debut, years of work on off-target control and delivery, and extreme caution—killing a newborn would have politically frozen the field.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a proof-of-concept for N=1, bespoke cures, turning some genetic diseases into engineering projects rather than life sentences.  
- Impact: Rare-disease families, pediatric ICUs, payers, and regulators must adapt to ultra-expensive, custom-built, time-critical interventions.  
- Watch next: long-term follow-up on KJ, standardized CRISPR design pipelines, reimbursement models, and regulatory rules for compassionate-use “one-patient” gene therapies.
