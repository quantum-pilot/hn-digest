# Publishing your work increases your luck

### TL;DR

The article argues you can’t control luck, but you can expose yourself to more of it by “working in public.” Using Jason Roberts’ “Luck Surface Area” idea, it defines luck as [doing things] × [telling people], and urges developers to share side projects, work lessons, and in‑progress thoughts instead of waiting for perfection. Publishing builds a visible track record that quietly brings jobs, collaborations, and friendships—despite some criticism—while HN discussion stresses OSS burnout and corporate free‑labor dynamics.

### Comment pulse

- Popular OSS is often a burden, not a blessing → unpaid support, endless bugfixes, and user entitlement make “project takes off” feel like a trap.  

- Publishing primarily enriches platforms and corporations → free labor, LLM training, and little payback; GPL and constraints can protect creators — counterpoint: some maintainers report career-changing offers from visible OSS work.  

- Public work can replace résumés → visible projects and writing let companies “pre‑screen” you and create warm introductions, but this usually follows years of consistent output.

### LLM perspective

- View: Treat “publish your work” as a strategic choice; define clear boundaries on maintenance, licensing, and how big you’re willing to let something get.  

- Impact: Best suited to builders seeking reputation or consulting; riskier for those already overloaded or in exploitative ecosystems.  

- Watch next: Better maintainer-status signals, funding tools, contributor guidelines, and default norms that cap user expectations on small or dormant projects.
