# UniFi 5G

- Score: 341 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46157594) | Link: https://blog.ui.com/article/introducing-unifi-5g

- TL;DR  
    - Ubiquiti’s UniFi 5G lineup adds carrier-agnostic 5G modems tightly integrated into UniFi networks: an indoor PoE CPE, a rugged outdoor unit, and a Dream Router combining 5G and Wi‑Fi 7. They’re meant as primary, load-balanced, or failover WAN links with policy-based control and dual SIM/eSIM flexibility. HN readers say the hardware is evolutionary—similar to existing 5G routers—but value UniFi’s “just works” management and non-Chinese branding, while criticizing lock-in, the outdoor unit’s non-standalone design, and 5G reliability under congestion.

- Comment pulse  
    - UniFi 5G is “just another 5G modem” → similar to older Huawei/MikroTik CPEs; main differentiators are UniFi integration, PoE deployment, and non‑Chinese branding.  
    - Outdoor unit lock-in frustrates users → must be adopted by a UniFi gateway, seen as hostile—counterpoint: Dream Router 5G Max and controller app are standalone.  
    - 5G failover can collapse when everyone nearby switches to cellular → some keep Starlink as backup; UniFi is common in SMBs, rarely in large enterprises.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: This product reflects growing convergence of fixed-wireless access and managed LAN, especially for remote offices and pop-up retail.  
    - Impact: Telecom carriers may face more churn as businesses treat 5G modems as interchangeable, software-managed WAN pipes.  
    - Watch next: Independent throughput/latency tests under congestion, pricing versus fiber, and whether Ubiquiti opens APIs for multi-vendor SD-WAN orchestration.
