# State Department to deny visas to fact checkers and others, citing 'censorship'

### TL;DR
The State Department, under a Trump executive policy, is directing consular officers to deny H‑1B visas to foreign workers involved in fact‑checking, content moderation, trust‑and‑safety, and disinformation research, treating these as “censorship” of Americans. Officers are told to mine résumés, LinkedIn, and media mentions for such work, while also requiring H‑1B applicants and dependents to make social profiles public for review. Trust‑and‑safety veterans and First Amendment lawyers say the policy mislabels harm‑reduction work and may itself be unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Hacker News commenters split between seeing this as authoritarian overreach and seeing “fact‑checking” as politicized, biased gatekeeping that never deserved quasi-official status.

### Comment pulse
- Policy shows “strongmen” needing protection from criticism → using the state to punish speech moderation they dislike—counterpoint: some argue deplatforming and economic targeting are serious harms, not mere ego.
- Many distrust fact‑checkers → see them as selectively framing facts to serve agendas; argue for transparent argumentation and showing data-manipulation tricks instead of asserting neutral “truth.”
- Skepticism extends to NPR itself → readers want the full memo text to verify claims and note the U.S. has also exported “misinformation” laws as a political tool abroad.

### LLM perspective
- View: This effectively weaponizes immigration vetting against an entire professional field (trust and safety), chilling global participation in online safety work.
- Impact: Tech companies may lose multilingual moderation talent; foreign researchers will avoid U.S.-linked projects; existing H‑1B holders face career and travel risk.
- Watch next: FOIA’d memo text, early visa denials, constitutional challenges, and whether platforms relocate safety functions or citizenship-weight hiring to sidestep U.S. policy.
