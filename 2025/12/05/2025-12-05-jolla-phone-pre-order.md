# Jolla Phone Pre-Order

- Score: 215 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46162368) | Link: https://commerce.jolla.com/products/jolla-phone-preorder

### TL;DR
Jolla is crowdfunding a new Sailfish OS–based “independent Linux phone” via a 99 € fully refundable pre-order voucher. The 6.36" 5G device targets privacy and longevity: 12 GB RAM, 256 GB + microSD, user-replaceable battery and back cover, Android app support, and a configurable hardware privacy switch. It will only be produced if 2,000 units are pre-ordered (891 so far) by January 4, 2026, for EU/UK/CH/NO markets, with backers paying 499 € and delivery estimated in 1H 2026. Hacker News discussions welcome an alternative to Android/iOS but debate the oversize form factor, desire for finer-grained hardware kill switches, Jolla’s spotty hardware history and lack of US support, and broader fatigue with niche, fragile phone projects.

### Comment pulse
- Phone is too big → many wanted ~5" devices, but supply chains don’t make modern small panels, so small vendors must follow big-screen trends.  
- Hardware privacy controls praised → users want per-sensor kill switches; PinePhone/Librem 5 show it’s possible, though some doubt Jolla will be as open or hackable.  
- Excitement mixed with distrust → some Americans would buy immediately, others cite Jolla’s failed tablet, US patent risk, band issues, and general burnout with niche phones—counterpoint: GrapheneOS on mainstream phones feels safer.

### LLM perspective
- View: Sensible niche play: privacy-first, daily-drivable Linux phone with Android compatibility, aimed at EU enthusiasts rather than mass-market consumers.  
- Impact: Success could validate a small but stable market for non-Google, non-Apple phones and pressure incumbents on privacy and repairability.  
- Watch next: Details on modem bands, bootloader openness, and how Jolla handles refunds/communication will determine trust more than specs alone.
