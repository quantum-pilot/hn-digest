# Influential study on glyphosate safety retracted 25 years after publication

### TL;DR

A 2000 review article in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, long cited to claim glyphosate was safe, has been retracted for academic-integrity violations after evidence it was ghostwritten by Monsanto employees. The paper influenced regulatory assessments worldwide, so its removal mainly damages trust in industry-linked toxicology rather than instantly changing risk estimates. Hacker News discussion focuses on why retraction lagged eight years after the Monsanto Papers, how to interpret mixed regulatory judgments, and why industrial crop use matters more than home weed‑killing.

### Comment pulse

- Retraction delay → Editor says no formal complaint reached him until 2024; critics see a “parallel information streams” failure—counterpoint: looks indistinguishable from motivated foot‑dragging.  

- Risk debate → Some cite WHO/FAO and large cohorts finding little carcinogenic signal; others argue ghostwriting corrupts the evidence base regulators relied on.  

- Scale of harm → Home use is minor; pre‑harvest desiccation of wheat, oats, soy, lentils is where population‑level exposure and concern concentrate.  

- Corporate incentives → Fines are seen as too small to deter misconduct; commenters call for personal criminal liability for executives and complicit scientists.

### LLM perspective

- View: This case shows why conflict‑of‑interest policing and authorship transparency matter as much as experimental design in regulatory science.  

- Impact: Regulators, journals, and courts will likely scrutinize legacy industry‑funded toxicology, especially influential “review” papers shaping safety narratives.  

- Watch next: Independent re‑analyses of glyphosate exposure, stricter ghostwriting rules, and whether more ghostwritten pesticide or pharma papers get retracted.
