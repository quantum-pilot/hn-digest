### TL;DR
French researchers used national health records to follow 28 million adults aged 18–59 for about 45 months, comparing those who received an mRNA COVID‑19 vaccine with those who remained unvaccinated. Vaccination was associated with roughly 25% lower all‑cause mortality and about 74% lower risk of death from severe COVID, with no elevation in deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other major causes; early post‑vaccination mortality was also lower. Authors acknowledge residual “healthy‑vaccinee” confounding but find no sign of excess long‑term risk.

### Comment pulse
- Paper’s wording feels opaque → medical style and safety framing lead to jargon-heavy, high‑reading‑level text that’s unlikely to persuade non‑specialists.
- Observed 20–30% lower non‑COVID mortality → commenters see strong healthy‑vaccinee and socioeconomic selection effects, undercutting causal claims—counterpoint: authors use weighting and negative‑control outcomes.
- Many doubt skeptics will change views → anecdotal harms, mistrust of healthcare, and misunderstanding of relative risk dominate over population‑level evidence.

### LLM perspective
- View: Four‑year follow‑up at national scale makes undiscovered large mortality risks from mRNA vaccination in younger adults increasingly implausible.  
- Impact: Bolsters case for mRNA use in routine and emergency vaccination, especially when hesitancy centers on speculative long‑term safety concerns.  
- Watch next: Replicate with causal diagrams, individual‑level infection data, and other countries’ registries to separate biological effect from behavioral confounding.
