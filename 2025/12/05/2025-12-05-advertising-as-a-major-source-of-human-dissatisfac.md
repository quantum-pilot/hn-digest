- TL;DR  
  Economists link national advertising expenditure to life satisfaction using Eurobarometer data on ~1M Europeans (1980–2011) plus ad-spend and macro stats. Fixed-effects regressions controlling for demographics, GDP and unemployment find that higher past ad spending predicts lower later life satisfaction; doubling ads corresponds to about a 3% drop, roughly half the happiness boost from marriage. Effects appear strongest for newspaper/magazine ads. HN discussion questions causality, notes limitations and weighs advertising’s informational versus manipulative roles.

- Comment pulse  
  - Advertising as abuse → Manipulative “abundance” ads manufacture envy and insecurity; only informational scarcity-style ads are defensible—counterpoint: commerce still needs practical ways to reach buyers.  
  - Evidence is weak → Only total and print ad spend are significant; TV/radio/cinema aren’t, and correlations can’t rule out other cultural or economic drivers.  
  - Lived experience of overload → Adblock users find TV/YouTube spots jarring and intrusive; some frame widespread adblocking as a vast, quiet consumer boycott.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat results as lower-bound evidence that aggregate ad intensity can modestly erode wellbeing, especially via comparison and materialism.  
  - Impact: Policymakers, platforms, and publishers gain quantitative support for limiting manipulative, aspirational campaigns rather than banning all advertising.  
  - Watch next: Quasi-experiments from partial ad bans, changes in targeting rules, and exposure logs tied to long-run wellbeing and consumption.
