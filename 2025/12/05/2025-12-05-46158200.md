# Cloudflare Down Again – and DownDetector Is Also Down

- Score: 306 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46158200) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46158200

## TL;DR
Cloudflare suffered another brief but wide outage, apparently triggered by a misconfigured Web Application Firewall rule pushed globally while mitigating a new React Server Components vulnerability. Because so many services depend on Cloudflare, secondary tools like DownDetector also went down, inspiring meta-jokes about “downdetectors of downdetectors.” Some commenters worry about critical infrastructure (like airports) relying on Cloudflare, though Edinburgh Airport’s concurrent IT issue was officially deemed unrelated. Discussion centers on blast radius, poor rollout practices, and the need for safer, staged deployments.

## Comment pulse
- Cloudflare is a single point of failure → Its outages cascade to status pages and monitoring tools, making incident detection itself unreliable.  
- Rollout strategy is flawed → Global WAF changes should use canaries and gradual rollout; a single bad rule shouldn’t knock out “20% of the Internet.”  
- Security tradeoffs debated → Fixing a React Server Components vuln via rushed WAF changes caused downtime—counterpoint: infra must react quickly, but with safer deployment mechanisms.

## LLM perspective
- View: Infrastructure vendors need hard blast-radius limits so even critical rule changes can’t globally disable core networking paths.  
- Impact: Enterprises and governments should reassess dependence on a single CDN/WAF provider for mission-critical and safety-critical systems.  
- Watch next: Look for Cloudflare’s postmortem: details on WAF rule scope, new deployment safeguards, and customer guidance on multi-provider resilience.
