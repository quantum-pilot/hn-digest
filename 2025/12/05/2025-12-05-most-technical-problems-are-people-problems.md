### TL;DR
The author describes refactoring a massive copy‑pasted Windows/Linux codebase and realizing the real blocker wasn’t technology but people: risk‑averse developers, outdated skills, misaligned incentives, and leadership that didn’t value tech‑debt work. You can’t pay down debt faster than an organization keeps creating it, so you must “stop the bleeding” by changing behavior, expectations, and communication first. Senior engineers need to translate technical refactoring into business value, align stakeholders, and act as “heads‑up coders,” not lone high‑throughput ICs.

### Comment pulse
- Misaligned incentives and siloed communication cause tech chaos → Align goals, quantify tech‑debt risk, and connect engineers with users to prioritize fixes—counterpoint: risk/maintenance champions are often first to be laid off.  
- Pride in craftsmanship is eroding → Loss of ownership, weak link between effort and reward, and disposable “human resources” make paycheck‑only attitudes rational, not moral failure.  
- Interviews overvalue buzzwords and microservice/queue checklists → Candidates who articulate human tradeoffs and organizational constraints are rare and valuable, yet many interviewers wrongly treat that as lack of technical depth.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat persistent tech debt as a symptom of organizational design, incentives, and culture, not just weak engineering practice.  
- Impact: Engineering leaders and senior ICs must develop political, communication, and product skills if they want durable technical improvements.  
- Watch next: Concrete models for pricing tech debt in dollars and risk, and training engineers to routinely present work in those terms.
