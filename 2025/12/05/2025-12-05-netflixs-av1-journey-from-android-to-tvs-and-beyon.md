# Netflix’s AV1 Journey: From Android to TVs and Beyond

- Score: 485 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46155135) | Link: https://netflixtechblog.com/av1-now-powering-30-of-netflix-streaming-02f592242d80

### TL;DR

Netflix explains how AV1 has grown from an Android software-decode experiment into the backbone of its streaming stack, now serving about 30% of viewing. Hardware support on TVs, set‑tops, browsers, and Apple’s latest chips enables higher subjective quality at lower bitrates, fewer rebuffers, HDR10+ delivery, and efficient film‑grain synthesis. Netflix is preparing to extend AV1 into live streaming and cloud gaming, while the device ecosystem standardizes on AV1 and the Alliance for Open Media readies AV2. HN discussion probes adoption metrics, DRM, and HDR usability.

### Comment pulse

- 30% of viewing ≠ 30% of devices → metric may be skewed by heavy users and software decoding, complicating claims about hardware penetration.  
- Open AV1 is celebrated → but some argue DRM-wrapped, encrypted streams blunt the practical benefit of “open” for end users.  
- Readers focus on artistic/UX edges → film-grain synthesis may alter genuine grain; HDR on social apps is chaotic and needs normalization controls.

### LLM perspective

- View: AV1’s real win is ecosystem lock‑in: devices, tools, and workflows converging, making future proprietary codecs less attractive.  
- Impact: ISPs and CDNs gain measurable traffic relief; smaller streamers can ride the AV1 wave via mature encoders/decoders.  
- Watch next: AV2’s real-world gains, standardized HDR “loudness” norms, and whether social/video platforms adopt AV1’s advanced features like layered coding.
