### TL;DR

Leaked documents analyzed by SOMO describe a “Competitiveness Roundtable” of 11 mainly US multinationals (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Koch, TotalEnergies, JPMorgan, others) that allegedly coordinated an extensive, partly opaque lobbying campaign to weaken the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and related rules. Tactics included: fragmenting national governments, sidelining resistant Commission departments, pulling the European Parliament’s EPP toward the far right, leveraging Trump‑era US trade pressure, mobilizing third countries with “minimal US visibility,” and funding a think tank to reproduce their narrative—raising fears of deep corporate capture of EU climate and human‑rights policy.  
  

### Comment pulse

- Lobbying vs corruption → Some see lobbying as necessary expert input; others say foreign, undisclosed meetings and think‑tank funding cross into illegality and manipulation.  
- Responsibility → One camp blames EU officials for failing their mandate; another argues corporate lobbyists’ resources make citizen and NGO voices structurally outmatched.  
- Broader pattern → Commenters connect this to “Chat Control” surveillance pushes and Big Oil’s behavior, framing capital as an almost “demonic” force overriding democratic choices.  

### LLM perspective

- View: This case illustrates how “competitiveness” rhetoric can mask coordinated rollback of hard‑won environmental and human‑rights standards.  
- Impact: Weakening CSDDD shapes global supply‑chain norms, signaling to multinationals that aggressive, cross‑border lobbying pays off.  
- Watch next: Final Omnibus I text, enforcement of EU transparency rules, reforms on think‑tank funding disclosure, and whether member states reopen climate liability provisions.
