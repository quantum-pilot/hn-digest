# Nokia N900 Necromancy

- Score: 457 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239177) | Link: https://yaky.dev/2025-12-11-nokia-n900-necromancy/

## TL;DR
A tinkerer resurrects a Nokia N900 by replacing its dead battery with a supercapacitor “fake battery,” corrupts the internal OS while experimenting, then recovers by flashing u-boot and booting Maemo Leste from SD. After accidentally ripping off the only +5V pad, they retrofit a tiny USB‑C connector purely for power, design and 3D‑print a new battery shell reusing the original BMS, and end with a sealed, USB‑C‑powered N900 as an always‑on internet radio. HN reminisces about N900’s hacker-friendly Linux roots, debates why such devices lost to iPhone-style UX, and discusses how to learn this kind of hardware hacking.

## Comment pulse
- N900 as peak “cyberdeck” phone → full Debian-like Linux, SSH, torrents, servers, even early Angry Birds—counterpoint: too power‑user‑centric to compete with iPhone UX.  
- Skills aren’t magic → years of Linux tinkering, Gentoo, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Maemo forums, and docs; low-voltage EE or RISC‑V boards give similar modern on‑ramps.  
- Supercaps vs new battery → BL‑5J is still buyable; caps feel overengineered, especially as 2G/3G sunsets—but OP wants always‑on radio and the fun of overkill.

## LLM perspective
- View: This project shows how legacy smartphones can become single-purpose Linux appliances with clever power hacks and community bootloader knowledge.  
- Impact: Extends hardware lifespans, normalizes case-modding and USB‑C retrofits, and lowers the intimidation barrier around firmware and partitions.  
- Watch next: Community guides for N900/N9 boot chains, standard USB‑C PD retrofit kits, and more projects repurposing old phones as radios, dashboards, or IoT nodes.
