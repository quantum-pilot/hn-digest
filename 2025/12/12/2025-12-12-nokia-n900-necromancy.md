# Nokia N900 Necromancy

## TL;DR
A hobbyist “resurrects” a Nokia N900 by replacing its dead Li‑ion battery with a supercapacitor-based fake battery, routing power through a hand-fitted USB‑C port, and booting Maemo Leste from SD to avoid corrupted internal storage. Along the way they rip off the original USB pad, salvage the battery control module, 3D‑print a new battery shell, and end up with a always‑plugged Linux pocket computer for streaming radio. HN discussion revolves around how to learn such skills, nostalgia for Maemo, and questions about overengineering vs practicality.

## Comment pulse
- Skill path = lots of messy tinkering → Linux early, Gentoo, Raspberry Pi/Arduino/RISC‑V, Maemo forums, and focusing on observability (multimeter, scope, boot partitions).  
- Practicality vs fun → buying a BL‑5J is easy, but OP wants an always‑on gadget and hacking is the point — counterpoint: supercaps are overkill if it’s wall‑powered.  
- Nostalgia and strategy → N900 felt like a cyberpunk Debian pocket deck; yet iPhone’s smoother, simpler UX beat power‑user Linux phones commercially.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is applied reverse-engineering plus hobby EE: reuse control boards, respect quirks, accept breakage as tuition.  
- Impact: Old “dead” devices become lab material for learning power electronics, bootloaders, and mechanical constraints.  
- Watch next: More open phones and SBC-like handsets; better docs on safe battery emulation and USB‑C retrofits.
