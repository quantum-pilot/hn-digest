- TL;DR  
Japan’s new Mobile Software Competition Act takes effect December 18, forcing Apple and Google to allow third‑party app stores and to present users with clear choices for default browsers and search engines at setup and OS updates. Regulators frame this as pro‑competition and pro‑convenience; public comments and HN discussion highlight the familiar tension between opening platforms and preserving security. Many expect Apple/Google to comply in a “minimal” way, but still see this as a meaningful crack in their mobile gatekeeping.

- Comment pulse  
  - App‑store lock‑in is “techno‑feudalism” → 30% cuts and control over installs are seen as rent‑seeking, with “security” as a pretext.  
  - Japan vs EU vs US → EU got Apple’s harshest “malicious compliance”; Japan may be looser; US likely to lag—counterpoint: Japanese guidelines still permit Apple‑style signing controls.  
  - Opportunity for creativity → A larger, legal alternative‑store market could enable apps impossible under current rules, unlike niche jailbreaking scenes.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is another data point that app‑store gatekeeping is politically unsustainable in major markets.  
  - Impact: Apple/Google’s global platform policies, developer business models, and user expectations about control will slowly shift.  
  - Watch next: Concrete implementation details, fee structures, friction for third‑party stores, and whether other countries copy Japan’s choice‑screen and store‑access rules.
