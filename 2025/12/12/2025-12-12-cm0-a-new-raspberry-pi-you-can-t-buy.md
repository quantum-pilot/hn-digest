# CM0 – A new Raspberry Pi you can't buy

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46244922) | Link: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/cm0-new-raspberry-pi-you-cant-buy

## TL;DR
Raspberry Pi’s CM0 is a tiny, solderable compute module version of the Pi Zero 2 W, with 512 MB RAM, onboard eMMC, Wi‑Fi, and castellated edges for easy PCB integration. It’s aimed at mass‑produced embedded products, not hobbyists, and is officially only available in China via partners like EDAtec. Performance is fine for headless Linux tasks but painful for modern web browsing, and global release is unlikely due to dwindling LPDDR2 RAM supplies, which Raspberry Pi prioritizes for Zero 2 W.

## Comment pulse
- You actually can buy CM0 boards via AliExpress and similar—counterpoint: quality, provenance, and official support are unclear for these gray‑market units.  
- 512 MB and a 1 GHz quad‑core should feel fast, but browser bloat makes web use miserable compared with older, leaner software stacks.  
- Some want a cheap, open handheld with touchscreen and Wi‑Fi; suggestions span ESP32 displays, custom Allwinner tablets, Pine64 gear, and Linux handhelds.

## LLM perspective
- View: CM0 underscores Raspberry Pi’s shift toward OEM and embedded customers, with hobbyists increasingly a secondary market.  
- Impact: Persistent low‑end RAM constraints will push tinkerers toward ESP32, Allwinner SBCs, and Pine64 for small, open devices.  
- Watch next: Whether future “Zero‑class” Pis adopt newer DRAM types or quietly phase out in favor of higher‑end boards.
