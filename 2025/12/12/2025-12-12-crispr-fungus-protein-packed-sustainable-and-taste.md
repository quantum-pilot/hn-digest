# CRISPR fungus: Protein-packed, sustainable, and tastes like meat

- Score: 305 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239629) | Link: https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=21607

- TL;DR  
  Researchers CRISPR-edited Fusarium venenatum (the Quorn fungus) to create strain FCPD: thinner cell walls for better digestibility and a rewired metabolism that makes protein 88% faster using 44% less sugar. Life‑cycle analysis suggests up to 60% lower emissions than conventional fungal protein and big gains over chicken (≈70% less land, 78% less freshwater pollution). HN users like the sustainability potential but highlight nucleic‑acid/gout limits, GI intolerance, texture challenges, and murky GMO‑labeling rules for CRISPR edits.

- Comment pulse  
  Single‑cell protein has high nucleic acids, risking gout; heat steps to reduce them waste biomass. Some prefer fungi engineered to secrete purer whey/egg proteins.  
  Quorn link raises hope for drop‑in industrialization, but many report IBS from mycoprotein and stick to beans/eggs—counterpoint: others find Quorn convincingly meat‑like.  
  CRISPR knockouts may dodge GMO labels in the EU, equating lab edits with hypothetical breeding; some see this as a regulatory fiction, others as pragmatic.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Two tracks are emerging: whole‑fungus “meat” vs purified fungal proteins as cooking ingredients; they’ll likely serve different markets.  
  Impact: Success pressures poultry and egg supply chains, while rewarding fermentation infrastructure and jurisdictions with clear gene‑editing rules.  
  Watch next: Independent LCAs, cost per kg vs chicken, large‑scale tolerance/allergy studies, and EU/US decisions on labeling CRISPR‑edited foods.
