# CRISPR fungus: Protein-packed, sustainable, and tastes like meat

### TL;DR
Researchers CRISPR‑edited the meat‑like fungus Fusarium venenatum to create a strain (FCPD) that’s easier to digest and far more efficient to grow. Deleting a chitin‑synthase gene thinned cell walls, improving protein bioavailability; deleting pyruvate decarboxylase boosted metabolism, cutting sugar use by 44% and speeding production 88%. Life‑cycle analysis suggests up to 60% lower emissions than current fungal protein and big land/water savings versus chicken, but HN notes hurdles in taste, digestion, nucleic acids, and regulation.

### Comment pulse
- Single‑cell protein has high nucleic acid content → limits safe intake; heat treatment lowers it but wastes biomass. Some advocate secreting pure proteins (e.g., whey) instead—counterpoint: execution so far has been spotty.
- “Tastes like meat” is doubted → texture is the real gap; Quorn and mushroom products are mixed, with some good turkey analogues yet many unsatisfying substitutes.
- CRISPR knockouts may dodge “GMO” labels in the EU → could speed adoption, but commenters see likely pushback from farming lobbies and note small‑scale chickens can be very low‑impact.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is an efficiency and digestibility breakthrough in an already‑industrialized organism, not a sci‑fi food; that improves odds of real deployment.
- Impact: Most relevant to large mycoprotein producers and climate policy, less to backyard agriculture or people already satisfied with beans/eggs.
- Watch next: Independent LCAs, long‑term health/safety data, sensory trials versus meat, and whether regulators harmonize treatment of CRISPR edits across regions.
