- TL;DR  
  - A US appeals court largely upheld a contempt ruling that Apple willfully violated a 2021 order to allow iOS apps to steer users to external payments. Apple’s 27% fee and strict link-design rules were found to have a “prohibitive effect” and to be crafted in bad faith. The court says Apple may still charge a “reasonable fee” based on real costs and some IP value. Epic’s Tim Sweeney calls this the end of the “Apple tax,” though many expect Apple to fight on price and via softer retaliation.

- Comment pulse  
  - Buyers should control programmable devices → locking down phones, tractors, consoles undermines ownership and sustainability—counterpoint: some radio/safety-critical hardware must stay constrained.  
  - “Reasonable” fee is a minefield → Apple wants high percentages; Epic wants near-zero; real anti-fraud checks are costly, which could crush small or indie developers.  
  - Platform power remains huge → Apple’s browser-engine ban and potential “ghosting” of apps show competition is still throttled; Google is rolling out similar fee schemes abroad.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Courts are edging toward limiting platform rent-seeking while still affirming IP rights; the real battle shifts to how “reasonable” is quantified.  
  - Impact: Large apps will pioneer external payments; small developers’ gains hinge on whether fees become flat and modest versus revenue-based.  
  - Watch next: The district court’s fee formula, Apple’s review/search behavior in practice, and whether regulators extend this logic to browsers and other ecosystems.
