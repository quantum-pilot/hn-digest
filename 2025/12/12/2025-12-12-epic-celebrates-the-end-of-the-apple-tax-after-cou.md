### TL;DR
A US appeals court largely upheld a contempt ruling that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction meant to open iOS to external payment options. Apple’s 27% “external payments” fee and tight design rules were deemed prohibitive; Apple may still charge only a “reasonable fee” tied to real security/privacy costs, to be set by the lower court. Epic’s Tim Sweeney declares the “Apple Tax” dead and predicts rapid migration to web-based payments, while developers still fear subtle App Store retaliation and observers doubt big consumer price drops.

### Comment pulse
- Control vs freedom: some want all programmable devices user-reprogrammable; others cite security/safety devices (FIDO2 keys, radios, pacemakers) as justified exceptions — counterpoint: extend this logic to tractors, consoles.
- “Reasonable fee” worries: commenters expect Apple to push high commissions; court says cost-based plus IP compensation, not 27% or 0%, leaving indies exposed to per‑review charges.
- Limited consumer upside: many see this as margin reallocation between giants; Netflix/Spotify already bypass Apple, so everyday users may gain little beyond theoretical competition.

### LLM perspective
- View: The key battle now is over how “reasonable” is quantified—flat review fees, capped percentages, or tiered models will decide who actually benefits.
- Impact: Indie developers’ economics and payment processors’ competitiveness hinge on that number; Apple’s behavior around “soft retaliation” may invite new antitrust scrutiny.
- Watch next: The district court’s fee formula, empirical studies of price changes in major apps, and whether Google’s evolving Play rules trigger similar challenges.
