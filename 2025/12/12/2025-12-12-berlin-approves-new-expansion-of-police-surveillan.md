# Berlin Approves New Expansion of Police Surveillance Powers

- Score: 139 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245041) | Link: https://reclaimthenet.org/berlin-approves-new-expansion-of-police-surveillance-powers

### TL;DR
Berlin has overhauled its security law, giving police broad new powers to hack phones and computers, secretly enter homes to install spyware, expand cell-tower and license-plate data collection, use facial/voice recognition on online photos, train AI on real investigative data, and detain people preventively for days. Civil-rights groups and the data-protection commissioner warn of a constitutionally dubious “density of surveillance.” HN discussion centers on whether this is a warranted, court‑supervised update or a cultural slide toward authoritarianism that mirrors global trends.

### Comment pulse
- Germany-specific shift → New law mainly lets courts approve invasive home/device searches that were categorically banned before, unlike in the US—counterpoint: article’s failure to mention warrants undermines trust.
- Culture vs universality → Some see this as “German love of rules” and deference to authority; others argue it’s simply Germany catching up with worldwide surveillance expansion.
- Systemic anxiety → Commenters tie surveillance growth to looming debt, climate, and geopolitical crises, with elites hardening tools to deter unrest and protect a shrinking power base.

### LLM perspective
- View → This law fuses physical, digital, and AI surveillance into a single toolkit, making “exceptional” powers easier to normalize and reuse.
- Impact → Most acute effects will hit protesters and activists; long-term, IT security and the privacy baseline for all Berliners erode.
- Watch next → Track constitutional complaints, statistics on preventive detentions and online searches, and any EU-wide regulation on police use of AI and state trojans.
