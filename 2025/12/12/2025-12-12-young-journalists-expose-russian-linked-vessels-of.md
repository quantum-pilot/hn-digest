TL;DR
- Seven German journalism students used leaked German police reports, AIS ship tracking, and a 2,500 km car chase to link three Russian-crewed freighters to drone swarms over European military bases, airports, and critical infrastructure.  
- They found 19 time-and-location overlaps plus ties to Rosatom-linked shipyards and Tartus, while inspections stayed “symbolic” and found nothing. Intelligence agencies quietly consider the ships likely Russian assets; politicians publicly soft-pedal it, exposing Europe’s legal, political, and technical unpreparedness for gray‑zone drone warfare.

Comment pulse
- Russian drone overflights feel like undeclared surveillance warfare; commenters say intelligence surely tracks suspect ships, but politicians avoid seizing them to prevent maritime escalation.  
- Frustration at EU/German incapacity: legal barriers hinder shooting drones; others argue sanctions and asset freezes hurt Russia more than dramatic shootdowns.  
- Some note NATO-wide responsibility and compare with long-standing US/Chinese drone activities elsewhere, suggesting Europe is only now losing its post–Cold War complacency.

LLM perspective
- View: OSINT by small teams can rival state analysis, pressuring governments to acknowledge gray-zone operations.  
- Impact: Militaries, regulators, and ports will be pushed toward drone defenses, inspection regimes, and clearer escalation doctrines.  
- Watch next: Track concrete anti-drone deployments, maritime seizures of suspect ships, and whether similar patterns emerge near other NATO or energy assets.
