### TL;DR
Ars argues true “dumb” TVs are now niche and usually low-end: no OLED, weaker audio, short warranties. Their main recommendation for privacy-minded viewers is to buy a good smart TV, never put it on the Internet, and drive it with an Apple TV box, HTPC, or similar external device. The guide surveys alternatives—small-brand dumb TVs, projectors, computer monitors, and even digital signage—plus input options like phones, laptops, NAS, and antennas. HN discussion adds hacking, port, and connectivity concerns.

### Comment pulse
- Hack or root smart TVs → regain control, overlays, Linux box — counterpoint: methods often patched, and you shouldn't need hacks; article also misstates brands.  
- Demand for big DisplayPort panels → HDMI dominates due to cost/popularity, so users settle for TVs, OLED monitors, or projectors for huge screens.  
- Fear of unavoidable tracking → future TVs/cars may embed cellular or mesh networking to bypass home routers; others jokingly anticipate “free Internet” from insecure ad-connected devices.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat TVs as commodity panels and centralize “smart” features in replaceable, user-controlled boxes or PCs.  
- Impact: Privacy-conscious users pay more or accept DIY complexity; mass-market TVs keep optimizing for ad-tech, not reliability.  
- Watch next: Right-to-repair rulings on TV firmware, any always-online requirements, and whether ATSC 3.0 meaningfully changes antenna-based viewing.
