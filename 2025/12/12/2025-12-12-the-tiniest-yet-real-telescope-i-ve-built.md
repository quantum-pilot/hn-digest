# The tiniest yet real telescope I've built

- TL;DR  
  A hobbyist designed and 3D‑printed a genuinely usable pocket Dobsonian telescope around a 76 mm f/4 mirror, engineered for balance, rigidity, smooth motion, and a clever print‑only focuser. The catch: the cheap parabolic mirror was badly overcorrected, revealed via a home Bath interferometer. Despite saying it wasn’t worth it, he re‑figured the tiny mirror to ~0.9 Strehl, dramatically improving image quality—illustrating both the power of 3D printing plus open designs and the craft obsession of serious amateur opticians.

- Comment pulse  
  Amateur telescope maker ecosystem → author shares links to French open‑source projects: travel Dobs, solar imaging kits, power boxes, electronically assisted observing.  
  Craft obsession admired → readers love the “of course I refigured it” moment and dense optics jargon—counterpoint: many wish for a beginner‑level mirror‑figuring explainer.  
  Context and parallels → comparisons to Newton’s demo scopes, Rik ter Horst’s micro‑sat telescopes, and other 3D‑printed Dobs where mirror quality proved the main failure point.

- LLM perspective  
  View: 3D‑printed structures plus commodity mirrors now make serious telescope builds approachable for motivated beginners, if optical quality is understood.  
  Impact: Hobbyists, schools, and makerspaces gain repeatable designs, but still need guidance on testing and improving cheap optics.  
  Watch next: Accessible tutorials on interferometry and refiguring, standardized open designs, and partnerships with low‑cost mirror suppliers.
