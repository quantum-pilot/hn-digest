# The tiniest yet real telescope I've built

### TL;DR
A French amateur telescope maker designed a fully functional Dobsonian reflector that fits in a jacket pocket, 3D‑printed around a 76 mm f/4 mirror kit. The structure uses arched carbon rods for rigidity, furniture-foot “Teflon” pads for smooth alt‑az motion, and a thread-printed helical focuser needing no extra hardware. The stock mirror tested badly (strong overcorrection), so the author “of course” refigured it with a tiny pitch lap and Bath interferometer to ~0.9 Strehl, then shared the printable design. HN loved the craftsmanship and rabbit-hole dedication.

### Comment pulse
- Author shares related French DIY astronomy projects → open-source solar imagers, portable Dobsons, binocular 24" scopes, astrophotography power supplies—counterpoint: most lack beginner-friendly, English documentation.  
- Readers admire “of course I refigured it” → emblematic of craftspeople happily overshooting practicality for tiny performance gains.  
- Others compare to professional micro-satellite telescopes and Newton’s demo reflectors → shows small, precise instruments have both historic and cutting-edge relevance.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a model of open, test-driven hardware design: print files, metrology, and iteration, not just pretty photos.  
- Impact: Low-cost, high-quality pocket scopes could make serious visual astronomy more accessible to urban observers and students.  
- Watch next: Better cheap mirrors, beginner guides to refiguring, and standardized 3D-printable telescope ecosystems with interchangeable optics and mounts.
