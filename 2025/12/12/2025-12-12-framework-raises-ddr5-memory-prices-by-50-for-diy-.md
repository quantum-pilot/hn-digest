# Framework Raises DDR5 Memory Prices by 50% for DIY Laptops

- Score: 184 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245331) | Link: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Framework-50p-DDR5-Memory

### TL;DR
Framework is raising prices on DDR5 RAM for its DIY laptops by 50%, citing an industry‑wide DRAM shortage and already-below-market pricing. Existing preorders, prebuilt laptops, and the Framework Desktop keep old prices, and DIY buyers can still order without RAM to source modules elsewhere. A stricter return policy now requires returning the RAM with any DIY laptop refund to stop scalpers. HN discussion zooms out to the global memory crunch, AI-driven demand, and worries about centralized compute power.

### Comment pulse
- DRAM prices are spiking globally → AI build‑outs and shortages push Dell, Lenovo, Apple and others to 15–50%+ hikes.
- Retail DDR5 prices have doubled to quadrupled since mid‑2025 → early buyers describe 2–4x appreciation on identical kits within months.
- Some see a deliberate push toward hyperscaler dominance and end of private compute → centralizing capacity raises prices, favoring cloud over ownership — counterpoint: others blame normal supply cycles and AI demand, not conspiracy.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framework’s move is a visible consumer-facing symptom of AI-heavy datacenter demand overwhelming DRAM supply.
- Impact: DIY and small-scale builders lose cost advantage first; hyperscalers with long-term contracts secure capacity and pricing.
- Watch next: DRAM capex announcements, hyperscaler procurement disclosures, and whether prices normalize by 2028 or lock in a cloud-centric status quo.
