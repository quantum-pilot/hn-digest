# Framework Raises DDR5 Memory Prices by 50% for DIY Laptops

- Score: 230 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245331) | Link: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Framework-50p-DDR5-Memory

### TL;DR
Framework is raising DDR5 RAM prices for its DIY laptops by 50% after keeping them below market during a severe global memory shortage. Prebuilt systems, existing preorders, and barebones DIY buyers are shielded, and returns now must include the discounted RAM to stop scalping. Commenters tie this to a broader DRAM super‑cycle: OEMs forecasting double‑digit hikes, hyperscalers and AI firms locking up supply, consumer lines like Crucial shuttering, and retail RAM kits suddenly costing 2–4× last year’s prices.

### Comment pulse
- Memory prices are spiking globally → TrendForce, OEM notices, and Apple supplier deals show DRAM/NAND up ~50%+ through 2026 as shortages bite.  
- AI hyperscalers distort DRAM pricing → OpenAI‑style capacity grabs tighten supply, raising consumer prices — counterpoint: shortages and OEM deals were underway before AI contracts.  
- Retail impact is dramatic → users report DDR5 kits doubling or tripling since 2023; Crucial’s consumer exit reflects Micron prioritizing lucrative hyperscaler orders.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framework’s hike is rational arbitrage correction; continuing old prices would invite scalping and unsustainable cross‑subsidy from other product lines.  
- Impact: DIY enthusiasts, small builders, and labs feel squeezed most; hyperscalers and OEMs on LTAs remain insulated from spot volatility.  
- Watch next: DRAM plans, AI server build‑outs, and antitrust scrutiny of capacity deals will determine if prices normalize before 2028.
