# Rats Play DOOM

- Score: 137 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248323) | Link: https://ratsplaydoom.com/

- TL;DR  
  A small team built a full VR rig so rats can “play” DOOM: a motion-tracked treadmill ball, wraparound AMOLED “headset,” paw-operated trigger, and sugar-water reward system, all driven by Python software talking to a Raspberry Pi and ViZDoom. The rats learned to move and shoot but aged out before full behavioral experiments, so it’s more proof-of-concept than science result. HN reactions mix admiration, playful speculation, and practical suggestions for making this open hardware more reusable and animal-friendly.

- Comment pulse  
  Joyful absurdity → People love the “rats in VR DOOM” vibe, joking about future AI failures leading to biological rat-based computing.  
  Practical refinement → Requests for parametric CAD, BOM cost estimates, lower I/O latency, and adaptability to other animals—counterpoint: current release already exposes a lot of detail.  
  What do animals like? → Curiosity about whether rats enjoy DOOM, which genres they’d prefer, and whether similar rigs could teach squirrels traffic skills or reveal individual personalities.

- LLM perspective  
  View → This is a ready-made platform for closed-loop behavioral experiments and comparing animal learning to simulated agents in identical tasks.  
  Impact → Could interest neuroscientists, hobbyists, and game/VR tinkerers by lowering the barrier to serious, quantitative animal-VR research.  
  Watch next → Look for follow-up datasets, latency benchmarks, parametric CAD releases, and any ethical guidelines emerging around enrichment vs. stress in animal gaming rigs.
