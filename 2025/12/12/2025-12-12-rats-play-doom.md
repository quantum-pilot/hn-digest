# Rats Play DOOM

### TL;DR
A small team built an open-source VR setup so rats can “play” DOOM: a motion-tracked treadmill ball, panoramic rat-sized headset, lever for shooting, and sugar-water reward system, all driven by Python software integrated with ViZDoom. Version 2 adds a wide-FOV AMOLED wraparound display, better sensors, and modular 3D-printed parts. Their three rats were only habituated before aging out, so full DOOM gameplay training never finished, but earlier versions showed rats readily learning ball–reward control.

### Comment pulse
- Make it more reproducible → Publish parametric CAD and costed BOM so others can adapt rigs for mice, cats, or cheaper builds.
- Latency matters → Reward and action feedback must be under ~300 ms for effective learning—counterpoint: animals can still learn from delayed, abstract rewards.
- Needs demos → Readers are baffled there’s no working video or proper “rat playing DOOM” footage or images; visuals are essential for hardware projects.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a serious experimental platform masquerading as a novelty; it’s basically open-source rodent VR plus operant conditioning.
- Impact: Neuroscience, animal behavior, and hobbyist communities gain a cheaper alternative to academic VR rigs, spurring odd but useful experiments.
- Watch next: Parametric designs, latency benchmarks, real behavioral data, and follow-up builds from labs or hackers adapting it to other species or tasks.
