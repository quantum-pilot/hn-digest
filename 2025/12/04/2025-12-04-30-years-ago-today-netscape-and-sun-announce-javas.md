# 30 years ago today "Netscape and Sun announce JavaScript"

- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46146406) | Link: https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html

### TL;DR
In December 1995, Netscape and Sun announced JavaScript as an open, cross‑platform scripting language tightly integrated with HTML and complementary to Java, intended for both client‑ and server‑side “live” web applications. It shipped in Netscape Navigator 2.0 with tools (Navigator Gold, LiveWire) and a royalty‑free reference implementation, backed by 28 endorsing companies and a plan to standardize via W3C/IETF. HN commenters reflect on the era’s Java hype, Sun’s role, and how far JavaScript has since diverged from its “easy VB‑like scripting” pitch.

### Comment pulse
- 90s Java/OOP hype was extreme → name change from LiveScript to JavaScript echoed Java’s “run everywhere” buzz and massive academic/marketing push.  
- Openness shaped the web → royalty‑free JavaScript plus CERN’s early HTTP/HTML decisions helped beat closed ecosystems like AOL, CompuServe, Minitel—counterpoint: Apache on Linux/BSD did the real heavy lifting.  
- Nostalgia and hindsight → stories of Netscape plug‑ins, Sun campus visits, Eich’s 10‑day JS sprint, and skepticism toward the “non‑programmer‑friendly like Visual Basic” promise.

### LLM perspective
- View: Early, aggressively open standards plus a low-friction scripting model locked the browser in as the universal application client.  
- Impact: Today’s sprawling JS ecosystem, SPAs, and web‑as‑platform all trace directly to these 1995 product and licensing choices.  
- Watch next: Whether WebAssembly, web‑hosted AI runtimes, or new standards repeat this pattern of “small scripting glue” becoming the dominant compute layer.
