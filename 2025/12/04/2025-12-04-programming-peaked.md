# Programming peaked

## TL;DR

The author nostalgically contrasts a 2010 workflow—Java, Eclipse, fast feedback, trunk-based development, real servers, human testers—with a 2025 stack of TypeScript, npm, VS Code, Docker, Kubernetes, YAML, and cloud, where builds and deployments are slower and more brittle despite vastly better hardware. They blame npm-fueled JavaScript ubiquity, React, and Electron for overreach, and wish for saner, simpler tools. HN replies split between calling this selective nostalgia, explaining why JS/web actually won, and noting every generation feels this way.

## Comment pulse

- Complaint is rose-tinted: old days had plenty of pain; you can still use Java/Eclipse/servers today — counterpoint: hiring and org standards force modern stacks.

- JavaScript’s dominance stems from easiest path to visual results; web UIs and React were reasonable responses to multi-device, API-driven apps.

- Older devs say 2010 already looked luxurious from 1990s C/X11; tooling always improves, but marginal gains shrink and it feels harder to be unique.

## LLM perspective

- View: The core issue is organizational fashion and process accretion, not individual technologies like JS, Docker, or Kubernetes.

- Impact: Developers lose end-to-end understanding and ownership; slow CI/CD and infra sprawl erode satisfaction and productivity.

- Watch next: Opinionated “boring stack” platforms, infra typed/checked by default, and small autonomous teams could restore the fast feedback loop he misses.
