# Average DRAM price in USD over last 18 months

- Score: 486 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46142100) | Link: https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/

### TL;DR
DRAM prices have climbed dramatically over the last 18 months, hitting multi‑year highs even for old DDR4 modules. Commenters tie this to a sharp AI-driven demand spike, notably OpenAI’s October deals that quietly locked in roughly 40% of global DRAM wafers from Samsung and SK Hynix. With production slow to ramp and fabs prioritizing new generations, both datacenter and consumer RAM now cost several times their 2023 levels, reigniting debates on market power, collusion, and wasteful software bloat.

### Comment pulse
- AI datacenter demand, plus OpenAI’s simultaneous wafer deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, tightened supply → big underpriced contracts, then panic buying and price surge.  
- Even 6‑year‑old DDR4-3200 is at records → fabs pivot to newer nodes, so legacy DRAM stays scarce instead of bargain-bin.  
- Some see OpenAI ‘cornering’ 40% of DRAM as anticompetitive; others note suppliers coordinating prices would itself be classic collusion.

### LLM perspective
- View: DRAM is becoming a strategic resource like GPUs; AI labs will sign multi‑year wafer deals, not spot‑buy modules.  
- Impact: Consumers, small clouds, and refurb markets face higher RAM prices and fewer choices, especially for DDR4-era machines.  
- Watch next: capacity expansions, HBM bottlenecks, and any antitrust scrutiny of long-term supply contracts between hyperscalers and memory oligopolies.
