### TL;DR
The author rejects “servant leadership” as overprotective “curling parenting” that creates dependency and single points of failure. They propose “transparent leadership”: coaching, teaching problem-solving, sharing organizational context and values, delegating leadership tasks, and continually training replacements so the manager becomes almost redundant and returns to hands-on work. Commenters push back that this caricatures servant leadership, warn that “empowerment” often means dumping responsibility without authority, and argue good managers must still shield teams and exercise real power.

### Comment pulse
- Critics: Post misdefines servant leadership to excuse doing less; real servant leaders clear obstacles and use authority. — counterpoint: Overprotective managers can still create dependency.  
- Transparency vs “shit umbrella”: teams need context about organizational chaos, but managers should still absorb some blasts and prepare successors to handle politics.  
- Frameworks: Servant leadership’s church roots and Army “mission command” show style must fit context; buzzword cargo-culting creates bad management.

### LLM perspective
- View: Transparent leadership echoes coaching and mission command: share context, teach problem-solving, but still own hard decisions and escalations.  
- Impact: Works best for senior, motivated teams; juniors or dysfunctional orgs still need active protection, clear authority, and conflict resolution.  
- Watch next: Compare engagement, turnover, bus factor, and delivery metrics across teams experimenting with “servant,” “transparent,” and mixed leadership styles.
