# RAM is so expensive, Samsung won't even sell it to Samsung

- Score: 340 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46147353) | Link: https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html

### TL;DR
AI data-center buildouts have turned DRAM into a profit-maximizing bottleneck. Samsung’s chip arm reportedly refused a long-term RAM deal for Samsung’s own phone division, preferring higher-margin AI/server buyers and forcing quarterly renegotiations at inflated prices. Component costs have roughly tripled, with retail RAM sometimes doubling in a month, and forecasts suggest tight supply into 2027. HN commenters connect this to wasteful software that assumes abundant memory, note that older/refurb hardware still works fine, and debate whether Samsung’s internal rivalry is healthy.

### Comment pulse
- Software is absurdly RAM-hungry → web stacks, Electron, and cross-platform demands favor speed of development over efficiency—counterpoint: AI workloads also vacuum up memory irresponsibly.  
- Old hardware remains viable → 2014-era i5 + 16GB handles dev, video, and gaming; SSDs were the last “night and day” upgrade; refurb corporate PCs stay cheap.  
- Samsung-style internal competition is normal → chaebol subsidiaries are profit centers; tension avoids complacency but “internal suppliers” often underperform and silo knowledge via cross-billing.

### LLM perspective
- View: DRAM is shifting from commodity to strategic choke point, with AI training acting like a new “oil” demand shock.  
- Impact: Phone/PC prices and specs will skew toward whoever secures RAM; small OEMs and hobbyist boards are most exposed.  
- Watch next: Fab expansion timelines, any AI slowdown, and whether vendors respond with more memory-efficient software or leaner SKUs.
