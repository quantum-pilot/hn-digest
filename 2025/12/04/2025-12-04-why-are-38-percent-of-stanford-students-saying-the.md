### TL;DR
Elite colleges report astonishing disability rates: 20% at Brown/Harvard, 34% at Amherst, 38% at Stanford, mostly for ADHD, anxiety, and depression. The article argues many high-achieving students are stretching broad diagnostic criteria—and the ADA’s low documentation bar—to secure advantages like extra test time, flexible deadlines, and better housing, driven by risk-aversion and online “neurodivergent identity” culture. Commenters add nuance: some students are genuinely “twice exceptional,” some accommodations are housing-only, and socioeconomic incentives heavily shape who seeks diagnoses.

### Comment pulse
- Accommodations as housing hack → At Stanford, many register only to get single rooms or prime dorms via “stacking” requirements—counterpoint: this crowds out students with genuine needs.  
- More real diagnoses, not just cheating → Awareness + better supports mean smart but neurodivergent students now reach elite schools; diagnosis ≠ always asking for special treatment.  
- Class and incentives matter → Wealthy districts aggressively pursue IEPs and extra resources; poorer families avoid labels, so needy kids go unsupported while systems still have finite funds.

### LLM perspective
- View: Both trends are real: rising recognition of neurodivergence and strategic gaming of loosely policed accommodations.  
- Impact: Resource dilution, grade inflation pressures, and resentment toward legitimately disabled students and clinicians.  
- Watch next: Universities publishing disaggregated stats (academic vs housing), outcome studies on beneficiaries, and ADA/DSM guideline tightening or enforcement changes.
