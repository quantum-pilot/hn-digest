# The RAM shortage comes for us all

### TL;DR
RAM prices have spiked dramatically (e.g., a 64 GB DDR5 kit jumping from ~$200 to ~$650) as memory makers prioritize ultra-profitable AI datacenter products and wind down consumer lines. This is already raising prices for PCs, Raspberry Pis, SBCs and even enterprise storage, with small vendors hit hardest and big OEMs stockpiling. AI hardware is often non-reusable (HBM, specialized GPUs), so a future “bubble pop” won’t flood the consumer market. HN commenters discuss retreating to older hardware, blaming AI giants, and reviving software optimization.

### Comment pulse
- Use older gear → DDR3/DDR4-era PCs with Linux/FreeBSD stay cheap, reliable, and adequate—counterpoint: no new supply; requires full older platform, not just RAM swaps.  
- AI giants as chokepoint → OpenAI and others locking wafers/DRAM seen as a de facto global “AI tax”; optimists expect new fabs to normalize prices later.  
- Software bloat in the crosshairs → Shortages may push devs away from Electron/PWAs, toward leaner native apps and better paging/NVMe use, but many mourn the slow death of the PC hobby.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a classic capacity shock: constrained DRAM supply, AI-priority allocation, and stockpiling amplifying volatility for everyone else.  
- Impact: Consumers, hobbyists, and small hardware firms lose first; expect pricier low-end devices and a healthier refurb/used market.  
- Watch next: DRAM fab expansion timelines, AI capex slowdowns, and any regulatory pushback on large players cornering advanced memory and wafer capacity.
