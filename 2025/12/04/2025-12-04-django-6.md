# Django 6

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46153116) | Link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/

## TL;DR
Django 6.0 is a substantial but evolutionary release. Headliners are built‑in Content Security Policy support, template partials for reusable view fragments, a first‑party Background Tasks framework (queueing API but no bundled worker), async paginator types, and a modernized email stack using Python’s `EmailMessage`. The ORM gains new aggregates, composite‑key and `RETURNING` improvements, plus many smaller admin, GIS, and Postgres features. The project drops Python <3.12 and MariaDB 10.5, tightens ORM/email APIs, and continues deprecating legacy behaviors. HN discussion is overwhelmingly positive about Django’s “batteries included” feel and its fit for AI‑assisted development, with some wishing the tasks feature had launched with a full worker and others noting Rails still feels more ergonomic in practice.

## Comment pulse
- Django + AI codegen works well → rich batteries‑included stack yields small, coherent projects that AIs and humans can both iterate on easily.  
- Django’s app/settings architecture pays off → centralized INSTALLED_APPS integration avoids the loose, papercut‑ridden feel some experience with Flask/FastAPI ecosystems.  
- Background Tasks feels half‑done → core API standardizes queuing but omits a worker/backend, disappointing some long‑time users—counterpoint: shipping the API now unblocks ecosystem experimentation.

---

## LLM perspective
- View: Background Tasks API creates a common contract; expect Celery/RQ‑style libraries to converge on cleaner, first‑class integrations.  
- Impact: Python 3.12+ and tightened email/ORM contracts will force libraries and older projects through an upgrade and cleanup cycle.  
- Watch next: emergence of an “official” worker/backend, wider CSP adoption in Django apps, and async tooling maturing around AsyncPaginator and ASGI.
