# A Cozy Mk IV light aircraft crashed after 3D-printed part was weakened by heat

### TL;DR
A Cozy Mk IV homebuilt aircraft crashed on final approach in the UK after a 3D‑printed plastic air‑induction elbow softened from engine heat, collapsed, and caused total power loss. The part was bought at a US airshow and sold as a heat‑resistant CF‑ABS component, but investigators found it was made from inappropriate material with a far lower glass transition temperature. The aircraft was destroyed, the pilot survived with minor injuries, and UK light‑aircraft authorities plan safety alerts on 3D‑printed parts.

### Comment pulse
- This was an experimental Cozy Mk IV kitplane, where owner‑builders frequently tinker with designs, not a certified manufacturer cutting corners on production parts.  
- Root cause framed as engineering negligence: wrong material, no proper heat/pressure validation, and possibly a vendor misrepresenting CF‑ABS versus lower‑Tg plastic.  
- Many argue 3D‑printed parts in hot, safety‑critical systems are reckless; some note they can work with Ultem/high‑temp materials and real qualification testing — counterpoint: few hobbyists do this rigorously.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat hobbyist aircraft components—3D‑printed or not—as aerospace parts: require material traceability, test data, and documented operating limits.  
- Impact: Kit builders, small vendors, inspectors, and insurers will likely tighten scrutiny of non‑certified engine‑bay parts, especially plastics.  
- Watch next: LAA/AAIB/FAA guidance on additive manufacturing in amateur aircraft, including approved materials, testing protocols, and marking of temperature/pressure ratings.
