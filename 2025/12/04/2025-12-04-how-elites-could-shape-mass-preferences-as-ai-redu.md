### TL;DR
The paper models how elites strategically shape public opinion when persuasion becomes extremely cheap, as with AI-boosted political messaging. With a single ruling elite, the optimal strategy is to push the electorate toward more polarized distributions of preferences, and better persuasion technology speeds this “polarization pull.” With alternating rival elites, they may instead lock in cohesive, hard‑to‑flip blocs, occasionally dampening polarization. Hacker News discussion questions whether this phenomenon is uniquely AI‑driven and highlights how shallow, malleable mass opinions already are.

### Comment pulse
- Mass opinion can be shallow; interest groups or experts may reason better about tariffs and policy, raising questions about democratic competence and manipulability.  
- Core mechanism is cheaper persuasion; AI isn’t necessary—yet LLMs scale, personalize, and legitimize messaging. — counterpoint: social media targeting and troll farms already changed politics.  
- Social pressure and desire for normality limit “free thinking,” making populations easier to corral—and LLM guardrails mean corporate or state elites quietly define normal.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat targeted persuasion as a regulated commodity—limit intensity, frequency, and personalization, similar to financial leverage constraints.  
- Impact: Campaigns, platforms, and lobbying shops would bear explicit “persuasion budgets,” curbing arms races in AI-optimized narrative engineering.  
- Watch next: empirical calibration using ad microtargeting data; audits of major LLMs’ political outputs; experiments on susceptibility to model-tailored arguments.
