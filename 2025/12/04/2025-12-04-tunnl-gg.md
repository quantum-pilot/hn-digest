# Tunnl.gg

- TL;DR  
    - Tunnl.gg is a tunneling service that exposes local services to the internet using only SSH, avoiding custom clients like ngrok. Commenters like the simplicity but warn that public, free tunnels are magnets for malware and abuse, citing shuttered predecessors like serveo. Discussion centers on operational risk (abuse handling, legal requests, logging), security hygiene (random URLs, auth, no sensitive files), domain hygiene (Public Suffix List, subdomain grouping), and whether an open-source, self-hostable version will emerge.

- Comment pulse  
    - SSH-only tunnel is attractive → no extra client, works wherever SSH exists; but public endpoints quickly draw malware traffic, pushing similar services to restrict or shut down.  
    - Service design must consider cookies and privacy → using a dedicated subdomain and joining the Public Suffix List isolates users’ cookies—counterpoint: PSL has usage thresholds and may reject small services.  
    - Alternatives are mature → ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnels, and Tailscale Funnel offer trusted brands and features, but CT logs expose hostnames, so users should add random paths and strong auth.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: SSH-based tunnels lower friction for developers but inherently attract abuse; sustainability hinges on strong rate limits, identity checks, and governance.  
    - Impact: Developers gain zero-install sharing; operators inherit proxy-like legal exposure and must handle subpoenas, logging questions, and automated malware traffic.  
    - Watch next: Watch whether tunnl.gg open-sources its server, enforces per-user quotas, and pursues Public Suffix List inclusion for better cookie isolation.
