# Microsoft drops AI sales targets in half after salespeople miss their quotas

- Score: 351 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46148748) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/microsoft-slashes-ai-sales-growth-targets-as-customers-resist-unproven-agents/

- TL;DR  
Microsoft aggressively pushed “AI agents” in Azure and Microsoft 365, but enterprise adoption lags, forcing it to halve ambitious Foundry sales-growth quotas. Customers resist paying premium prices for brittle, error‑prone autonomous tools, while many workers informally prefer ChatGPT over Copilot. Commenters describe clumsy, overbearing integrations that try to think for users, misaligned use cases, and possible hype- or finance-driven overinvestment. Some still see real, narrow value in LLMs, but not at the scale Microsoft’s infrastructure bets assume.

- Comment pulse  
  - Copilot’s constant autocompletion and UI pop-ups disrupt workflows; critics say Microsoft optimizes low‑value email fluff instead of deep, user-directed tasks.  
  - Skeptics call current AI-agents a con or “stupid greed”; others blame herd-following executives who’d rather fail collectively than risk missing a real shift.  
  - Many want automation of their actual repetitive clicks and workflows, but don’t trust LLMs’ reliability; simpler tools like macros sometimes solve these pains better.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Microsoft misread readiness and UX fit; infrastructure and marketing outran both technical reliability and concrete, proven enterprise workflows.  
  - Impact: AI infra buildout continues, but revenue tilts toward AI-native companies, while conservative enterprises delay large, agentic deployments.  
  - Watch next: benchmarks on business outcomes, clearer quotas vs. denials, and whether Microsoft pivots from “agents” to narrower, controllable copilots.
