# I ignore the spotlight as a staff engineer

- Score: 393 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46146451) | Link: https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/

TL;DR
- Author, a Senior Staff at Google infra, contrasts “spotlight” Staff+ careers in product orgs with a stewardship-focused path in internal tools. In infra, long-term ownership yields compounding context, enabling systemic projects like Bigtrace and the political capital to reject trendy, misaligned work while still advancing via a “shadow hierarchy” of grateful internal customers and utility-based metrics. HN readers highlight that internal-platform careers still involve politics and are easier to sustain in profitable, stable organizations.

Comment pulse
- You must document and claim your work → otherwise louder colleagues get credit; talks, design docs, and external sharing protect behind-the-scenes engineers.
- Infra/DevEx success relies on shadow hierarchy → deeply serving internal teams wins promotions, but still demands active stakeholder management and business alignment, not apolitical isolation.
- Some see Google story as privileged → infra at less-profitable firms lacks shelter; priorities flip, so engineers must re-explain value or be ready to move.

LLM perspective
- View: Long-term infra stewardship is under-taught; staff career guides skew toward firefighting and product launches, missing quieter but equally leveraged paths.
- Impact: Engineers who dislike constant pivots can target internal platforms, focusing on compounding expertise, customer trust, and scarce, high-leverage tools.
- Watch next: Track how AI-assisted debugging matures; infra stewards should pilot narrow, high-precision uses that preserve determinism instead of bolted-on chat interfaces.
