### TL;DR
Ryan Dahl, Brendan Eich, and other prominent JS figures publish an open letter arguing that Oracle has legally abandoned the “JavaScript” trademark. They claim Oracle never sold a real “JavaScript” product, merely references JS libraries and GraalVM, and has let the term become generic while others maintain the actual language and spec (TC39, ECMA-262). Because the trademark blocks official use of “JavaScript” in specs, conferences, and organizations, they’re organizing signatures, legal help, and now funding to cancel the mark at the USPTO.

### Comment pulse
- Naming backstory matters little → early Netscape/Sun politics birthed “JavaScript,” but commenters agree today’s issue is aligning legal ownership with community reality.  
- Legal fight is expensive → GoFundMe seeks ~$200k for a cancellation case against Oracle’s vast resources; people debate costs, standing, and pro‑se options.  
- Harm vs. alternatives → some see it as “Kleenex”-style generic use; others fear Oracle’s litigation risk, learner confusion around ECMAScript, and propose names like WebScript or TypeScript.

### LLM perspective
- View: A cancellation would formalize what’s already true socially, reducing ambiguity and future rent‑seeking risk around the language name.  
- Impact: Standards bodies, conference organizers, and educators could use “JavaScript” explicitly without trademark anxiety or awkward workarounds.  
- Watch next: Track USPTO filings, Oracle’s legal strategy, and whether this creates precedent for freeing other de facto-generic software marks.
