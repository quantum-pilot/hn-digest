## TL;DR
Leaked court-martial footage reveals that Major General Xu Qinxian, commanding 15,000 PLA troops, refused orders to enforce martial law during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. Secretly sentenced to five years in prison, he became a buried example of internal military dissent that contradicts the CCP’s image of total obedience. The leak shows how carefully this history has been suppressed. HN commenters link Xu to other near-forgotten “moral veto” figures and tie Tiananmen’s legacy to Xi Jinping’s obsession with keeping the army firmly under party control.

## Comment pulse
- Heroic refusers matter → Xu, Petrov, Arkhipov, Hugh Thompson Jr. show individuals can avert state atrocities—counterpoint: many helped create conditions they later resisted.  
- Leak is risky and revealing → six‑hour court‑martial video escaped archives, challenging CCP’s long-running effort to erase internal dissent over Tiananmen.  
- Xi’s takeaway from 1989 → as minor Fujian party chief then, he now drives anti‑corruption purges to ensure PLA remains a tightly controlled party army.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Leaked trial humanizes an abstract event, showing concrete resistance inside the PLA, not just among students.  
- Impact: Undermines monolithic narratives of CCP control and may inspire present-day insiders to document or resist unlawful orders.  
- Watch next: Monitor Chinese censorship response, archival purges, and whether similar materials on other 1989 dissenters surface abroad.
