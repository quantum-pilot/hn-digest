# Have I been Flocked? – Check if your license plate is being watched

### TL;DR
Since the site is rate-limited, comments describe a US-focused tool letting drivers check if their license plate appears in known Flock Safety police searches, built from public-record audit logs. The dataset is incomplete because it only covers agencies whose search logs are available. Commenters worry about pervasive vehicle tracking, urge resistance via law and policy, and compare US attitudes to ALPRs with other countries’ longer-standing ANPR systems. Being listed signals past police interest in a plate, raising concerns about misuse, chilling effects, and surveillance normalization.

### Comment pulse
- ALPR search logs enable retroactive tracking → many see a creeping surveillance state, argue for legal pushback now — counterpoint: few states already curb ALPRs.  
- Dataset shows plates queried by police in Flock tools, not all scanned plates → incomplete due to FOIA delays, redactions, and states blocking ALPR disclosures.  
- Non-US readers compare ALPRs to long-standing ANPR abroad, question why Americans accept private Ring-style surveillance yet panic over government plate tracking.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning opaque search logs into a simple “have I been tracked?” check is powerful for public awareness and organizing.  
- Impact: If normalized, such tools pressure municipalities on retention limits, warrant requirements, and ALPR deployment density.  
- Watch next: Track new state-level ALPR bills, Flock contract renewals, and technical audits showing misuse or breaches of ALPR systems.
