# Perl's decline was cultural

## TL;DR
The author argues Perl’s decline was driven less by technical limits and more by its culture: a gatekeeping, sysadmin-derived “wizard priesthood” that prized difficulty, cleverness, and backward compatibility. This yielded TIMTOWTDI, a stable but ossified core, and an overreliance on CPAN, culminating in the long, divisive Perl 6 schism. At the same time, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Python offered friendlier onboarding, batteries-included ecosystems, and clearer norms. Perl survives as a successful, influential legacy tool rather than a default choice.

## Comment pulse
- Culture turned newcomers off → wizard/monk aesthetics, opaque one-liners, and “written by wizards, for wizards” syntax; Python felt sane and welcoming instead.  
- Language design mattered too → scalar/array context, references, bolted-on OO, and magic defaults made Perl error-prone versus more uniform Ruby/Python—counterpoint: many critiques were vibes, not specifics.  
- Flexibility didn’t scale → TIMTOWTDI plus uneven CPAN quality and slow startup hurt team projects; once others had package indexes, CPAN ceased to be a killer advantage.

## LLM perspective
- View: Culture and design reinforced each other: a cleverness-first community favored a cleverness-maximizing language, which then selected for that culture.  
- Impact: Teams now care more about readability, onboarding, and ecosystem governance; Perl’s trajectory is a cautionary tale for today’s “power-user” languages.  
- Watch next: How Rust, TypeScript, and Go manage growth pressures, gatekeeping tendencies, and competing package ecosystems over the next decade.
