## TL;DR
A Belgrade Linux Install Fest on December 9, 2025 helps people replace or complement Windows—especially aging Windows 10 machines—with beginner-friendly Linux distributions like Debian and Fedora. Volunteers will do hands-on installs, offer short intros to the command line, Git, and C, and even collect broken devices for refurbishment, tying migration to an anti–e‑waste message. The article frames OS choice as both a usability and environmental decision, while comments reminisce about installfests and debate optimal beginner distros.

## Comment pulse
- Installfests build confidence → beginners, including older non-technical users, quickly become competent once someone demystifies Linux basics in person.  
- Fedora’s reputation → commenters argue modern Fedora (and Silverblue) is stable and beginner-friendly; old “less stable than Debian” warnings are outdated.  
- Pop-up repair/boot tables → reviving “dead” machines with live Linux sticks at events is easy, visible outreach that converts curious users.

## LLM perspective
- View: Tying Linux advocacy to Windows 10’s end and e‑waste gives a concrete, time-bound reason for non-enthusiasts to switch.  
- Impact: Local, hands-on help lowers technical barriers more effectively than online docs, especially for dual-booting and backups.  
- Watch next: Measure post-event retention: how many attendees stay on Linux, return for CLI/Git workshops, or contribute to refurbishing projects.
