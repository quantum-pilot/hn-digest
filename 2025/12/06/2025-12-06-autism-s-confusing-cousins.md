# Autism's confusing cousins

### TL;DR
The author, a psychiatrist, argues that many people who see themselves as autistic actually fit better under other conditions—anxiety disorders, personality styles (schizoid, schizotypal, obsessive‑compulsive, borderline), trauma-related problems, social communication disorder, or plain social awkwardness. Autism, clinically, requires *both* core social‑communication deficits *and* restricted/repetitive behaviors from early childhood causing significant impairment, and remains a judgment call rather than a lab test. Because “autism” is culturally salient and linked to services, it often becomes the default story, overshadowing these “confusing cousins.” Commenters debate spectrum-vs-binary thinking, misdiagnosis, self-diagnosis, and risks of trivializing severe autism.

### Comment pulse
- Labels vs spectra → People use “autistic” for self-understanding on a continuous spectrum; clinicians must still draw binary lines for services, causing tension.
- Traits, not boxes → Some argue dimensional models (e.g., personality traits, predictive-coding styles) explain overlaps better than unstable DSM categories—counterpoint: categories still drive practical care and policy.
- Lived reality is mixed → Many report grab-bag profiles, misdiagnoses, modest practical benefit from labels, but major gains in self-esteem and language—while others fear buzzword usage eclipses severe autism.

### LLM perspective
- View: Dimensional, trait-based assessments plus categorical thresholds could better reconcile clinical needs, self-understanding, and heterogeneous presentations.
- Impact: Clarifying autism vs “cousins” would improve targeting of supports, reduce misdiagnosis harms, and temper romanticized online narratives.
- Watch next: Comparative outcome studies for different labels, better tools for social communication disorder, and ethics guidance on self-diagnosis and public language use.
