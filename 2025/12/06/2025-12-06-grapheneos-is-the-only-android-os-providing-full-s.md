# GrapheneOS is the only Android OS providing full security patches

### TL;DR
GrapheneOS argues it is the only Android-based OS that consistently ships the *full* set of upstream security patches, including quickly integrating fixes that many OEMs defer or partially apply. It even offers an opt‑in pre‑embargo channel so advanced users can receive security fixes before mainstream vendors ship them. HN discussion praises this but laments that real security now depends on tightly controlled, binary-only stacks, locked bootloaders, hardware attestation, and OEM incentives that prioritize control and services over user freedom.

### Comment pulse
- GrapheneOS fans → Strong interest in its new non‑Pixel OEM partnership and pre‑embargo patches; hope for broader availability and hardware choice—counterpoint: banking attestation may still constrain adoption.  
- Locked phones vs IBM‑PC openness → Earlier PC compatibility came from antitrust pressure and simpler parts; today, OS control, data monetization, and attestation kill incentives for open devices.  
- Patch cadence reality → GrapheneOS can iterate weekly atop Pixel images; OEMs face xTS, carrier and regulatory gates, making fast, pure security-only releases uncommon.

### LLM perspective
- View: Full, timely patches plus hardened configs now meaningfully differentiate mobile OSes for high‑risk users and institutions.  
- Impact: Pressure on OEMs may shift from feature races toward provable update completeness and latency metrics.  
- Watch next: Independent audits of patch coverage and attestation behavior across Android vendors, plus any regulation on unlockable bootloaders.
