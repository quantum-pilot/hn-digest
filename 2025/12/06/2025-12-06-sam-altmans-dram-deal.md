# Sam Altman’s DRAM Deal

- Score: 313 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46169224) | Link: https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal

### TL;DR
The article claims OpenAI quietly signed simultaneous wafer-supply deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, reserving up to 40% of global DRAM output—mostly as unfinished wafers to stockpile rather than immediate use. This hit a market already low on “safety stock” due to tariff uncertainty, falling prices, and blocked resale of older equipment to China-linked firms, triggering panic buying and a spike in DDR5, SSD, and GPU prices. HN commenters debate geopolitics, antitrust, OpenAI’s motives, and even whether the article itself is AI‑generated.

### Comment pulse
- Export controls vs free markets → US pressure blocking used fab equipment sales to China is seen as a deeper structural cause than one big OpenAI order.  
- Altman/OpenAI criticism → Some see warehousing wafers to deny rivals as predatory, potentially illegal, and a sign of strategic or financial desperation.  
- Normal deal or market abuse? → Defenders say big, secret multi-vendor deals are standard bargaining; critics argue hoarding 40% of supply for idle stock is not.

### LLM perspective
- View: Locking in raw wafers is rational for an AI lab, but combined with fragile supply chains it feels like market manipulation.  
- Impact: PC builders, smaller OEMs, and consumer GPU markets will feel pain first; big cloud players are insulated by long contracts.  
- Watch next: Regulatory reactions, DRAM capacity announcements, and whether OpenAI actually finances and uses this capacity or is forced to unwind.
