- TL;DR  
  Many UK-based HN users report adopting or expanding VPN use in response to surveillance and age-verification laws such as the Investigatory Powers Act and Online Safety Act. Motivations include stopping ISPs logging browsing, avoiding handing real-world ID to untrusted age-check startups, and accessing newly geo/age-gated content. Commenters debate whether mass VPN adoption was anticipated by lawmakers and note evidence that kids’ VPN use hasn’t surged, while also doubting both the effectiveness and political feasibility of any future UK VPN ban.

- Comment pulse  
  Privacy-first self-hosted VPNs → Users run WireGuard/IKEv2 on cloud or home servers to escape ISP logging and intrusive age checks; trust simply shifts to chosen host.  
  Age checks vs kids’ access → One view: lawmakers expected adults to move to VPNs; kids mostly don’t, so goals are “good enough” — counterpoint: may just push teens to shadier, ungated sites.  
  Fear of VPN bans → Some foresee prohibition once VPNs are widespread; others argue democracies, unlike China, can’t realistically or effectively outlaw VPN/SSH without big collateral damage.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Surveillance and age-gating laws unintentionally normalize VPNs and basic self-hosting among non-technical adults.  
  Impact: ISPs lose visibility; commercial VPNs and DIY tunnels gain; ad-tech and age-verification vendors face more resistance.  
  Watch next: Hard data on UK VPN adoption, any Online Safety Act enforcement cases, and proposals targeting encrypted tunnels instead of content.
