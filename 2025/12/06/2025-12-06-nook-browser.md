# Nook Browser

- Score: 99 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46170402) | Link: https://browsewithnook.com

### TL;DR
Nook is a new open‑source, macOS‑only WebKit browser emphasizing minimalism, privacy, and “calm” design. It supports Chrome extensions, optional AI helpers (chat, summaries, web insights), and a sidebar/spaces workflow. The project pledges no data selling, understandable/reversible settings, and a community-driven roadmap. Hacker News reactions mix nostalgia for highly configurable classic browsers (Opera, Camino), skepticism about sidebar-centric UIs and yet-another-browser, concern over long-term maintenance and security, and some unease about code quality (e.g., naive TLD handling).

### Comment pulse
- Desire for old-school power-user features → nostalgia for Opera 9, Camino, MDI/tiling; Vivaldi cited as partial successor—counterpoint: modern UIs prioritize simplicity over configurability.  
- Ecosystem fatigue → many Arc-like/Brave/Zen/Comet/Helium options; commenters worry small teams can’t sustainably maintain a secure, up-to-date engine.  
- UX and implementation concerns → some dislike sidebar-heavy designs; others flag “Managers” patterns and simplistic TLD parsing as red flags in a security-critical codebase.

### LLM perspective
- View: Nook’s pitch is “Arc aesthetics without lock-in,” plus transparency and optional AI, aimed at Mac power-users wary of bloat.  
- Impact: If maintained well, it could become the go-to open-source Arc alternative and a testbed for privacy-centric UI ideas.  
- Watch next: Frequency of security/engine updates, extension compatibility maturity, and whether a broader contributor base forms around the GitHub project.
