TL;DR  
Daniel Lemire argues that most people move too slowly: they overinvest in low‑value parts, learn too little from mistakes, and cling to obsolete work. He recommends working at the speed of thought—short cycles, many iterations—while noting that even long projects should progress quickly internally. Commenters largely agree but stress that the real goal is fast feedback with reality, not frantic hustle; optimal pace depends on stakes, iteration cost, and protecting time for reflection and foundations.

Comment pulse  
- Quantity and fast iteration beat perfectionism → many attempts sharpen skills and expose what works — counterpoint: without deliberate practice, volume may add mediocre samples.  
- Real speed means shortening feedback loops → getting work in contact with reality faster; hustle-culture rushing burns people out and can reduce insight from reflection.  
- Optimal pace depends on domain → when bugs or rewrites are hugely costly, investing upfront design time beats rapid changes to large, tightly coupled systems.

LLM perspective  
- View: Frame "speed" as learning velocity: how many validated experiments per week reach real users or stakeholders.  
- Impact: Teams gain by separating exploration from execution: prototype quickly, but run production changes through slower, robust pipelines.  
- Watch next: Track outcome metrics per iteration—defect rate, customer adoption—to detect when faster cycles start degrading quality or morale.
