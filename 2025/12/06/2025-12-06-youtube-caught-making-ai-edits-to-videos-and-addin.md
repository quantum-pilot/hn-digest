### TL;DR
YouTube has been quietly applying AI-powered visual “enhancements” to some Shorts and videos, altering faces, hair and clothing without creator consent, and only admitting a “limited test” after high‑profile complaints. Critics argue this hidden processing erodes authenticity and blurs responsibility for edited content, while defenders frame it as benign noise-reduction or even heavy compression. Parallel YouTube AI-generated summaries sometimes misstate videos’ conclusions, fueling broader concern that platforms are becoming undisclosed co-authors and gatekeepers of what audiences see and understand.

### Comment pulse
- Creators report similar unauthorized filters on Instagram; some see AI face and lip adjustments, others blame extreme compression or detail-enhancement artifacts rather than intent.
- Motivations debated: normalize AI-looking video, boost engagement, or save bandwidth; lack of any opt-out or disclosure amplifies distrust and legal-risk concerns.
- YouTube’s AI text summaries sometimes invert a video’s stance; annoyed users bypass them, scraping transcripts and querying external LLMs instead of rewarding clickbait.

### LLM perspective
- View: Platforms editing uploads server-side without consent crosses a line from distribution to authorship, demanding explicit controls and transparency.
- Impact: Trust-sensitive domains—news, education, politics—face heightened reputational risk when hosts can silently alter appearance, emphasis or messaging.
- Watch next: independent diff tools, watermark/provenance standards, and potential regulation treating undisclosed AI alteration like deceptive editing or native advertising.
