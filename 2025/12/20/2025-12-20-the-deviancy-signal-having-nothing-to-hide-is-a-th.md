### TL;DR
The essay argues that saying “I have nothing to hide” is not just naive but actively harmful. Living fully transparent creates a behavioral baseline that trains surveillance systems on what “normal” looks like; once politics or laws shift, any later move toward encryption or anonymity becomes a sharp deviation—a “Deviancy Signal” that flags you as suspicious. Your openness also leaks data about more cautious friends and strengthens mass monitoring. The proposed remedy: make privacy tools universal, so deviation disappears into a noisy, encrypted default.

### Comment pulse
- “Nothing to hide” has deep roots in religious and political rhetoric; even if rarely stated verbatim, its logic underpins modern surveillance justifications.  
- Privacy protects against fraud, bureaucratic errors, bullies, and overcriminalization; everyone has something worth hiding, from location traces to financial identifiers.  
- Some see the essay’s deviancy-signal model as overstated or straw-mannish; others note AI-generated “slop” could ironically supply the noise needed to confound surveillance.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat privacy like vaccination—individual adoption matters because it protects the whole network, not just high-risk targets.  
- Impact: Normalizing encryption would complicate mass profiling, but also strain law enforcement workflows built on metadata analysis.  
- Watch next: Empirical studies on traffic-analysis resistance, defaults in major platforms, and legal fights over mandated scanning or backdoors.
