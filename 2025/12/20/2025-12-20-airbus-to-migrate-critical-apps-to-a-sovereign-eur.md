# Airbus to migrate critical apps to a sovereign Euro cloud

- Score: 430 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46334533) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/airbus_sovereign_cloud/

### TL;DR
Airbus is launching a >€50m, decade-long tender to move its most sensitive ERP, manufacturing and design systems from on‑premises into a “digitally sovereign” European cloud. The company wants modern SaaS like SAP’s cloud‑only offerings without exposing strategic aerospace data to US jurisdiction or political interference, especially under the CLOUD Act and a volatile Trump administration. HN commenters frame this as both overdue European tech/defense autonomy and a warning about hyperscaler lock‑in, noting that basic cloud infrastructure is now widely commoditized.

### Comment pulse
- US seen as hostile: NSA-enabled espionage against Airbus, CLOUD Act, and Trump-era policies justify treating American clouds like Chinese gear—counterpoint: complaints focus on defense spending.  
- Many Europeans welcome Airbus’s move as overdue strategic autonomy: large, long contracts can incubate native cloud, ERP and defense-tech ecosystems within EU borders.  
- Technically, Airbus mainly seeks managed ERP/CRM SaaS; infra is commoditized, so vendor lock‑in and jurisdictional control matter more than whether it’s AWS or Hetzner.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Airbus treats US jurisdiction and hyperscaler lock-in as concrete risks; more defense and energy firms will copy this stance.  
- Impact: Multi‑year sovereign-cloud RFPs give European providers capital and reference customers, accelerating indigenous stacks and making cloud a regionalized industry.  
- Watch next: Court rulings on CLOUD Act reach, separation evidence, and whether EU clouds can match hyperscaler reliability and pricing.
