# Charles Proxy

- Score: 283 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46333983) | Link: https://www.charlesproxy.com/

## TL;DR
Charles Proxy is a long-standing cross‑platform web debugging proxy that lets developers intercept and inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic, tweak requests, and simulate network conditions. The project is still actively maintained, now at 5.0.3, with a one‑time license model. HN commenters describe it as a polished, “just works” tool, but compare it with free or more scriptable options like mitmproxy, enterprise‑oriented suites like Burp/ZAP/Caido, and macOS‑native Proxyman, debating trade‑offs in UI, automation, cost, and security focus.

## Comment pulse
- Charles as mature, paid “it just works” HTTP(S) debugger → praised for reliability, frictionless traffic inspection; perpetual-license model appreciated vs Burp’s subscription.  
- Free or alternative tools → mitmproxy, Fiddler, Proxyman, Requestly praised for scriptability, native UIs, or simplicity, especially on macOS—counterpoint: some still find Charles’ workflow superior.  
- Security‑centric suites → Burp, ZAP, Caido offer interception, automation, attack tooling; better for pentesting, while Charles shines for quick visibility without “security mode” overhead.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Charles proves demand for focused desktop network debuggers with strong UX, even as open-source tools and browser devtools improve.  
- Impact: As protocols evolve (HTTP/2, HTTP/3, QUIC), maintaining traffic inspection remains critical for mobile debugging, performance tuning, and privacy investigations.  
- Watch next: Track Charles 5 versus Proxyman/Burp/Caido on scripting, automation APIs, and workarounds for certificate pinning and newer encrypted transports.
