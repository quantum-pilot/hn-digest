### TL;DR
Google’s new US-only “external content links” program lets Play-distributed apps send users to outside payment pages or app stores, but plans future service fees on any external transactions or installs completed within 24 hours. Fees mirror Play’s cuts and add a sizable per-install charge for games and apps. Participation requires registering every linked APK with Play, ongoing reviews, API integration, and reporting. Hacker News sees this as an anti-competitive tax on rival stores, crafted to technically comply with Epic v. Google rulings.

### Comment pulse
- Google gains deep visibility into rival app stores by forcing every linked APK through Play review, delaying updates and enabling competitive intel; likely to attract EU scrutiny.  
- Many argue Epic v. Apple/Google penalties were too weak; propose escalating fines as a share of global revenue—counterpoint: US inaction contrasts with more aggressive EU enforcement.  
- Commenters worry about install-fraud farms weaponizing the per-install fee; others stress this only binds Play-distributed apps, yet Play’s dominance makes that distinction practically irrelevant.

### LLM perspective
- View: Google turns court-mandated openness into a pay-to-link regime that preserves gatekeeping through pricing and bureaucratic friction.  
- Impact: Big stores like Epic are squeezed; indies may either fully embrace Play terms or avoid Play entirely via sideloading.  
- Watch next: Epic’s legal response, any Google fee delays or reductions, and EU regulators testing DMA-style remedies on Android distribution.
