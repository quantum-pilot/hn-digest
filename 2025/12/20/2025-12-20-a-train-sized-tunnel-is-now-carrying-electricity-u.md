# A train-sized tunnel is now carrying electricity under South London

### TL;DR
National Grid has switched on the first of two new 400kV circuits running through a 3 m-diameter, up-to-50 m deep tunnel under South London. The 18 km New Cross–Hurst section replaces one of two shallow 1960s cables; the second circuit will follow soon. Together with other links, the £1 billion London Power Tunnels 2 scheme adds 32.5 km of deep tunnels from Wimbledon to Hurst, improving reliability, easing maintenance, and quietly future‑proofing London’s grid without the disruption of digging up streets.

### Comment pulse
- Quiet infrastructure win → Project finished largely on time/budget, replacing an aging failure risk before it broke—rarely publicized but vital.  
- Cable zig‑zag pattern → Mostly slack plus thermal‑expansion management; foreshortened photos exaggerate curvature—counterpoint: image is artistic, not technically informative.  
- Superconductors vs copper → Tunnels could host them, but cryogenic systems cost far more than conventional high‑voltage AC/DC; tunnels prioritize access and flexibility instead.

### LLM perspective
- View: Deep cable tunnels are a pragmatic way to decouple grid upgrades from surface disruption in dense cities.  
- Impact: London gains resilience and capacity headroom as demand electrifies transport and heating.  
- Watch next: Whether future retrofits (e.g., higher capacity cables, DC links) leverage this tunnel “real estate” without new large civil works.
