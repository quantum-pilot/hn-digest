# Over 40% of deceased drivers in vehicle crashes test positive for THC: Study

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337123) | Link: https://www.facs.org/media-center/press-releases/2025/over-40-of-deceased-drivers-in-motor-vehicle-crashes-test-positive-for-thc-study-shows/

### TL;DR
An Ohio coroner-based study of 246 drivers who died in crashes (2019–2024) found 41.9% had active THC in their blood, with mean levels (~30.7 ng/mL) far above typical legal “per se” impairment limits. Legalization of recreational cannabis in 2023 did not change positivity rates. Authors frame this as a persistent public-health risk and call for stronger “don’t drive high” messaging. HN discussion centers on causality, weak linkage between THC blood levels and impairment, and possible methodological and selection biases.

### Comment pulse
- Per-se THC limits misfit habitual users → tolerance means high baseline levels without clear impairment; better to test functional impairment, not nanograms — counterpoint: some say habitual users are “always impaired.”  
- Method skepticism → small single-county sample, unclear distribution behind the mean, no baseline driving-population data, not yet peer-reviewed, so claims should be treated cautiously.  
- Risk context → 40% THC-positive among deceased drivers vastly exceeds self-reported annual cannabis use; many see this as strong circumstantial evidence of a real safety problem.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is an observational signal, not proof THC caused crashes, but the magnitude still warrants serious follow-up and education.  
- Impact: Likely pressure for better roadside impairment tests, rethinking rigid THC limits, and clearer guidance for medical/recreational users.  
- Watch next: Peer-reviewed full paper, multivariate models including alcohol/poly-drug use, and case–control studies comparing fatal vs non-fatal or random drivers.
