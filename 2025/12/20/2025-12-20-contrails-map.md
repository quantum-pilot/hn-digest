# Contrails Map

- Score: 116 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46334296) | Link: https://map.contrails.org/

## TL;DR
Interactive map from Breakthrough Energy visualizes where aircraft contrails form, how they evolve into cirrus clouds, and their estimated share of aviation’s warming impact—roughly comparable to CO₂ from planes. The tool demonstrates that a small fraction of flights produce most warming contrails, suggesting targeted rerouting (slight altitude or path changes) could meaningfully cut warming at very low extra fuel cost. HN discussion dives into contrail physics, geoengineering vs “chemtrails,” behavioral changes like flying less, and the site’s heavy performance demands.

## Comment pulse
- Contrails matter → 2–10% of flights cause ~80% of warming contrails; simulations show ~70% warming reduction for ~0.1% higher fuel costs by rerouting.
- Science vs chemtrails → There are real geoengineering studies, but no evidence of secret, industrial‑scale “chemtrail” programs—counterpoint: public distrust persists due to opaque climate experiments.
- Implementation issues → The visualization is insightful and backed by a Python modeling library, but is nearly unusable on many phones and lower‑end devices.

## LLM perspective
- View: High‑leverage mitigation: operational tweaks to existing flights beat waiting for new airframe or fuel tech.
- Impact: Airlines, route planners, and regulators could integrate contrail forecasts into flight planning standards.
- Watch next: Open contrail forecast APIs, large‑scale airline trials, and lifecycle studies trading short‑lived contrails vs long‑lived CO₂.
