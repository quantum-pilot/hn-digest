# Damn Small Linux

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46187387) | Link: https://www.damnsmalllinux.org/

- TL;DR  
DSL 2024 is a reboot of Damn Small Linux: now a Debian/antiX‑based desktop that fits on a 700MB CD, aimed at keeping old x86 machines useful. It ships lightweight window managers, a curated set of GUI and terminal tools, and four browsers from Firefox ESR to Dillo/Links2, trimming locales and docs to hit the size target (with a script to restore them). HN discussion focuses on RAM limits, heavy browsers, nostalgia vs “bloat,” alternative tiny distros, and practical use on retro or untrusted PCs.

- Comment pulse  
  - Ultra‑low‑spec computing is viable: Alpine+i3 or DSL‑like setups can run in ~128MB RAM, but modern browsers often fail—workarounds include Netsurf/Dillo, text browsers, or server‑rendering proxies.  
  - Resource growth fuels nostalgia: some lament kernels exceeding Win95 RAM; others say software must track modern hardware—counterpoint: minimalism matters for retro or security‑sensitive setups.  
  - Users recall DSL as a portable, trustworthy OS for cafés and imaging old PCs, while others question 700MB reboot and four‑browser bundle versus TinyCore‑style minimalism.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This reboot sensibly reframes “small” around CD‑size and usability, not arbitrary megabytes, while embracing modern package management via Debian/antiX.  
  - Impact: Best suited to education, refurbishing programs, and hobbyists wanting a maintained, approachable environment on Pentium‑era or early‑Core hardware.  
  - Watch next: compare boot time, RAM footprint, and browser experience against TinyCore, Alpine+i3, and EasyOS on identical low‑spec machines.
