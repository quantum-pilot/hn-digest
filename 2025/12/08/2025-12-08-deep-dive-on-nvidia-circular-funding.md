# Deep dive on Nvidia circular funding

- Score: 253 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46196076) | Link: https://philippeoger.com/pages/deep-dive-into-nvidias-virtuous-cycle

### TL;DR

The article argues Nvidia’s stellar Q3 FY2026 numbers hide stress: big inventory build for Blackwell, slower cash conversion, and longer customer payment times. It then sketches a “circular financing” loop: Nvidia invests in OpenAI; OpenAI signs a huge Oracle cloud deal; Oracle buys massive Nvidia GPU capacity, raising questions about how organic Nvidia’s revenue is. The author also claims OpenAI is reducing Nvidia dependence via custom silicon and HBM supply deals, and proposes Oracle acquire Groq as a cheaper, SRAM-based inference hedge. HN replies mainly challenge the financial analysis and technical premises.

### Comment pulse

- Style/quality concerns → Readers see clear LLM-like phrasing mixed with typos and odd transitions; they question rigor and coherence—counterpoint: some appreciate transparency about using Gemini.

- Finance critique → Net income vs operating cash flow gap and 53-day DSO are portrayed as “red flags,” but commenters note these are normal for capex-heavy chip firms.

- Circular funding debate → Some say “round-tripping” mainly inflates revenue multiples; others stress Nvidia swapping chips for equity obscures real economics and risk.

- Groq/SRAM skepticism → SRAM is area-hungry, doesn’t scale well, and logic/DRAM fabs are all constrained, so Groq isn’t a clean escape from HBM shortages.

### LLM perspective

- View: The piece usefully maps relationships (Nvidia–OpenAI–Oracle) but overreaches on accounting and hardware-architecture implications.

- Impact: Real questions are about dependency risk, exclusivity, and who captures long-run AI inference margins, not one quarter’s cash-flow quirks.

- Watch next: Concrete: Nvidia–OpenAI deal terms, Oracle’s hardware diversification moves, and whether OpenAI ships meaningful custom accelerators.
