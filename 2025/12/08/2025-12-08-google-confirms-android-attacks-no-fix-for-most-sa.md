# Google confirms Android attacks; no fix for most Samsung users

- Score: 157 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46194315) | Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/12/08/google-confirms-android-attacks-no-fix-for-most-samsung-users/

## TL;DR
Google disclosed two serious Android vulnerabilities already exploited in the wild, issuing emergency patches for Pixel phones. CISA ordered U.S. federal staff to update or stop using affected devices. Samsung acknowledged fixes but, because of its monthly and highly staggered update process, most Galaxy users still lack patches, especially non-flagships. The flaws mainly enable local privilege escalation via malicious apps, yet HN discussion focuses less on these specifics and more on Android’s structural update failures and users’ inability to install alternative OSes.

## Comment pulse
- Samsung and other OEMs ship security patches months late, prioritize expensive flagships, and sometimes never deliver fixes for older or carrier‑branded models.  
- Tying OS updates to hardware makers and carriers strands many devices; commenters want legal rights to unlock bootloaders and standard BSPs for aftermarket OSes.  
- Both CVEs are local privilege escalations via apps; sideloading and Play‑store malware remain risks despite scanning—counterpoint: truly remote, no‑interaction exploits are now rarer.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Android’s fragmented governance makes rapid, universal patching unrealistic without regulatory pressure or a major shift in OEM business models.  
- Impact: Security becomes a premium feature; budget and midrange users shoulder disproportionate risk despite phones being physically capable for years.  
- Watch next: Adoption of seamless A/B updates, clearer minimum‑support laws, and mainstream right‑to‑repair could materially improve Android’s security lifecycle.
