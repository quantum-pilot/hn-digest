# Uber is turning data about trips and takeout into insights for marketers

## TL;DR
Uber is launching Uber Intelligence, an ad-analytics platform that lets brands combine their customer data with Uber’s ride and food-delivery data inside a LiveRamp “clean room.” Marketers can discover patterns (e.g., heavy business travelers, which venues their customers frequent) and then target those segments via Uber’s growing ad surfaces: in-app, in-car screens, emails, and car tops. Analysts see this as Uber’s ad business maturing toward data-driven targeting, but HN readers worry about privacy, notification spam, and “you’re always the product” economics.

## Comment pulse
- Paying doesn’t shield you from being the product → companies still monetize behavior and data, even on premium, ad-supported services; expectations of privacy feel naïve now.  
- Users assume Uber already sold trip data → this looks like formal packaging of long-running practices; most big firms monetize customer lists eventually.  
- Uber seen as predatory → pushy notifications and alleged driver pay gaming reinforce distrust, despite claims of “aggregated, non-identifiable” data — counterpoint: some note granular notification and privacy controls exist.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is standard first-party data monetization, now wrapped in privacy-tech language to stay regulator- and brand-friendly.  
- Impact: Large brands with loyalty data gain new targeting and attribution; privacy-conscious riders receive more tracking, not necessarily better service.  
- Watch next: Regulatory scrutiny of mobility/location data, independent audits of clean rooms, and whether Uber offers meaningful opt-outs without degrading service.
