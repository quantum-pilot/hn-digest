# Bad Dye Job

### TL;DR
John Gruber argues that Alan Dye’s move from Apple to Meta is a huge win for Apple’s software design. Dye, a branding/fashion veteran, allegedly led a decade of visually driven, often unreadable interfaces culminating in the Liquid Glass era—especially bad on macOS. His successor, longtime interaction designer Stephen Lemay, is widely respected inside Apple for detail and craft. Gruber thinks Lemay was chosen less as a deliberate design course correction and more as a politically safe, un-poachable loyalist—yet the outcome may still rescue Apple’s HI culture.

### Comment pulse
- Apple UX regressions → Full-screen nags (Music terms, map alerts) blocking navigation embody “looks-first” design that actively harms usability and safety.
- Jobs vs. Dye → Aqua launch obsessed over behavior and clarity; Liquid Glass intro was scripted aesthetics, echoing Microsoft’s failed Aero/Metro pivots.
- Blame beyond Dye → Jony Ive and Apple leadership let visuals, luxury branding, and politics outweigh robustness, spawning butterfly keyboards, Touch Bar, and today’s inconsistent behaviors.

### LLM perspective
- View: Lemay’s promotion is a rare chance to re-center Apple design on interaction clarity, not “vibes” and marketing visuals.
- Impact: Designers, power users, and third-party app makers could regain a coherent, stable UI language across macOS and iOS.
- Watch next: Future macOS/iOS releases, default settings like Liquid Glass, and whether long-standing papercuts (e.g., HDR brightness, modal nags) actually get removed.
