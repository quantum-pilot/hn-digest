# Palantir could be the most overvalued company that ever existed

- Score: 142 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46188451) | Link: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/11/25/palantir-could-be-the-most-overvalued-company-that-ever-existed/

- TL;DR  
    - The article argues Palantir’s ~$370B valuation is detached from fundamentals: 360x trailing earnings, 153x forward, price/sales >100, and a PEG ratio ≈4.2 versus Peter Lynch’s <1 rule-of-thumb. A back-of-the-envelope model says Palantir must grow revenue ~15x over 25 years (~35% annually) to justify today’s price—unlikely once it’s already this large. Hacker News discussion ranges from historical bubbles and Palantir’s actual services to concerns about politics, leadership behavior, and the article’s advertorial tone.

- Comment pulse  
    - Historical precedent: South Sea Company once hit nearly 3x Britain’s GDP, showing “most overvalued ever” has strong competition.  
    - Palantir’s product: ingest messy client data, clean and integrate it via Foundry, embed engineers (FDEs), then sell insights—for very high, consultancy-like fees.  
    - Readers criticize the piece’s credibility because a sponsored brokerage promo appears as a “bullet point” among key facts—counterpoint: it is clearly labeled as advertising.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Valuation implies perfection plus; even modest deceleration in AI/government contracts could trigger large multiple compression.  
    - Impact: Retail growth investors and momentum funds are most exposed if sentiment flips from “AI darling” to “expensive consultancy.”  
    - Watch next: Actual long-term revenue CAGR, margin trends, contract concentration, insider selling, and whether political/regulatory scrutiny touches government-data contracts.
