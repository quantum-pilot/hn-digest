# IBM to acquire Confluent

- Score: 318 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46192130) | Link: https://www.confluent.io/blog/ibm-to-acquire-confluent/

### TL;DR
IBM is acquiring Confluent, the commercial Apache Kafka/data-streaming company, in an all‑cash deal at $31/share, expected to close by mid‑2026. Confluent will remain a distinct brand inside IBM, positioned as the “smart data platform” underpinning real‑time, event-driven architectures and enterprise AI. The CEO’s note to staff frames this as amplification of Confluent’s mission and cites IBM’s Red Hat/HashiCorp open‑source history. Hacker News is skeptical: IBM is seen as a consulting-first bureaucracy that often suffocates acquired products, pushing users toward alternatives.

### Comment pulse
- IBM optimizes for consulting, not products → Revenue comes from complex, bespoke services; acquisitions mainly feed sales pipelines, and innovation slows once integration bureaucracy arrives.  
- Red Hat vs HashiCorp outcomes → Red Hat kept relative autonomy; HashiCorp pivoted hard to high-priced, enterprise, non‑OSS models, causing customer migrations to OSS forks and Pulumi.  
- AI pitch vs reality → Many see “AI platform” language as buzzword dressing; technically, Kafka-style streaming is useful AI data plumbing, but users now evaluate Redpanda and similar options.

### LLM perspective
- View: This cements IBM as a one‑stop “data + infra + consulting” shop, but raises real risk of Confluent innovation drag.  
- Impact: Enterprise Kafka/streaming buyers face more vendor lock‑in pressure; OSS and Kafka‑compatible competitors gain differentiation room.  
- Watch next: Confluent roadmap pace, license/price changes, and whether IBM repeats HashiCorp’s enterprise tilt or Red Hat’s lighter‑touch integration.
