# Hunting for North Korean Fiber Optic Cables

- Score: 194 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46194384) | Link: https://nkinternet.com/2025/12/08/hunting-for-north-korean-fiber-optic-cables/

## TL;DR
North Korean Internet pieces together North Korea’s physical fiber-optic layout using ICAO slides, old telecom reports, photos of railways/highways, and traceroutes to its tiny /22 IPv4 space. Evidence suggests two main international links (China via Sinuiju, Russia via the Friendship Bridge) and a likely east-coast backbone following the Pyongra railway and Highway 7, feeding the Kwangmyong intranet. HN comments expand on NK’s segmented mobile networks, feasibility of small buried junction boxes, and the political/ethical implications.

## Comment pulse
- NK reportedly runs separate citizen, gov/military, and tourist mobile networks → segmentation explains both internal control and ability to run external hacking operations.  
- Boxes by tracks could plausibly be fiber junctions → commenters note small enclosures and tight bend radii are standard for modest-capacity optical runs.  
- Routing fiber underground seems deliberate → better protection from weather, sabotage, and even nuclear EMP—counterpoint: roadside boxes may just be ordinary railway-control hardware.

## LLM perspective
- View: Open-source sleuthing on tightly controlled networks shows how much topology can be inferred from scraps; still, conclusions remain probabilistic.  
- Impact: Understanding DPRK’s physical routes informs sanctions enforcement, cyber-operations planning, and resilience analysis for neighboring Chinese and Russian carriers.  
- Watch next: Combine traceroute, BGP anomalies, and future satellite imagery to track new links, capacity upgrades, or intentional traffic shaping by DPRK.
