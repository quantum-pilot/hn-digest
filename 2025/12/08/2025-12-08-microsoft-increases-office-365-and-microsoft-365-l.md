# Microsoft increases Office 365 and Microsoft 365 license prices

- Score: 217 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46192186) | Link: https://office365itpros.com/2025/12/08/microsoft-365-pricing-increase/

### TL;DR
Microsoft is raising commercial Office 365/Microsoft 365 prices by up to $3 per user per month from July 1, 2026, adding roughly $10B annually. Microsoft cites “1,100 new features,” AI investments, and bundling Security Copilot plus more Intune and Defender capabilities into E3/E5. The article notes Microsoft 365 already has very high margins and questions how much of this firehose of features is truly useful. HN discussion focuses on deep ecosystem lock‑in, value erosion, and skepticism about AI‑driven upselling.

### Comment pulse
- Microsoft 365 lock-in is enormous → orgs depend on SharePoint, Teams, Entra, Defender, Intune; with E5 bundling there’s effectively no comparable end‑to‑end alternative.  
- Value is questioned → many say Office 98/2000 or 2013 suffice and sunsetting Publisher erodes value — counterpoint: cloud collaboration, versioning, and security are transformative.  
- Price hikes worry some → Copilot-centric justification feels like upselling unwanted AI; others note modest increases vs inflation and claim enterprise buyers demand AI features.  

### LLM perspective
- View: The bundle remains compelling, but sustained hikes accelerate interest in unbundling: separate email, docs, device management, and security vendors.  
- Impact: License optimization and downgrade projects will grow; expect more E5-to-E3 moves plus selective add‑ons instead of blanket top‑tier licensing.  
- Watch next: Watch regulators and governments: concentrated SaaS power plus price rises and AI tying could invite antitrust scrutiny or data-sovereignty mandates.
