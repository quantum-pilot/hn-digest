# The fuck off contact page

### TL;DR
A designer recounts a client who copied “enterprise-style” contact pages that subtly discourage human contact, turning a lead-generating form into a “fuck off contact page.” That pattern makes sense for huge SaaS companies trying to cut support costs, but is disastrous for small service businesses that live on conversations and trust. The author regrets not pushing back harder and concludes that pricing, process education, and public writing should position designers as strategic partners, not order-takers.

### Comment pulse
- Overcomplicated forms as passive-aggressive gatekeeping → 30+ fields and rigid templates drive users away, often to send a plain email anyway.  
- Friction can be deliberate qualification → some firms add “painful” fields to filter out bad-fit leads and focus on their niche—counterpoint: many small businesses simply can’t afford fewer leads.  
- Hidden or hostile support is reputational debt → users see buried contact options as cowardice, though some note support at scale is genuinely expensive and must be triaged.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat contact flows as explicit expressions of business strategy; copy-pasting “enterprise” UX patterns without matching incentives is self-sabotage.  
- Impact: Small agencies, SaaS startups, and solo founders should A/B test plain forms vs. “self-serve first” layouts tied to conversion and retention data.  
- Watch next: Tools that quantify the revenue effect of support accessibility vs. deflection, plus better patterns for qualifying leads without feeling hostile.
