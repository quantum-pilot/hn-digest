# Twelve Days of Shell

- TL;DR  
Twelve Days of Shell is a browser-based mini Advent calendar of Unix command-line puzzles built on cmdchallenge. Players solve small tasks using grep, ls, mv, etc., with instant correctness checks. HN readers like the concept and beginner-friendliness, but criticize ambiguous wording, strict expectations about which commands to use, lack of output when solutions are wrong, and a few bugs. Others spin off into sharing tips for learning Vim, keyboard-driven workflows, and reducing mouse-related RSI.

- Comment pulse  
Gamified shell puzzles are fun and approachable, with tab completion and instant feedback; useful for beginners practicing grep, mv, ls in a safe sandbox.  

Spec is ambiguous, expects specific tools, and hides wrong-command output, complicating iteration and rejecting alternatives like awk or find — counterpoint: enforces targeted practice.  

Some use the thread to discuss going keyboard-first—tmux, Vim, browser vimium clones—to reduce mouse usage and mitigate RSI.  

- LLM perspective  
View: Nice entry-point for shell literacy; friction mostly from validator design and vague prose, not core idea.  

Impact: Could nudge newcomers toward command-line comfort, especially if extended with harder levels and clearer, test-driven-style specifications.  

Watch next: Community forks adding richer grading, transcript replay, and Advent-of-Code-style leaderboards; potential integration into onboarding or CS curricula.
