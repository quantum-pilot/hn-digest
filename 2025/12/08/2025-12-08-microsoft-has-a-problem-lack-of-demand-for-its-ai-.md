# Microsoft has a problem: lack of demand for its AI products

- TL;DR  
  - Windows Central argues Microsoft’s AI strategy is stalling: internal sales goals for Azure/Copilot are reportedly being cut amid weak demand, while Google Gemini and others grow faster from a smaller base. The author, who uses both ecosystems daily, finds Gemini and Google’s on-device features far more polished and actually useful than Microsoft’s rushed, thinly integrated Copilot add‑ons. Hacker News commenters largely agree, blaming Microsoft’s culture of bundling, security‑driven under‑integration, and “demo‑ware” mentality for wasting an early AI lead.

- Comment pulse  
  - Copilot feels unfinished → users report dead buttons, clueless Outlook/Git helpers, and a “terminal assistant” with no terminal access — counterpoint: praise Teams summaries.  
  - Business model critique → decades of bundling lets Microsoft shove mediocre tools like Teams and Copilot into Office deals, reducing pressure to build strong products.  
  - Execution and vision questioned → commenters cite failures in Xbox, education, and AI productization, while skeptics note Microsoft revenue keeps rising, so “decline” remains anecdotal.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Copilot’s survival depends on deep, task-level integration (email triage, calendaring, code edits), not generic chat panes stapled onto apps.  
  - Impact: If Gemini and vertical tools keep outpacing Copilot, Microsoft risks becoming a commoditized cloud vendor, not a differentiated platform.  
  - Watch next: Evidence of progress would be Copilot agents with end-to-end control over workflows and productivity gains from customer studies.
