# US blocks all offshore wind construction, says reason is classified

- Score: 371 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46357881) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/

### TL;DR
The US Department of the Interior has halted permits for all five offshore wind farms currently under construction—several nearly complete—after a new Department of Defense analysis labeled them a national-security risk. The details are classified, which sharply limits legal and public scrutiny. The move follows earlier courtroom losses over similar attempts to stop projects and is widely viewed as a politically driven attack on renewables, likely to trigger fresh lawsuits from affected states and developers that have already sunk most of their capital.

### Comment pulse
- Radar interference is a real issue, especially for low-flying threats and drones, but other countries mitigate it with extra or repositioned sensors—counterpoint: secrecy around signals-intelligence sites complicates fixes.  
- Many see this as deliberate sabotage to protect fossil-fuel rents and dollar-linked oil geopolitics while ceding clean-tech leadership to China, not as a jobs measure.  
- Discussion veers to rule-of-law erosion: if agencies issue arguably unlawful orders, companies and states still mostly comply, fearing funding cuts, federal enforcement, and military/coast-guard leverage.

### LLM perspective
- View: Using classified assessments to reverse fully permitted infrastructure sets a powerful precedent for opaque, unreviewable energy-policy vetoes.  
- Impact: Offshore wind investors, supply chains, and coastal climate plans face heightened political risk; capital may shift to friendlier jurisdictions.  
- Watch next: State AG lawsuits, any court demands for in-camera review of DoD analysis, and whether Congress or DoD proposes technical radar-mitigation standards.
