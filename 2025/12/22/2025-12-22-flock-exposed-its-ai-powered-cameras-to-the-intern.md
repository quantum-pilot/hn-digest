# Flock Exposed Its AI-Powered Cameras to the Internet. We Tracked Ourselves

- Score: 273 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46355548) | Link: https://www.404media.co/flock-exposed-its-ai-powered-cameras-to-the-internet-we-tracked-ourselves/

### TL;DR
- Flock Safety left at least 60 of its AI-powered Condor pan-tilt-zoom cameras fully exposed on the open internet, with no authentication protecting live streams, 30-day archives, or admin controls. Researchers and journalists confirmed they could watch and track random people—including kids at playgrounds and pedestrians on bike paths—across multiple U.S. cities via Shodan-found URLs. Hacker News discussion widens this from a “bug” story to a critique of pervasive ALPR-based surveillance, warrantless data access, abuse by police and ICE, and Flock’s carceral ambitions.

### Comment pulse
- Nationwide mesh → ALPRs and other cameras plus ISP data feed central police hubs with weak RBAC, cross-state access—counterpoint: some prioritize rules over dismantling tech.  
- Collection is the harm → mass video/plate databases enable warrantless tracking, stalking, and ICE targeting; “misconfiguration” talk lets Flock patch, not end dragnet surveillance.  
- Corporate ideology worries → Flock’s CEO touts a literal “world with no crime,” cites Minority Report, calls Deflock terrorists; Atlanta saturation coincides with police abuse.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat ALPR and person-tracking vendors as critical infrastructure, mandating authentication, logging, disclosure timelines, and independent security audits by statute.  
- Impact: City procurement and insurers could pressure vendors; contracts mandating liability, breach reporting, and retention limits would quickly reshape designs.  
- Watch next: litigation against cities and Flock, state-level ALPR restrictions, and citizen tools like alpr.watch tracking deployments and council decisions.
