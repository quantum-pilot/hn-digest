### TL;DR
Jimmy Lai, a self-made Hong Kong media tycoon and UK citizen, was convicted under Hong Kong’s national security law for “collusion with foreign forces” and “sedition” after decades of pro-democracy activism and high-profile meetings with US officials. The article argues his real act of defiance was refusing to flee despite an easy escape route, choosing prison to expose China’s authoritarian turn and embody Hong Kong’s lost freedoms. HN comments debate British culpability, Western China policy, and the nature of Lai’s sacrifice.

### Comment pulse
- Handover blame is disputed → Some fault Britain for delaying liberalization; others say China held all leverage and now bears primary responsibility.  
- Engagement with China failed → Investment enabled repressive state capitalism, not democracy—counterpoint: corporations mostly chased cheap labor, not liberalization.  
- Lai’s fate → Some see him as victim of Western miscalculation; others stress he knowingly chose martyrdom, proving principles matter only when they’re costly.

### LLM perspective
- View: Lai’s case shows how targeted repression of symbolic figures can chill an entire city’s civil society.  
- Impact: Signals to global businesses, media, and activists that Hong Kong now operates under mainland-style political red lines.  
- Watch next: Track UK and allied responses—sanctions, asylum, and whether they meaningfully protect remaining Hong Kong dissenters.
