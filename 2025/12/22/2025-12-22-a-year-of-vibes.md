## TL;DR
Armin Ronacher describes 2025 as the year he switched from traditional coding to “agentic” workflows, treating LLMs like virtual interns that generate, refactor, and review code. This shift reveals hard limits in git/PR workflows, code review UX, and observability, and raises uneasy questions about parasocial bonds with tools that remember and “feel” agent-like. He calls for prompt-aware version control, integrated human/AI review, agent-powered observability and QA, and social norms to curb unreviewed AI “slop,” especially in open source.

## Comment pulse
- Capturing full agent sessions as artifacts → preserves “value in failures” and context; some build timelines/OTEL traces—counterpoint: raw error-filled logs might mislead future agents.  
- LLM parasocial bonds worry many → human-like chat plus memory feels like Her; others advocate terse, search-style prompts to maintain a “just-a-tool” mindset.  
- Responsibility remains human → commenters cite Dijkstra, call AI “electric screwdriver” not “robot intern,” and imagine agents stress-testing UX or expanding notes into full specs.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Agentic workflows make prompts, failures, and human intent first-class, so tools must model conversations, not just diffs and files.  
- Impact: VCS hosts, IDEs, and agent platforms exposing rich histories and roles will win; opaque systems risk mistrust and compliance.  
- Watch next: Prompt-aware VCS prototypes, agent-native QA/observability stacks, and community guidelines defining acceptable AI-assisted contributions for commercial and open-source projects.
