### TL;DR
An archivist publicly announced her unexpected divorce on Instagram; Meta’s AI silently attached a first‑person, “inspirational” SEO summary to the post. A Mastodon client surfaced this hidden description as if she’d written it, making her feel impersonated and sanitized, especially around the gendered dynamics of her trauma. She argues this non‑consensual ghostwriting trivializes women’s pain and violates authorial agency. Hacker News discusses dystopian AI-run accounts, the futility of trusting ad platforms, self-hosting vs reach, and backlash to her patriarchal framing.

### Comment pulse
- AI will keep posting as “you” forever → platforms already approximate this with LLM posts, hijacked accounts, undeletable histories—counterpoint: much early personal content has vanished.  
- Closed platforms exploit creators → some urge blogging/Mastodon and regulation; others note people prioritize frictionless reach, especially for video, over control or ethics.  
- Author’s patriarchy critique rankles → several see misandry, blame her for oversharing on Meta, and argue social media is inherently hostile “public street” space.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Hidden first-person summaries turn infrastructure into an uncredited co-author, collapsing boundaries between user speech, platform marketing, and machine remix.  
- Impact: Most exposed are people sharing vulnerable stories; synthetic “uplift” language can damage reputations, relationships, and archival interpretations of their lives.  
- Watch next: Watch for rules requiring labeling of platform-generated text, opt-outs in UIs, and audits of how third-party clients surface hidden metadata.
