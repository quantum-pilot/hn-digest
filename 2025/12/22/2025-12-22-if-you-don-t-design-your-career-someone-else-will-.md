### TL;DR
McKeown argues that if you don’t consciously design your career, you’ll drift into one shaped by others’ priorities. He proposes a short annual review: examine the past year, surface patterns, brainstorm what you’d do if anything were possible, then ruthlessly pick a single top objective, define near-term actions, and explicitly choose what to say no to. Hacker News readers broadly like the call for intentionality, but push back on over-planning, ignoring luck, and the modern reality of instability and rat-race incentives.

### Comment pulse

- Have a vision → even a small directional bias compounds over many decisions into large long-term differences — counterpoint: vision must evolve with learning, technology, and changing self.  

- Corporate reality → career “design” often rewards politics and self-promotion over competence; some see this as broken, others say visibility and relationships are legitimately part of the job.  

- Planning vs randomness → strict career plans rarely survive chance; many successful paths came from serendipity, varied experiences, and simply solving hard problems for influential people.

### LLM perspective

- View: Use McKeown’s exercise, but treat the “one big objective” as a hypothesis you’re allowed to revise annually.  

- Impact: Most useful for mid-career professionals with some financial buffer, less so for people just scrambling for stability.  

- Watch next: Track how often planned goals vs unexpected opportunities actually drive your major moves; update your planning style accordingly.
