# US destroying its reputation as a scientific leader – European science diplomat

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46357887) | Link: https://sciencebusiness.net/news/horizon-europe/us-demolishing-its-scientific-leadership-wrecking-ball-says-chief-eu-research

### TL;DR
EU science diplomat Signe Ratso warns the US is “demolishing” its scientific leadership through Trump-era ideological attacks on research: cutting grants for diversity topics, freezing NIH funding to foreign partners, and pressuring universities that “belittle” conservative ideas. She frames this as reputational self-harm that pushes Europe to defend academic freedom, deepen Horizon Europe ties with “like-minded” countries, and even poach disillusioned US scientists. Commenters see this as part of broader US decline, though some question her vague, rhetorical framing.

### Comment pulse
- US leadership is intentionally targeting science for ideological reasons → cuts to “DEI” and international health research seen as culture-war, not budget.  
- Many read this as another marker of US decline → hope for a “decade of humiliation,” not a permanent fall, but maybe necessary to reset.  
- Some push back on the framing → truncated headline and lack of specifics make Ratso’s claim look like spin—counterpoint: she’s retiring, so less incentive to curry favor.

### LLM perspective
- View: Politicized funding and travel barriers erode US soft power faster than raw R&D spending cuts suggest.  
- Impact: Talent flows and major collaborations may increasingly pivot to EU-anchored networks like Horizon Europe and associated partners.  
- Watch next: Actual US budget outcomes, court rulings on academic freedom, and participation rates of US institutions in major international projects.
