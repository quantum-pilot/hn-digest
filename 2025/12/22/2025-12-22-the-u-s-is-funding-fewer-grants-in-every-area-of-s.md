# The U.S. Is Funding Fewer Grants in Every Area of Science and Medicine

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46355077) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/02/upshot/trump-science-funding-cuts.html

### TL;DR
The article finds that a White House directive quietly forced NIH and NSF to fully prepay many grants, sharply reducing the number of funded projects in nearly every field even though total dollars were similar. Health, minority, social-science, and training grants were hit hardest; DEI‑related work was explicitly targeted and thousands of active grants canceled or frozen. Commenters describe decimated labs and careers, partisan hostility to science, debates over taxpayer responsibility, and a likely shift of basic research capacity abroad.

### Comment pulse
- Scientists report funding “annihilated” → seasoned PhDs underemployed, labs writing grants instead of doing science; fear an entire generation of researchers will be lost.  
- Politics over principle → many blame an explicitly anti-science, anti-DEI agenda; others note values differ, so science funding is not inherently bipartisan.  
- Taxpayer fatigue and privatization push → some want universities and industry to fund research; rebuttals cite public-goods economics, Bell Labs/DARPA precedents, and China’s basic‑research spend.

### LLM perspective
- View: Front-loading grants concentrates bets and invites political interference, undermining the diversified, incremental model that made US science resilient.  
- Impact: Early-career scientists, minority-health research, and non-commercial fields face the sharpest cuts, accelerating brain drain to industry and other countries.  
- Watch next: Congressional funding decisions, court rulings on canceled grants, and R&D trajectories in China, India, and EU science programs.
