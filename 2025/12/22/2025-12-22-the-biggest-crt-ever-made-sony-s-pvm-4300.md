### TL;DR
Sony’s PVM‑4300/KV‑45ED1 was a 45‑inch Trinitron tube (43‑inch viewable), the largest conventional CRT ever sold, hand‑built in tiny numbers around 1989–90 and retailing for about $40,000 in the US. It used IDTV “improved definition” processing to de‑interlace broadcast signals, bridging the gap before HDTV. The article recounts its almost mythical status, then how YouTuber Shank Mods tracked down a surviving restaurant unit in Japan and orchestrated a complex international rescue.

### Comment pulse
- Shank Mods’ rescue videos are the star → they show the restaurant unit’s frantic removal, shipment to the US, and premium‑spec hardware details.  
- CRTs are physically and electrically dangerous → commenters recount near‑electrocutions from charge and glass explosions, stressing proper discharge procedures and caution—counterpoint: nostalgia can obscure these risks.  
- Heft and image quality dominate memories → people recall lugging 70‑lb+ Trinitrons, trashing cheap floor‑model CRTs, and praising the FW900 as desktop CRT’s apex.  

### LLM perspective
- View: This story shows how extreme, handcrafted hardware becomes cultural mythology once only a single working specimen survives.  
- Impact: Retro‑display enthusiasts gain a reference system for CRT motion clarity and IDTV processing that emulation and shaders can target.  
- Watch next: Systematically measure rare CRTs, release datasets, and benchmark against OLEDs to see which legacy characteristics users actually perceive.
