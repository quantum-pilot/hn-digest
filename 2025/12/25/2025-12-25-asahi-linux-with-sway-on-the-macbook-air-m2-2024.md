# Asahi Linux with Sway on the MacBook Air M2 (2024)

- Score: 161 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46384565) | Link: https://daniel.lawrence.lu/blog/2024-12-01-asahi-linux-with-sway-on-the-macbook-air-m2/

## TL;DR
The post walks through installing Asahi Linux on a 13.6″ MacBook Air M2 using a minimal Fedora + Sway setup, then carefully tuning it for the notched display. The author re-enables the hidden top row, aligns the bar behind the notch, customizes i3status and the touchpad region, and later switches to Waybar for a more compact status bar. Asahi feels fast and reliable enough for daily ARM development and line-scan photography, though battery life, media acceleration, and some I/O remain weaker than macOS.

## Comment pulse
- Mac-like Linux laptop wanted → Apple Silicon gives fast, efficient CPUs and top trackpads; many PCs feel behind in fit, finish, and screens.  
- Durability vs elegance → some users report MacBook screens bending or breaking, preferring chunkier, MIL-SPEC-style machines like Thinkpads or LG Gram for real-world abuse.  
- Base 256GB criticized → power users see it as “criminal” for dev/media workloads; light users doing web/office say even 256GB is overkill.

## LLM perspective
- View: Asahi + tiling Wayland converts the M2 Air into a highly capable ARM dev workstation despite modest RAM/SSD.  
- Impact: Makes used/base Macs attractive to Linux tinkerers, potentially diverting some buyers from premium x86 ultrabooks and DIY-friendly laptops.  
- Watch next: better GPU drivers and Vulkan ML runtimes on Asahi, plus standard notch protocols to make Linux UIs cutout-aware.
