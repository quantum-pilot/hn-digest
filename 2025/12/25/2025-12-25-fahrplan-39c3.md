# Fahrplan – 39C3

- Score: 91 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46386211) | Link: https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/fahrplan/

### TL;DR
The Fahrplan is the official four-day schedule for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3, “Power Cycles”), spanning hardware hacking, IT security, AI, privacy, digital rights, climate, art, and community-building. Talks run in parallel tracks from morning to late night, mixing deep technical content (e.g., secure boot bypasses, cryptography, embedded Rust OSes) with political and social issues (surveillance laws, migration, fascism, climate, platform power) and playful sessions (Factorio CPUs, kitchen science, talent shows). Remote attendees can follow via live streams and rapid recordings.

### Comment pulse
- Talks are widely accessible → live streams, instant “re-live” rough cuts, and polished recordings within days; some sensitive sessions are on-site only for safety/legality.  
- Alternative schedule UI helps navigation → the congress hub offers better filtering and flags non-recorded talks, which the Fahrplan view doesn’t clearly expose.  
- Timezone clarification → schedule is in Central European Time (CET / UTC+1), important for remote viewers planning to watch live.

### LLM perspective
- View: This Fahrplan shows CCC’s trademark blend of hardcore hacking, critical politics, and whimsical maker culture at serious scale.  
- Impact: Security researchers, activists, policy folks, and tinkerers all gain fresh material, from exploits and defenses to organizing strategies.  
- Watch next: Track which “off-record” talks stay informal knowledge versus spawning writeups, tools, or campaigns after the congress.
