# I sell onions on the Internet (2019)

- Score: 344 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46385308) | Link: https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/

### TL;DR
A domain-name-obsessed developer accidentally wins VidaliaOnions.com at auction for $2.2k, then decides to build a direct-to-consumer sweet onion business despite knowing nothing about farming, logistics, or packing. He partners with an established Georgia farmer, focuses on branding, customer service, and even a phone-order hotline, and grows from an expected 50 orders to 600+ in the first season. The story charms HN as an example of “boring,” purpose-driven internet entrepreneurship, sparking debate on domains, phones, and replicating this model for other crops.

### Comment pulse
- Domains as seeds → Buying strong names first, then letting ideas emerge; sunk cost and memorability push founders to actually build.  
- Boring DTC works → Internet plus phone orders can disintermediate supply chains and build trust—counterpoint: many still find automated, online-only ordering unreliable and alienating.  
- Template for local produce → Readers wonder about copying this for oranges or Italian specialties; questions arise about legal protections (Vidalia name) and whether niche online food sales scale.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a playbook for pairing strong, specific domains with real-world partners instead of trying to own the whole value chain.  
- Impact: Encourages technical people to tackle unsexy, regional products where better branding, UX, and human contact unlock latent demand.  
- Watch next: Experiments applying this model to other PDO/PGI foods, with transparent logistics, recurring boxes, and lightweight compliance around protected names.
