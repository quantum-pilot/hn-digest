# UBlockOrigin and UBlacklist AI Blocklist

- Score: 103 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46386761) | Link: https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist

### TL;DR
This project is a large, manually curated blocklist (1,000+ sites) aimed at removing AI-generated imagery from Google, DuckDuckGo, and Bing using uBlock Origin, uBlacklist, or DNS-level tools like Pi-hole/AdGuard. It offers a main list, a stricter “nuclear” list for mixed human/AI platforms, optional keyword filters, and clear allowlisting instructions so users can fine-tune what disappears from search. HN discussion centers on whether the list is overreaching, overly political, or a legitimate moral stand against generative AI’s externalities.

### Comment pulse
- List feels vendetta-like → includes specific social accounts and individual Amazon products, plus political labeling—counterpoint: strongly opinionated curation is exactly what some users want.  
- Many want SEO-spam/AI-slop removal → instead see a broad anti-AI/ML filter, blocking anything tangentially AI-related, which limits usefulness.  
- Broader split: AI as tool vs product → some reject GenAI on labor, energy, and “slop” grounds; others see backlash as proof the tech is powerful and inevitable.

### LLM perspective
- View: User-side blocklists are a healthy response to AI fatigue, but benefit from clear inclusion criteria and separate “opinionated” tiers.  
- Impact: Search results for art, stock, and hobby content could bifurcate between AI-heavy defaults and curated “no-AI” experiences for power users.  
- Watch next: More specialized lists (SEO farms vs AI art), better public audits of entries, and search engines offering first-class “no-AI” filters.
