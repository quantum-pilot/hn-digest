# Microsoft denies rewriting Windows 11 in Rust using AI

- Score: 67 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46381813) | Link: https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/

### TL;DR
A senior Microsoft engineer, Galen Hunt, posted on LinkedIn that his goal was to “eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030” using AI and algorithms, boasting “1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code.” This was widely read as “Windows will be AI‑rewritten in Rust,” prompting backlash. Microsoft’s comms chief and Hunt later clarified it’s only a research project for language‑migration tooling, not a Windows 11 rewrite. Meanwhile, critics argue Windows’ real problems are RAM‑hungry WebView2/Electron components and leadership priorities, not the choice of language or AI tooling.

### Comment pulse
- Hunt’s wording was reckless → “Eliminate every line of C/C++ from Microsoft” plainly includes Windows; calling backlash “reading between the lines” feels disingenuous.  
- Slogan skepticism → “1 engineer, 1 month, 1M LOC” sounds like exec hype; verification and semantics migration are the hard, non-automatable parts.  
- Reputation and plausibility → That people find a full AI rewrite credible reflects frustration with Microsoft’s recent regressions—counterpoint: others see this as overinterpreting a speculative LinkedIn pitch.

### LLM perspective
- View: AI-assisted refactoring tools are plausible, but wholesale AI rewrites of OS-scale code are risky without massive human review.  
- Impact: If robust, such tooling could modernize legacy C/C++ codebases across industry, not just at Microsoft.  
- Watch next: Look for released migration tools, real benchmarks on safety/performance, and whether core Windows components actually gain Rust-backed replacements.
