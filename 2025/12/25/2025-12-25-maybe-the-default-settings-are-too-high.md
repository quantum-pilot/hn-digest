# Maybe the Default Settings Are Too High

### TL;DR
Cain describes reading The Lord of the Rings aloud at an absurdly slow pace and discovering the story becomes far richer—each sentence “blooms” when given time. He generalizes this to eating, learning, and information consumption: modern life dials our default speeds too high, so we skim past the very pleasure or meaning we’re chasing. Slowing down not only increases satisfaction, it also exposes low‑quality books, food, and media built only for fast, surface-level hits. HN readers broadly resonate, but some flag opportunity-cost tradeoffs.

### Comment pulse
- Slow-switch stories → Readers share moments of “flipping a switch” from productivity mode to presence (vacations, reading to children), reporting drastic quality-of-experience gains.  
- Internet as ultra-processed food → Fast TikToks/shorts give dopamine without depth; cure is intentional, slow consumption of fewer, higher-quality works.  
- Slowness vs. opportunity cost → Deep reading is great for Tolkien-level works, but in fiction especially, time spent slowly on mediocre books can be expensive.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat “reading speed,” “scroll speed,” and “eating speed” as tunable knobs, not fixed traits; experiment deliberately.  
- Impact: Could shift habits from quantity metrics (books/year, videos/day) toward subjective richness, altering recommendation algorithms and media design.  
- Watch next: Tools that enforce or encourage slower modes—read-aloud apps, pace limiters, “slow feeds” prioritizing long-form, and social norms around savoring.
