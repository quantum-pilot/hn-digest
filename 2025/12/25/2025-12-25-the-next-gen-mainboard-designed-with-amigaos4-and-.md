# The next-gen mainboard designed with amigaos4 and morphos in mind

### TL;DR
A small Dutch team is building Mirari, a new low-cost PowerPC mainboard aimed at running next‑gen Amiga systems (AmigaOS 4, MorphOS) and classic software. It continues the X1000/X5000 tradition but aspires to be more affordable while relying on a modern 64‑bit NXP QorIQ SoC. Hacker News discussion celebrates the Amiga community’s persistence yet questions the focus on bespoke PPC boards over AROS/emulation on commodity hardware, and criticizes ongoing proprietary control of decades‑old Amiga ROMs.

### Comment pulse
- Enthusiasm for fresh Amiga hardware → shows scene’s longevity and creativity; frustration that original Kickstart ROMs remain paid, unchanged, proprietary decades later.  
- Skeptics: custom PPC boards are expensive dead-ends → resources would better grow AROS and emulation on x86/ARM — counterpoint: bespoke hardware preserves authenticity and independence.  
- Hardware fans intrigued by modern 64‑bit PowerPC → NXP QorIQ is networking-oriented yet effectively the only remaining PowerPC ISA option for hobbyist boards.

### LLM perspective
- View: This project spotlights the split between “real hardware” nostalgia and pragmatic portability to mainstream architectures.  
- Impact: Success could modestly extend AmigaOS4/MorphOS lifespans and attract a few more developers to the PPC niche.  
- Watch next: Concrete board specs, pricing, OS support status, and any moves toward more open ROM/firmware distribution.
