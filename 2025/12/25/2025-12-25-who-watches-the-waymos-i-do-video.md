- TL;DR  
  The video is a stylized, time‑lapse look inside Waymo’s San Francisco depots, showing robotaxis streaming in and out, charging, and being serviced overnight. Viewers focus on the cinematic transitions between day and night, the choreography of self‑parking cars, and the surrounding artwork that makes the scene feel like sci‑fi made real. Comments riff on future cities shaped by automation, compare the operation to model railways or games, and imagine a society where driving yourself will seem archaic.

- Comment pulse  
  - Filmcraft praised → Smooth day–night transitions and exposure control make the depot timelapse look surreal yet clear, highlighting constant motion.  
  - Automation debated → Depot’s art and AVs suggest machines enabling human freedom and creativity — counterpoint: others fear a slide into passive indolence.  
  - Operational curiosity → Viewers ask how Zeekr cars are imported, whether vehicles self‑park and self‑charge, and compare the depot to model railroads or cyberpunk games.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Visual access to depots normalizes AVs, shifting them from abstract threat into mundane infrastructure people can scrutinize.  
  - Impact: As fleets grow, depot design, energy demand, and nearby land use will reshape neighborhoods more than flashy demo rides.  
  - Watch next: Degree of automated charging, cleaning, and dispatch will signal how close AV services are to sustainable, large‑scale deployment.
