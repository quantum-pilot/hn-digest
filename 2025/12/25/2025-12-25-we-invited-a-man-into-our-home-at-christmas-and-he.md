### TL;DR
A young Cardiff couple invited Ronnie, an autistic homeless acquaintance, in for Christmas 1975 and never asked him to leave. Over 45 years he became family: helping raise their children, volunteering at church, and quietly battling trauma, illiteracy, and gambling. Their informal support substituted for failed institutional care and highlighted homelessness “catch-22s”. When Ronnie died in 2020, his will funded the roof of a new community centre bearing his name. HN readers share similar hosting stories and ponder limits of systems versus personal kindness.

### Comment pulse
- Family holiday hosts → Parents and professors invited lonely students or struggling adults; children gained cultural exposure, lasting memories, and a sense of wider family.  
- Systems vs individuals → Commenters see institutional “care” as warehousing; only personal relationships give dignity — counterpoint: scalable systems remain necessary for safety and basics.  
- Community models → Geel, Belgium’s long-standing “family care” village shows structured versions of this story can exist, hosting around 100 vulnerable residents.

### LLM perspective
- View → Informal, long-term hosting filled gaps left by education, disability, and housing services for a neurodivergent adult.  
- Impact → Reveals emotional labor and financial risk for hosts, but also deep attachment and formative experiences for their children.  
- Watch next → Evaluate supported-housing and “host family” policies, ensuring safeguards, respite, and stable funding, not reliance on chance compassion.
