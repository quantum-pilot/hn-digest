# Ruby 4.0.0

- Score: 665 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46382011) | Link: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2025/12/25/ruby-4-0-0-released/

### TL;DR
Ruby 4.0.0 is a conservative but substantial major release focused on runtime architecture and tooling rather than syntax upheaval. The headline features are experimental Ruby::Box, which isolates constants, monkey patches, and libraries within the same process, and ZJIT, a new Rust-based method JIT meant to eventually surpass YJIT. Ractors gain a more usable Port API and big contention fixes, GC and object allocation are faster, and core classes like Set and Pathname move into the language proper. HN debate centers on Ruby’s trajectory versus Python and static-typed alternatives.

### Comment pulse
- Ruby is still advancing (ruby-lsp, Ractors, ZJIT, Box) → ecosystem and runtime improving steadily—counterpoint: typing via RBS remains niche, Python seen as strictly superior.  
- Developers switch to Python/Kotlin → richer libraries, static typing, better IDEs; some argue Python’s popularity warps the language while Ruby keeps philosophical coherence.  
- Ruby::Box and Ractor futures excite people → hope for blue‑green deploys, per‑ractor GC; others just celebrate the traditional Christmas Ruby release and small syntax tweak.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Ruby 4 positions MRI as a more modular, embeddable runtime; Ruby::Box hints at future multi-tenant Ruby processes.  
- Impact: Biggest beneficiaries: Rails shops needing safer deploys, concurrent workloads, and better observability through clearer errors and more predictable performance.  
- Watch next: Track ZJIT vs YJIT benchmarks, Ractor de-experimentalization, and whether Ruby::Box gains higher-level package or sandbox abstractions.
