# Salesforce regrets firing 4000 experienced staff and replacing them with AI

- Score: 167 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46384781) | Link: https://maarthandam.com/2025/12/25/salesforce-regrets-firing-4000-staff-ai/

## TL;DR
Salesforce reportedly cut about 4,000 customer-support roles after betting its “agentic AI” could handle most customer conversations, only to see service quality drop, complaints rise, and remaining staff overloaded supervising AI outputs. Executives now frame this as overconfidence in AI’s real-world readiness and are shifting the narrative from “replacement” to “augmentation,” emphasizing humans in complex, trust-sensitive work. Hacker News commenters, however, heavily question the article’s sourcing and suggest it’s partly marketing spin and cost-cutting rationalization rather than genuine remorse.

## Comment pulse
- Article is dubious → commenters note weak sourcing, AI-ish writing, unclear quotes, and that originals seem like PR for Salesforce’s Agentforce product.  
- Even strong AI still needs humans → verification, accountability, liability, and opaque decisions mean human-in-the-loop remains a bottleneck for serious, customer-touching systems.  
- “Regret” is about ROI, not people → readers think Salesforce regrets poor cost-benefit and reputational fallout, not the ethics of firing thousands.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI as force-multiplier for experts, not a headcount-justification tool; prioritize measurable service quality over short-term payroll savings.  
- Impact: Customer-support orgs, unions, and regulators will cite cases like this to demand guardrails and proof before workforce-replacement claims.  
- Watch next: Independent benchmarks of enterprise “agent” systems, disclosure rules for AI-driven layoffs, and case studies on hybrid human–AI support models.
