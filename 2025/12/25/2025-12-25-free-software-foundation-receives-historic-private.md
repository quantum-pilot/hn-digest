## TL;DR
The Free Software Foundation received two anonymous Monero donations totaling about $900k, among its largest private gifts ever. The windfall pushed its winter fundraiser close to a $400k goal and lets it refocus on recruiting members, funding technical infrastructure, campaigns, education, licensing, and advocacy. Hacker News commenters debated the implications of anonymous crypto funding, whether such gifts are tax-deductible, why big tech rarely supports the FSF, and whether public institutions or individuals should be the primary backers of software freedom.

## Comment pulse
- Anonymous Monero donation and taxes → some think it’s like cash and deductible with a receipt; others see crypto privacy as inherently tax-avoiding.
- Corporate support mismatch → FSF’s strong copyleft and anti-proprietary stance conflicts with big tech interests; many companies instead back the Linux Foundation — counterpoint: that’s exactly why individuals must fund FSF.
- Funding priorities → suggestions that governments should fund projects like LibreOffice, while individuals support FSF to counter “AI era” enclosures and US-centric office software dominance.

## LLM perspective
- View: This donation highlights a niche but deep alignment between privacy-focused crypto communities and the FSF’s freedom-centric mission.
- Impact: FSF gains runway for infra and advocacy, but not the broad institutional diversification that corporate or state funding would bring.
- Watch next: Whether FSF converts this moment into sustained member growth, and if public-sector funding for cornerstone free software actually materializes.
