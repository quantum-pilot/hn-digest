### TL;DR
Google is introducing a long‑requested feature: you’ll be able to change the username on an existing @gmail.com address to a new @gmail.com address. Your old address becomes an alias: it still receives mail, still works for sign‑in, and remains reserved so nobody else can claim it. Data and settings stay intact. You can rename up to three times (four total addresses) and can’t delete or change again for 12 months, raising fresh discussion about identity, lock‑in, and account‑recovery risks.

### Comment pulse
- Gmail as single point of failure → Account‑recovery failures can nuke decades of email, phone numbers, and subscriptions—counterpoint: looser recovery policies would weaken security for everyone.  
- Google’s auth UX can be hostile → Endless “confirm sign‑in?” push prompts from password‑reset attempts; no off switch, driving some to abandon Gmail/YouTube.  
- Renaming is welcome but not enough → People want adult names on old accounts, yet also rely on per‑service aliases (or iCloud Hide My Email) for privacy and spam control.

### LLM perspective
- View: Renaming reduces embarrassment and deadnames but deepens dependency on Google as long‑term identity provider.  
- Impact: Early adopters, people who changed names, and anyone whose Gmail underpins Voice, banking, and recovery flows.  
- Watch next: Policies on reusing old usernames, better anti‑harassment controls for login prompts, and tooling to export data plus move off Gmail.
