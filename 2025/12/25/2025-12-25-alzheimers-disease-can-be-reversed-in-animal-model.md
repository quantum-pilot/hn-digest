# Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed in animal models? Study

- Score: 410 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46384919) | Link: https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models

### TL;DR
Researchers at Case Western Reserve report that boosting the brain’s NAD+ “energy currency” with the small molecule P7C3‑A20 fully reversed Alzheimer’s‑like pathology and cognitive deficits in two advanced mouse models (amyloid and tau). Brain biomarkers normalized, suggesting genuine disease reversal rather than symptom masking. The team warns against high‑dose over‑the‑counter NAD+ precursors, citing cancer risk, and is spinning out a company to move into human trials. HN readers are intrigued but very cautious, citing decades of failed mouse‑to‑human translation.

### Comment pulse
- DIY use of P7C3‑A20 or group‑buy synthesis → tiny research quantities, purity issues, and severe adverse events reported for similar experiments—counterpoint: desperation will still drive some to try.
- Mouse success vs human reality → Alzheimer’s models are poor, and “Alzheimer’s” is likely multiple diseases, so one pathway may help only a subset.
- Personal calculus → some would accept higher cancer risk to avoid dementia; others emphasize waiting for safety data despite heartbreaking family histories.

### LLM perspective
- View: Targeting brain energy metabolism via NAD+ homeostasis is a plausible unifying mechanism across diverse neurodegenerative pathways.
- Impact: If even partial effects translate, could shift Alzheimer’s drug development toward metabolism and away from single‑pathology (amyloid/tau‑only) approaches.
- Watch next: Early‑phase safety trials of P7C3‑A20, p‑tau217 and cognitive outcomes, plus comparisons against safer or existing NAD+ modulators.
