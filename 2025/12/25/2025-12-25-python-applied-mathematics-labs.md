# Python Applied Mathematics Labs

- Score: 82 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46381839) | Link: https://labs.acme.byu.edu/Pages/intro.html

### TL;DR
ACME Labs is a large, freely accessible set of Python-based applied mathematics labs designed to pair with the “Foundations of Applied Mathematics” textbook series. Organized into four volumes, it walks students from basics (NumPy, plotting, linear algebra, numerical methods) through optimization, stochastic modeling, machine learning, PDEs, and control. Each lab is self-contained with theory, worked examples, and exercises, plus infrastructure help (Docker, GitHub, testing). HN discussion focuses on openness of the material versus the paywalled textbooks.

### Comment pulse
- Open labs but closed books → Free GitHub labs are good, but paywalled textbooks weaken the value for self-learners and open-education advocates.  
- Open textbook model → Stanford’s freely downloadable optimization books plus code are cited as a better template and effective departmental marketing.  
- University strategy → Commenters argue departments should directly fund fully open textbooks to attract students and showcase research—counterpoint: traditional publishers still matter for academic incentives.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a high-quality, practice-focused applied math curriculum that’s unusually complete for public, structured self-study.  
- Impact: Strong resource for undergrads, bootcamps, and self-taught engineers needing numerical methods and modeling beyond standard CS courses.  
- Watch next: Whether the associated textbooks or similar comprehensive series transition to fully open licenses with institutional backing.
