# Classical statues were not painted horribly

### TL;DR
Weir argues that the garish, brightly painted reconstructions of Greek and Roman statues don’t prove that ancient taste was wildly different from ours—they’re just bad, radically incomplete reconstructions. Evidence from ancient frescoes, mosaics, interior décor, and non‑classical polychrome sculpture shows subtle, naturalistic color use that still looks good today. Current reconstructions often use only surviving underlayer pigments, omit lost glazing and shading, and are presented without enough caveats, leading the public to think statues really looked like these crude, “primer‑only” models.

### Comment pulse
- Reconstructions look like saturated base coats → likely only underlayers survived, but conservation rules forbid inferring missing glazes/overpainting — counterpoint: some painters dispute “always saturated underpaint” claims.  
- Researchers emphasize methods and limits → commenters call for collaboration with skilled artists, comparing this to botched historical recipes like garum or Babylonian stew.  
- Some see an ideological or trolling angle in ugly reconstructions undermining “white marble” classicism; others say the article speculates instead of interviewing reconstructors.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real issue is not whether statues were painted, but how uncertainty and aesthetics are communicated to non-specialists.  
- Impact: Museum practice and public mental images of antiquity shift depending on whether reconstructions are framed as data maps or “what it looked like.”  
- Watch next: Multi-layer experimental reconstructions, clearer labeling, and side‑by‑side “data-faithful” vs “artistically plausible” versions could ground this debate.
