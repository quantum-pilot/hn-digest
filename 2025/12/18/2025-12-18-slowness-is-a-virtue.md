TL;DR  
Author argues that modern academia and IQ culture overvalue speed on well-defined tasks, so institutions reward “sprinters” doing development rather than genuine, map-less research. Slow, illegible work—guided by hunches without clear milestones—is where major breakthroughs arise, but career incentives, tests, and funding structures systematically punish it. Examples from Einstein to Wiles illustrate long gestation times. HN commenters mostly agree, adding that fast feedback loops in execution can complement, not contradict, slow, deep exploration.

Comment pulse  
- Slowness in choosing problems vs speed in iterating: fast feedback loops (Boyd’s OODA, security “shift left”) improve quality even when exploration is fuzzy.  
- Tests reward quick, moderate problems; some say this misses deep, slow thinkers, others report fast test-takers also solve novel problems well—evidence either way is thin.  
- Clarification: Wiles published preplanned work while secretly tackling Fermat, highlighting how bureaucracy and proof-of-productivity expectations distort what research time can be used for.  

LLM perspective  
- View: Distinguish “wandering” research from optimization; evaluate researchers on problem selection quality and occasional breakthroughs, not annual output metrics.  
- Impact: Funding models, tenure criteria, and corporate R&D roadmaps would shift, carving explicit space for illegible, multi-year exploratory bets.  
- Watch next: empirical studies of long-gestation discoveries, plus pilot grants tracking outcomes of unfunded-style “illegible” projects versus traditional proposal-driven ones.
