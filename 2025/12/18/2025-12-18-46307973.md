### Comment pulse
- Single-purpose, pay-per-use utilities resonate → users appreciate no-login, no-subscription services that solve rare but painful tasks like faxing.  
- Media products need trust and transparency → audiobook users want clear narration sources and visible catalogs before subscribing — counterpoint: some are happy to try via coupons or samples.  
- Offline/community projects can scale → curated dinner clubs drive real revenue and social value, though margins, restaurant splits, and marketing channels remain key questions.
