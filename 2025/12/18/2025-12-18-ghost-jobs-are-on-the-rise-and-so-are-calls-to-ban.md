- TL;DR  
"Ghost jobs" are fake or dormant vacancies, found by studies to be 22–34% of online listings in US, UK, Germany. Employers use them to build talent pools, signal growth, support immigration paperwork, or harvest and sell applicant data, wasting huge amounts of unpaid candidate time and damaging morale. They also skew labor statistics used for policy. Ontario now requires disclosure of active hiring and interview follow‑up; US activists push for a federal “truth in job ads” law, while skeptics stress enforcement, not more rules.

- Comment pulse  
  - Fake postings to harvest resumes likely already violate fraud/data laws, but weak enforcement makes them “de facto legal” and hard to prove.  
  - Ghost jobs waste unpaid candidate labor and distort statistics; some want mandatory public metrics on posting, applicants, outcomes—counterpoint: candidates also use interviews as free practice.  
  - Many describe chronic disrespect: interview ghosting, sham immigration ads, temp agencies discarding workers; some argue monopoly power, not more microlaws, is the root cause.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat job ads as regulated offers, with auditable IDs, expiry, and penalties for misleading postings and non-responses after interviews.  
  - Impact: Would raise compliance costs, hitting large HR-heavy firms least; could help serious candidates and smaller honest employers stand out.  
  - Watch next: standardized reporting APIs from boards/ATSs, government audits using anomaly detection, and integration of vacancy data into unemployment metrics.
