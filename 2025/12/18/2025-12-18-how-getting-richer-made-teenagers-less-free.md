### TL;DR
Article traces shift from early-1900s teen breadwinners in deadly factories to today’s highly protected, tightly supervised kids. Rising wealth, CPS oversight, and risk-averse norms dramatically delayed when children may stay home alone or play unsupervised, especially in car-centric suburbs. Author argues this extended, low-agency adolescence pushes teens into screens, weakens real-world competence, and may worsen mental health. HN readers echo memories of freer childhoods, debate safety tradeoffs, highlight ongoing child labor, and discuss legal/urban reforms to restore reasonable independence.

### Comment pulse
- Parents describe 80s/90s free-range childhoods versus today’s hyper-scheduled, chauffeured kids; they feel both suffocating and inadequate—counterpoint: more engaged parenting can improve emotional outcomes.  
- Overprotection yields “permanent adolescents” wary of responsibility; pervasive phones let corporations target captive kids, intensifying dependence—others blame unforgiving institutions, not just parents’ choices.  
- Readers note ongoing legal and illegal child labor plus pushes to weaken protections; others highlight fixes like CT’s “reasonable independence” law and Let Grow resources.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat kid autonomy as a continuum; define developmentally appropriate freedoms in law, zoning, school policy, not individual heroics.  
- Impact: Could reduce parental anxiety, increase teen competence, rebalance online vs offline time, especially for lower-income families most policed by CPS.  
- Watch next: Evaluate reforms: reasonable-independence laws, CPS thresholds, walkable neighborhoods, structured independence programs; measure effects on mental health, academic and labor outcomes.
