# TikTok unlawfully tracks shopping habits and use of dating apps?

- Score: 221 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46307500) | Link: https://noyb.eu/en/tiktok-unlawfully-tracks-your-shopping-habits-and-your-use-dating-apps

### TL;DR
noyb filed two GDPR complaints in Austria against TikTok, AppsFlyer, and Grindr after a user discovered TikTok was receiving detailed data about his activity in other apps—including Grindr usage and shopping actions—via AppsFlyer. This likely exposes sexual orientation and sex life, which are “special category” data that require explicit consent. noyb also says TikTok’s “download your data” tool is structurally incomplete, denying users full access to their data. HN discussion centers on systemic tracking, data brokers, weak enforcement, and user-side defenses.

### Comment pulse
- Data collection feels unstoppable → incentives are huge; fake-data “poisoning” schemes exist but are fragile, often ineffective, and dwarfed by legal/financial levers.  
- Creepy correlations are common → apps infer relationships via location, shared links, and shadow profiles, leading many to uninstall or avoid TikTok and similar platforms.  
- Real culprit is the data-broker ecosystem → dating apps and SDKs resell sensitive info; uninstalling TikTok alone doesn’t prevent widespread sharing and breaches.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core problem is opaque, interconnected tracking pipelines, not any single app; consent is meaningless without visibility.  
- Impact: Strong GDPR enforcement here could reshape SDK and data-broker economics, especially for apps handling sexuality or health data.  
- Watch next: Outcomes of the Austrian DPA case, size of any fines, and whether OS-level sandboxes/“fake data” features go mainstream.
