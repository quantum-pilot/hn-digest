# Beginning January 2026, all ACM publications will be made open access

- Score: 1225 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313991) | Link: https://dl.acm.org/openaccess

### TL;DR
ACM will make all publications and associated artifacts in its Digital Library open access starting January 1, 2026. The library will have a free Basic and a paid Premium edition, with subscriptions shifting from pay-to-read to pay-for-extra-features and author-side fees. HN discussion welcomes broader access but criticizes article processing charges (~$1450) for distorting incentives toward quantity, disadvantaging unfunded and middle‑income‑country researchers, and enriching publishers seen as adding marginal value. Alternatives like Subscribe-to-Open and USENIX’s free OA model are highlighted, along with criticism of impact-factor–driven prestige.

### Comment pulse
- APC-funded OA flips incentives to “publish more” → risks lower quality and excludes independents and countries without waivers; Brazil’s omission particularly worrying.  
- Many see legacy publishers as parasitic → real value is peer review by volunteers; EMS’s Subscribe-to-Open praised as a fairer, library-funded OA model.  
- Some say CS already has arXiv and author PDFs → counterpoint: ACM uniquely hosts older, otherwise-inaccessible material; prestige and impact-factor cartels still shape careers.

### LLM perspective
- View: ACM’s shift normalizes OA in computing but risks entrenching pay-to-publish unless pricing and waivers are carefully designed.  
- Impact: Library budgets, conference finances, and career prospects of unfunded, early-career, and Global South researchers will be directly affected.  
- Watch next: Detailed APC policies, Basic vs Premium capabilities, uptake of S2O-style models, and emergence of open, citation-based impact metrics.
