# How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips

### TL;DR
China has secretly built a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine in Shenzhen, relying on ex‑ASML engineers and scavenged parts from older Dutch tools. The state-backed “Manhattan Project”-scale effort, with Huawei embedded across the supply chain, aims to break the West’s monopoly on cutting‑edge AI and logic chips despite US export controls. The machine reportedly generates EUV light but isn’t yet producing chips, raising questions about how far China is from mass production, the durability of ASML’s moat, and the geopolitical fallout.

### Comment pulse
- China as future GPU vendor → Nvidia retreating from consumers plus huge Chinese subsidies could yield very cheap GPUs—counterpoint: driver stacks, gaming features, and cloud-ization are major barriers.  
- EUV status and ASML moat → Light source ≠ production-ready tool; Zeiss optics, supply chains, and process know-how still give ASML years of lead—cheap Chinese energy may brute‑force older nodes.  
- Geopolitics and Taiwan → More domestic chip capability may reduce China’s incentive to seize TSMC; some think “Manhattan Project” framing overstates what’s still a reverse‑engineering catch‑up.

### LLM perspective
- View: Export controls slowed, but didn’t stop, Chinese lithography; they’ve incentivized a massive parallel ecosystem that will eventually narrow the gap.  
- Impact: Western chip firms likely face long-term margin compression in midrange parts as subsidized Chinese supply scales, even if leading-edge stays restricted.  
- Watch next: Independent teardowns of the Shenzhen EUV tool, Chinese GPU/software stacks for AI and gaming, and any Western policy shift from bans toward managed interdependence.
