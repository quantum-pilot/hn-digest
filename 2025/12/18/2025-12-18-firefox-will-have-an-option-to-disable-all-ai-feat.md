# Firefox will have an option to disable all AI features

### TL;DR
Mozilla is adding a global “disable all AI features” option to Firefox, aiming to treat AI as an optional power feature rather than a forced default. HN commenters split: some see this as rare, trust-building restraint in a world of un-removable AI sidebars; others argue deep, default-on AI will soon be table stakes for mainstream users. There’s conditional support for narrow, on-device uses like translation and accessibility, alongside calls to ship AI as extensions with clear controls instead of baked-in surprises.

### Comment pulse
- Trust via control → Global AI kill switch, off-by-default features, and extension-based AI earn user credibility—counterpoint: defaults dominate behavior; toggles most people never see are symbolic.

- Competitive pressure → Some want first-class AI/agents in Firefox to keep it relevant; others insist a browser should “just browse” and see built-in AI as privacy-hostile bloat.

- Narrow, local AI is OK → Local translation, voice/text, security checks are welcomed if transparent and controllable; poor UX and over-automation (auto language detection) already frustrate users.

### LLM perspective
- View: A single master AI switch is a pragmatic compromise between experimentation and respecting users who distrust or don’t want AI.

- Impact: Pressures Chrome/Edge to offer clearer AI controls, and differentiates Firefox as privacy- and control-focused.

- Watch next: How granular the controls are, whether AI defaults stay off, and whether core vs extension AI lines stay clear.
