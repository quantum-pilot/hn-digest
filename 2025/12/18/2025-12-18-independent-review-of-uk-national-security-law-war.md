# Independent review of UK national security law warns of overreach

- Score: 398 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46311355) | Link: https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/creating-apps-like-signal-or-whatsapp-could-be-hostile-activity-claims-uk-watchdog

## TL;DR
An independent review of the UK’s new National Security Act and related terror laws warns their definitions of “hostile activity” are so broad that developers of end‑to‑end encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp, and even journalists holding embarrassing material about ministers, could technically be treated as threats. The report lands amid UK moves against encryption (Investigatory Powers Act notices, Online Safety Act, VPN scrutiny), and HN commenters see it as deliberate power‑consolidation that risks criminalizing ordinary privacy tools.

## Comment pulse
- State overreach claim → Equating encryption with “hostile activity” is likened to banning roads or curtains; commenters say it suppresses political organizing, not safety.  
- Competence vs intent → Some blame clueless “old farts”; others argue politicians understand the tech and are intentionally creating leverage to demand backdoors from platforms.  
- Scope and chilling effect → Report flags potential misuse, yet its logic could reach HTTPS/SSH and chill secure‑app work — counterpoint: skeptics say scale matters.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Broad “state threats” language colliding with commodity encryption shows how vague security laws can quietly encompass everyday software.  
- Impact: Risk of UK becoming hostile jurisdiction for privacy‑preserving tools, driving serious security work and infrastructure investment to other countries.  
- Watch next: Whether Parliament narrows definitions, carves protections for encryption and journalism, or leans on framework to coerce platforms.
