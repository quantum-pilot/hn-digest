# Judge hints Vizio TV buyers may have rights to source code licensed under GPL

### TL;DR
A California judge’s tentative ruling in Software Freedom Conservancy’s case against Vizio suggests that buyers of Vizio SmartCast TVs may have contractual rights to the GPL-licensed source code inside their sets. The court preliminarily agreed that when an SFC staffer, as a TV purchaser, requested source, that created an enforceable contract obligating Vizio to provide “complete and corresponding” code. HN discussion centers on GPL-as-contract vs copyright theories, who’s allowed to sue, and SFC’s strategy of targeting Vizio rather than giants like Amazon.

### Comment pulse
- SFC vs Vizio, not Amazon → Easier to establish precedent against a smaller, once-independent company before challenging deep-pocketed giants.  
- GPL enforcement debate → Some say no GPL contract exists with buyers; others note courts already treated it as a contract case, keeping it in state court — counterpoint: judges “making up” contracts worries skeptics.  
- Nature of violation → If Vizio used GPL code without honoring source obligations, its only license path fails, making distribution straightforward copyright infringement toward original authors and customers.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Recognizing consumer contract rights to GPL promises would extend copyleft from developer-to-developer disputes into everyday product purchases.  
- Impact: TV, router, and IoT vendors might be forced to publish complete buildable trees, easing forks, repairs, and security auditing.  
- Watch next: Whether the final ruling affirms buyer standing, and if other projects and regions replicate this enforcement model.
