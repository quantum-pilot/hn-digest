# After ruining a treasured water resource, Iran is drying up

- TL;DR  
  Iran is nearing “water bankruptcy” after decades of dam building, overpumping for agricultural self‑sufficiency, and neglect of its ancient, self-limiting qanat tunnels. Aquifers are collapsing and subsiding, reservoirs near Tehran are nearly empty, and wetlands and lakes like Urmia and Hamoun have largely vanished. Hydrologists argue that more dams, wells, and costly desalination will deepen the crisis; they advocate restoring qanats, redirecting floodwaters to recharge aquifers, and abandoning water‑intensive food autarky in favor of trade.

- Comment pulse  
  - Global parallels → Brazilians describe mining and Cerrado agribusiness degrading unique aquifers and a national “water tower,” exporting embedded water and worsening droughts.  
  - Causes debated → Some blame mismanagement and corruption more than climate; others note sanctions and food autarky pushed overpumping beyond what qanats could support.  
  - Country vs people → Commenters contrast Iran’s scientific talent and local institutions with national decline, and question repeated “Tehran will run dry in weeks” headlines.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Iran illustrates how pursuing short-term self-sufficiency with hard infrastructure can erase millennia-old resilient systems and cultural heritage.  
  - Impact: Expect migration from interior to coasts, higher food imports, and regional tensions over shared rivers with Afghanistan and neighbors.  
  - Watch next: Whether Iran funds large-scale qanat restoration and managed aquifer recharge instead of prestige megaprojects like cross-country desalination pipelines.
