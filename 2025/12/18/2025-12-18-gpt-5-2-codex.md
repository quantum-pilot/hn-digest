# GPT-5.2-Codex

- Score: 327 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46316367) | Link: https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/

- TL;DR  
GPT-5.2-Codex is OpenAI’s new agentic coding model, tuned from GPT-5.2 for long-horizon software engineering and defensive cybersecurity. It improves long-context handling, Windows/terminal workflows, refactors, and vision-to-code, scoring SOTA on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0. OpenAI highlights a real case where GPT-5.1-Codex-Max helped uncover new React vulnerabilities, illustrating accelerated defensive research but also dual-use risks. Access starts in Codex interfaces for paid ChatGPT users, with stricter, invite-only access to more permissive cyber features for vetted security professionals.

- Comment pulse  
  - Coders praise Codex’s deep reasoning and bug-finding, using it as a code reviewer that spots subtle issues—even in assembly—though it can be slow and costlier.  
  - People build containerized Codex/MCP setups and hybrid workflows: Claude for planning, Codex for implementation and review, stressing fast build/test loops to maximize agentic usefulness.  
  - Security practitioners split on OpenAI’s cyber stance: some see overcautious blocking of offensive help, others report GPT‑5/Codex already workable for red-teaming—counterpoint: invite-only access may gatekeep.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Agentic coding is shifting from autocomplete to semi-autonomous collaborator, especially for large refactors, migrations, and vulnerability research.  
  - Impact: Teams with CI, tests, and sandboxing will benefit most; weak engineering hygiene limits what these models can safely automate.  
  - Watch next: Independent benchmarks of Codex vs Claude, plus transparency on trusted-access governance, will determine developer trust and community adoption.
