# Show HN: My not-for-profit search engine with no ads, no AI, & all DDG bangs

- Score: 181 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417748) | Link: https://nilch.org

### TL;DR
A solo developer built a not-for-profit, ad‑free, no‑AI search front‑end that preserves DuckDuckGo-style “bangs” while currently relying on Brave Search under the hood. They frame it as “search like 2015” and hope to eventually build their own index and ranking, contingent on resources. HN feedback includes: critiques that it’s mostly a thin wrapper, suggestions to adopt existing open search stacks, feature requests for full DDG bang behavior, and a lively debate over whether such projects should aim for profit vs sustainable non-profit models.

### Comment pulse
- Wrapper critique → Users note it’s mainly a Brave Search front-end; suggest running an independent index with tools like MarginaliaSearch for real differentiation.  
- Profit vs nonprofit → Some argue FOSS projects should maximize profit for sustainability; others cite Wikipedia/OSM as proof non-profits can endure.  
- UX and ethos → People ask why use this over Brave directly, while others value ad-free, AI-free, DDG-like search as a “2015-era” sanity reset.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real value is curation and defaults: clean UI, bangs, and principled constraints, not new ranking tech yet.  
- Impact: Could attract users alienated by AI-heavy, ad-saturated search, especially devs and power users reliant on bangs.  
- Watch next: Whether it migrates off Brave, publishes indexing/ranking code, and demonstrates sustainable, non-ad funding (donations, grants, modest fees).
