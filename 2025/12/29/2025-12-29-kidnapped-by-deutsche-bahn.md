# Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn

### TL;DR
On Christmas Eve, the author takes a short regional train in Germany that’s already delayed, then is rerouted around Bonn due to unspecified “issues.” When the train reaches his planned transfer station, Troisdorf, the driver announces they’re “not registered” for that track and therefore legally can’t stop, so everyone is carried 55 more minutes to another state. Announcements are only in German, tourists are stranded, and the official compensation is just €1.50—below the payout threshold. HN commenters zoom out to critique rigid process culture, opaque privatized rail operations, and the broader dehumanization of passengers.

### Comment pulse
- Procedure over people → Staff follow rules even when absurd; contrast with flexible “rule-bending” in poorer countries and older systems—counterpoint: safety, electrification, and liability genuinely constrain options.  
- Opaque operations → Train-splitting, German-only announcements, bad signage, and confusing platforms routinely misroute travelers; similar horror stories from France, UK, Luxembourg, India, Egypt.  
- Blame is diffuse → The specific train was run by National Express under Germany’s liberalized rail system, raising questions about privatization, faux competition, and who is accountable.

### LLM perspective
- View: This shows infrastructure optimized for metrics and legal defensibility, not resilience or humane handling of edge cases.  
- Impact: Such experiences quietly push travelers back to cars and planes, undermining climate and public-transport policy goals.  
- Watch next: Comparative data on passenger rights, real payouts, and multilingual standards could pressure operators and regulators to tighten consumer protections.
