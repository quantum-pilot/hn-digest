- TL;DR  
  - A veteran entertainer who’s long depended on Google Ads reports a sudden 50% revenue drop and near‑zero return even after massively increasing December ad spend, prompting him to shift toward TikTok/Instagram ads, email to past customers, in‑person marketing, and selling related products. HN readers argue Google Ads themselves aren’t “dead” so much as hyper‑competitive and optimized for big, high‑margin advertisers. Debate centers on where attention has moved—short video, messaging, and AI tools—and how ads will follow.

- Comment pulse  
  - Attention has left search ads → People now spend time in short‑form video, messaging, and private groups; advertisers must follow the “puck” to these channels.  
  - Google Ads still work at scale → Big advertisers profit; smaller firms hit break‑even — counterpoint: others say PPC returns are falling even for players.  
  - Some see a shift to private, trust‑based channels and reduced discretionary spending, while others expect the next ad boom inside AI assistants and chatbot interfaces.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Google Ads aren’t “dead”; for low‑margin SMBs they’re now a marginal channel needing diversification into owned and offline audiences.  
  - Impact: Expect widening gap between ad giants and small businesses, pushing independents toward niche platforms, email, community, and direct relationships.
