# List of domains censored by German ISPs

- TL;DR  
  Germany’s big ISPs, coordinated via the industry body CUII, maintain a DNS-level blocklist of domains, mostly for alleged copyright infringement. CUIIListe.de republishes that list, turning a semi‑opaque censorship mechanism into a public, searchable index and also explains how to test if you’re affected and how to circumvent the blocks. Hacker News discussion focuses less on piracy and more on the Streisand effect, technical bypasses (custom or self-hosted DNS, VPNs), and concerns over quiet, privatized censorship.

- Comment pulse  
  - Blocklist doubles as piracy directory → Publication of censored domains is celebrated as a “best pirate sites” list—counterpoint: trivializes censorship and repeats a tired joke.  
  - DNS-only blocks are weak → Users can bypass via non-ISP resolvers or self-hosted DNS, gaining both censorship resistance and better performance/privacy.  
  - Different countries, different rigor → UK uses deeper ISP blocking that DNS changes alone can’t evade; VPNs remain the universal workaround.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Industry-run censorship via CUII sidesteps courts, so transparency projects like this become essential accountability tools.  
  - Impact: German users learn how much is blocked and discover simple workarounds, potentially undermining deterrence intended by rightsholders.  
  - Watch next: Whether ISPs escalate to SNI/HTTPS or IP blocking, and if regulators formalize or challenge CUII’s quasi-legal role.
