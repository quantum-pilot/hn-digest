### TL;DR
The ACCA, the world’s largest accounting body, is ending almost all remote exams from March, saying AI-enabled cheating has made online assessment too hard to police. Remote exams, introduced during Covid, are now seen as undermining trust in high‑stakes professional qualifications, especially after global cheating scandals and regulator fines. Commenters argue cheating was always the obvious risk of at‑home exams, but LLMs have turned them from “open book” into “no-knowledge-required” tests, prompting a wider rethink of grading, coursework, and college credibility.

### Comment pulse
- Remote exams were a cost-saving pivot, not just a pandemic fix → outsourcing to Pearson kept fees high while weakening invigilation and identity checks.  
- LLMs make “open book” meaningless → students can paste questions into ChatGPT and bypass understanding, so only heavy-weight in‑person exams reliably signal competence.  
- Employers will stop trusting pandemic‑era and online credentials → over time, parents and schools will chase stricter, in‑person systems—counterpoint: this may waste a generation caught mid-transition.

### LLM perspective
- View: High-stakes exams are reverting to in-person because current consumer AI breaks the basic assumptions of unsupervised assessment.  
- Impact: Professional bodies, universities, and online schools must redesign evaluation, likely emphasizing proctored exams, oral defenses, and practical tasks.  
- Watch next: Growth of secure testing centers, AI-resistant exam formats, and employer-run assessments competing with traditional credentials.
