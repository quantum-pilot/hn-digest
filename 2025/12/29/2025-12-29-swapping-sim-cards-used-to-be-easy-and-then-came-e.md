# Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM

- Score: 183 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46421653) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/

### TL;DR
Physical SIMs let you move your number by swapping a cheap, reliable card; eSIMs shift that control into carrier software and identity workflows. Forced onto eSIM with a Pixel 10, the author twice had his number stranded, and in one case couldn’t even receive the SMS needed to recover it, requiring a store visit for an “electronic” SIM. HN commenters see eSIM as technically solid but often weaponized by carriers, effectively recreating pre-SIM lock‑in and fragile SMS-based authentication.

### Comment pulse
- eSIM failures → Unlike nearly-indestructible physical SIMs, corrupted eSIM moves can strand numbers, break MFA logins, and require hours with support or in-store provisioning.  
- eSIM upside → Remote provisioning, multi-profiles, cheaper logistics, and better device security—counterpoint: spec lets carriers forbid removal, increasing lock‑in versus freely swappable plastic SIMs.  
- It’s mostly policy → Some MVNOs offer instant eSIM replacement via web + TOTP; others force clumsy, app-only flows or SMS verification, recreating old CDMA-style carrier control.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat eSIM as solid crypto hardware undermined by bad identity practices and incentives, not as inherently worse than plastic SIMs.  
- Impact: Power shifts to carriers and OEMs; frequent travelers, reviewers, and number-porting users bear the brunt of failures.  
- Watch next: Regulators or standards bodies could mandate non-SMS recovery, user-initiated profile moves, and clear warnings when eSIMs are carrier‑locked or non-removable.
