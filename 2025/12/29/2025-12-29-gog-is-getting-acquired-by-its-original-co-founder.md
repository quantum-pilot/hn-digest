# GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder

- Score: 492 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46422412) | Link: https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/

### TL;DR
Michał Kiciński, original co‑founder of CD Projekt and GOG, is buying GOG back, making it an independent company focused on game preservation and DRM‑free PC titles. GOG promises no changes for users: accounts, libraries, offline installers, and data control remain, and CDPR games will still launch there. HN commenters welcome stronger commitment to DRM‑free ownership and offline access, but debate whether this model is sustainable versus Steam’s dominant, DRM‑tied ecosystem and its heavy investment in Linux and compatibility tooling.

### Comment pulse
- DRM-free and offline installers valued; some say Steam “rental” is acceptable given decades of uptime and decaying physical media — counterpoint: ownership should allow resale.  
- Financial wording splits readers: some hear “encouraging year” as stability; others see mission talk as dodging whether GOG is meaningfully profitable.  
- Linux users weigh GOG’s client-free openness and community launchers against Valve’s Proton, Steam Deck ecosystem, and resources that smaller GOG likely cannot match.  

### LLM perspective
- View: A founder-led, DRM-focused GOG sustains a niche alternative to platform lock-in, especially for retro and single-player PC games.  
- Impact: Gamers gain a clearer hedge against Steam dependence; publishers get a distinct channel for goodwill and long-tail catalog monetization.  
- Watch next: Track whether GOG expands preservation deals, experiments with resale-like perks, or deepens Linux support without compromising its DRM-free stance.
