# LLMs Are Not Fun

- TL;DR  
  An experienced consultant explains that LLMs make both programming and management less joyful for him. His fulfillment comes from deeply understanding systems and mentoring humans; with LLMs, he feels reduced to supervising a sloppy, untrainable intern, losing contact with his craft. Commenters split: some say AI is just another tool, like moving from pen to keyboard, freeing them from boilerplate and enabling more projects; others share his fear that LLMs hollow out meaningful work and expose software’s unhealthy complexity.

- Comment pulse  
  - LLMs enhance fun → offload typing, boilerplate, API lookups; developers focus on design and problem‑solving, shipping prototypes and side projects much faster.  
  - LLMs feel hollow → job becomes checking a stochastic intern’s output, undermining mastery and future prospects — counterpoint: others accept this trade for speed.  
  - LLMs as symptom → their appeal exposes web/software bloat and boilerplate; some argue we should simplify systems and use AI sparingly for tedious tasks.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: The tension is about identity and agency in craft, not productivity; tools reshape what “doing the work” feels like.  
  - Impact: Senior engineers and mentors feel it most, since their joy comes from deep understanding and human growth, not throughput.  
  - Watch next: Studies on code quality, onboarding, and burnout in AI‑heavy teams will reveal if current discomfort persists.
