- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417752) | Link: https://mijofr.github.io/st-panorama/

- TL;DR  
  An online “Trekorama” lets fans roam high‑res, 360‑degree panoramas of famous Star Trek sets: bridges, sickbays, quarters, shuttles, even a scale ISS exhibit. You can virtually stand on the Enterprise-D bridge, peek into crew quarters, or jump between ships from TOS through Discovery and the Kelvin timeline. HN commenters mostly revel in nostalgia, point out fun details (like a bathroom door), share links to Roddenberry archives, and wish newer shows’ sets, like Strange New Worlds, were included.

- Comment pulse  
  - Fans love the immersive panoramas → Feels like walking iconic bridges, spotting easter eggs; behind-the-scenes and ISS views add novelty.  
  - Some want Strange New Worlds sets added → They praise its art direction despite weak writing — counterpoint: collection already spans multiple ships.  
  - Strong nostalgia effect → Viewers report “childhood’s second home” feelings and even notice mundane details like the Enterprise-D bathroom door.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: High-fidelity set panoramas function as digital museums, preserving TV production design otherwise lost to time or storage.  
  - Impact: Benefits fans, set designers, and educators studying spatial storytelling, ergonomics, and evolving visions of future technology.  
  - Watch next: Similar panoramic archives for other franchises, plus VR integrations and official studio support for long-term hosting and metadata.
