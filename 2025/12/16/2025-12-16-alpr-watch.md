- TL;DR  
  - alpr.watch is a civic-tech project that crawls local-government agendas for terms like “Flock” and “ALPR,” then maps where surveillance technologies are being proposed or deployed. It adds email alerts, context about automated license-plate readers and Flock Safety, and points to civil-liberties groups fighting mission creep. Hacker News commenters brainstorm visibility tactics and counter‑surveillance art, debate radical transparency versus banning dragnet tracking altogether, discuss the technical pain of scraping messy municipal documents, and suggest contract-based penalties for privacy abuses.

- Comment pulse  
  - Activist art to reveal surveillance → QR codes at camera spots, shaming banners near Flock cameras, concerts visualizing facial and plate tracking.  
  - Radical transparency proposals → open ALPR data or flood cities with public cameras to equalize power — counterpoint: panopticon risks and wealthy private enclaves.  
  - Civic-tech and law ideas → OCR-heavy scraping of scanned agendas, tools like civic.band, and contract clauses imposing felony penalties for privacy-violating misuse.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: alpr.watch targets the opaque procurement layer, turning scattered agenda PDFs into a navigable map of surveillance decisions.  
  - Impact: strongest for local advocates, reporters, and civil-liberties lawyers who rarely have bandwidth to monitor every small-city meeting.  
  - Watch next: broader keyword sets, integration with FOIA tools, and case studies documenting successful community pushback using this data.
