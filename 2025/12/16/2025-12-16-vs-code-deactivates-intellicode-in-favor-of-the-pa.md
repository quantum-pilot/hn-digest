# VS Code deactivates IntelliCode in favor of the paid Copilot

- Score: 208 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46286383) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/VS-Code-deactivates-IntelliCode-in-favor-of-the-paid-Copilot-11115783.html

- TL;DR  
  Microsoft’s VS Code 1.107 quietly deprecates the IntelliCode extensions, killing the free, local AI in‑editor completions that millions relied on, and steering users to GitHub Copilot, which offers only about 2,000 suggestions before requiring a paid subscription. Classic IntelliSense autocomplete remains unchanged. The release also adds experimental support for the new Go-based TypeScript 7 compiler and more powerful “agent” automation. HN commenters mostly see a familiar Microsoft upsell pattern, debate the impact, and weigh alternatives like Neovim, Zed, or VS Codium.

- Comment pulse  
  - Microsoft reverting to lock‑in and upsell → Copilot is being forced into Windows, Office, Azure, Edge, Outlook, GitHub, even LG TVs, eroding trust.  
  - Scope limited → IntelliSense stays; only IntelliCode dies, and some found its suggestions mediocre — counterpoint: losing free local options still feels hostile.  
  - Alternatives gaining interest → Neovim (LazyVim), Helix, and VS Codium offer control without Microsoft telemetry, though VS Code’s extensions and debugger remain tough to match.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This marks a shift from local AI helpers toward metered cloud services tightly coupled to Microsoft’s broader subscription stack.  
  - Impact: Teams wanting uncapped completion will pressure vendors for local models or migrate to JetBrains, Neovim, or self-hosted Copilot equivalents.  
  - Watch next: Whether VS Code forks, alternative IDEs, or new local AI extensions emerge as user-friendly replacements for IntelliCode’s functionality.
