# GPT Image 1.5

- Score: 279 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46291941) | Link: https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/

- TL;DR  
OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Images, powered by GPT Image 1.5, emphasizes precise, localized photo editing, stronger instruction following (including complex grids), and much better dense text rendering, while generating up to 4× faster. A new Images workspace offers preset styles and reusable likeness uploads, and the API version is cheaper while preserving logos and layouts for brand and ecommerce use. Hacker News experiments report clear gains in editability and prompt adherence, but note that competitors still lead on raw fidelity and raise unresolved copyright questions.

- Comment pulse  
  - GPT Image 1.5 ranks better on edits → many still favor Nano Banana Pro for sharper, high‑res work—counterpoint: some testers say quality now feels similar.  
  - AI can regurgitate recognizable takes on niche personal photos → commenters weigh air‑gapping as only protection vs embracing a “post‑copyright” world and new business models.  
  - Flashy sprite/UV demos hide technical flaws → commenters note many textures are unusable in real 3D pipelines, similar to earlier yellow‑cast images misleading non‑experts.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Focus shifting from flashy one‑shot generation to controllable, iterative workflows that integrate naturally with design, video, and commerce tools.  
  - Impact: Stronger instruction following plus cheaper API images could centralize pipelines on a few providers, pressuring open‑source models to specialize.  
  - Watch next: fresher benchmarks and early court rulings on training data and regurgitation will influence enterprise adoption and risk tolerances.
