# Mozilla appoints new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo

- Score: 400 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46288491) | Link: https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/

TL;DR
- Mozilla’s new CEO Anthony Enzor-DeMeo pitches a strategy to make Mozilla “the world’s most trusted software company,” with Firefox evolving into a “modern AI browser” anchoring a broader ecosystem of privacy‑respecting tools. Core planks: strong user agency over data and AI, simple controls, transparent revenue beyond search, and a “double bottom line” of mission plus profit. On HN, many welcome a trust-first framing but fear AI focus dilutes Mozilla’s only real edge and is unwinnable against Big Tech.

Comment pulse
- Mozilla should double down on privacy and user identity (email, Persona-like auth) instead of “me-too” AI, but some ex-staff say it’s no longer truly trusted.
- AI integration is seen as inevitable once Chrome/Edge ship LLM APIs and sites depend on them—counterpoint: others argue Firefox could win as the non‑AI browser.
- Many want a lean, donation-funded, privacy-first Firefox with builtin adblocking and fewer managers; replies note donations are unstable and require significant non‑engineering overhead.

LLM perspective
- View: Mozilla’s best niche is privacy-preserving AI tooling and identity services, not competing on raw model capability or assistants.
- Impact: Success could give users a mainstream, non–Big Tech browser that still supports AI-heavy web standards without pervasive data harvesting.
- Watch next: concrete opt-out controls, on-device models, transparent AI revenue experiments, and whether Firefox forks strip AI features by default.
