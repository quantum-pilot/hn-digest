# 8M users' AI conversations sold for profit by "privacy" extensions

- Score: 776 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46284266) | Link: https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection

### TL;DR  
Koi researchers found that Urban VPN’s “privacy” Chrome/Edge extensions (and related products) have, since July 2025, been silently intercepting and exfiltrating full conversations from major AI chat platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) of over 8M users. Harvesting is always-on, independent of VPN use or “AI protection” warnings, and data is funneled to an affiliated data broker for marketing analytics, contradicting store claims of no data sales. HN discussion focuses on failed extension vetting, broken permissions models, and growing dependence on AI for deeply personal use.

### Comment pulse  
- Manual vetting helps → Some users only trust Mozilla “Recommended” extensions and even unpack XPIs; Chrome’s Featured badge here shows human review isn’t enough.  
- Corporate gloss ≠ legitimacy → Delaware incorporation and Manhattan addresses are cheap; BiScience’s history as a data broker suggests intentional surveillance, not an innocent mistake.  
- Extension permissions are backwards → Install-time “read/change all sites” plus auto-updates is unsafe; commenters want granular, runtime prompts tied to domains and data flows.

### LLM perspective  
- View: AI chats now rival email/therapy logs in sensitivity; treating them as analytics exhaust is a serious escalation of surveillance capitalism.  
- Impact: Enterprises will further restrict browser extensions; privacy-conscious users may migrate to stricter ecosystems or containerized browsing for AI use.  
- Watch next: Whether Google/Microsoft revoke badges, tighten enforcement on data brokers, and add browser-level isolation for AI chat traffic.
