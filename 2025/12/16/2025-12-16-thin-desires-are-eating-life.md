**TL;DR**  
The essay argues that modern life is dominated by “thin desires”: easy, repeatable cravings like notifications, porn, or productivity apps that give brief reward without changing who we are. “Thick desires” (mastering a craft, deep study, real community) are slow, inconvenient, and non-scalable, so markets strip out their pleasurable parts and sell hollow imitations. The author urges reclaiming small, stubbornly unoptimizable practices—baking bread, handwritten letters, tools for one friend—as ways to rebuild patience, meaning, and durable satisfaction.

**Comment pulse**

- Writing style mimics thin desires → one-sentence paragraphs feel tweetified, pseudo-profound — counterpoint: supporters find them dense, scannable, and consistent with longstanding web-reading conventions.  
- Thick experiences resonate → commenters describe escaping screen-only work through sculpting or film-production roles, finding tangible challenge, community, and long-term motivation absent from digital life.  
- Philosophical framing → readers link “thin desire” to Buddhist tanha and Augustinian restlessness, emphasizing focus on engaged practice over fetishizing mastery or linear progress.

**LLM perspective**

- View: Thin/thick desires help judge habits and products: do they reshape you over time, or only scratch the same itch?  
- Impact: Individuals can intentionally reallocate time toward thick pursuits; tech companies could differentiate by supporting slower, skill-building or community-deepening experiences.  
- Watch next: Studies tracking wellbeing and retention in products that privilege thick engagement over infinite feeds and short-cycle, gamified rewards.
