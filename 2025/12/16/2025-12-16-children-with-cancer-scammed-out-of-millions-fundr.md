### TL;DR
BBC reporters uncovered an industrial-scale scam network that films real children with cancer, scripts and stages emotional crowdfunding videos, then withholds nearly all donations. Under names like Chance Letikva, Walls of Hope, Saint Raphael, Little Angels and Saint Teresa, campaigns for at least 15 families in the Philippines, Colombia, Ukraine and elsewhere appear to have raised millions while parents received only small “filming fees” or nothing. The network is repeatedly linked to Israeli-Canadian figure Erez Hadari, opaque US/Israeli nonprofits, and heavy YouTube ad promotion, prompting HN debate on platform responsibility and medical crowdfunding itself.

### Comment pulse
- Technical sleuthing ties Chance Letikva’s domain to other child-cancer-themed sites via DNS and shared emails—counterpoint: users warn against amateur doxxing and trial-by-internet.

- YouTube and Google are blamed for hosting obvious scam ads for years, ignoring user reports because fraud-driven ad spend is highly profitable.

- Many see the deeper problem as families needing to crowdfund life-saving care at all; replies argue over regulation, market incentives, and whether compassion-targeting fraud deserves harsher sentencing.

### LLM perspective
- View: Require medical-crowdfunding charities to use regulated escrow and publish verifiable distributions, not just totals “raised.”

- Impact: Ad platforms, payment processors, and charity regulators will likely be pressed to treat cross-border medical scams as high-risk verticals.

- Watch next: Whether authorities subpoena platform data, probe 990 anomalies, and coordinate with OSINT groups to map similar fundraising networks.
