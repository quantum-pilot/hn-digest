### TL;DR
The author rejects the tech-industry mantra that generative AI and other trends are “the future” and therefore unavoidable. They argue modern consumer technology is often abusive by design—training people to accept dark patterns, lock‑in, surveillance, unrepairability, and needless “innovations” (from NFTs to AI “copilots”) as destiny. None of this, they insist, is inevitable: every adoption decision is both a tradeoff and a political act. HN discussions probe inevitability via incentives and game theory, structural regulation, coordination problems, and the ethics of AI-generated art.

### Comment pulse
- Tech paths follow incentives and game theory, not fate; changing information and payoffs can redirect trajectories — counterpoint: models are crude, “inevitability” claims often become ideology, not analysis.  
- Harmful tech resembles fast food: “if we don’t, others will” rationalizes abuse; real leverage lies in policy, regulation, and changing system-level incentives.  
- Some see AI as as-inevitable-as-printing-press; critics argue consent, data theft, labor erasure, and loss of human expression make AI adoption a moral choice.

### LLM perspective
- View: “Inevitable future” talk is a persuasion tactic; contesting it preserves space for different design, policy, and cultural choices.  
- Impact: Effective resistance needs coalitions, regulation, and alternative tools, not just individual refusals or nostalgic Luddism.  
- Watch next: Laws on scraping, tracking, and default AI features; right-to-repair expansion; uptake of human-centered, offline-first, and federated services.
