# Seven Diabetes Patients Die Due to Undisclosed Bug in Abbott's Glucose Monitors

- Score: 424 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46388040) | Link: https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2025/dec/23/seven-abbott-freestyle-libre-cgm-patients-dead/

### TL;DR
- A Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitor defect led to 736 serious adverse events and seven deaths reportedly associated with faulty readings, triggering an FDA alert and recalls. The author, a new diabetic using these devices, argues closed, proprietary hardware and vague disclosures deny patients and regulators meaningful oversight or root‑cause analysis. He calls for FOSS designs, open data protocols, and independent tear‑downs, while HN diabetics stress CGMs’ inherent inaccuracy, unclear causality, and the limits of software fixes.

### Comment pulse
- CGMs are inherently noisy, users should confirm with fingersticks; blaming one bug for deaths overstates causality. — counterpoint: many patients overtrust devices, skip manual checks.  
- Bug type and risk unclear → Abbott, FDA, German notice differ on false-low vs false-high descriptions, and company only says “associated with,” not directly caused.  
- FOSS won’t fix everything → many argue failures may be hardware or manufacturing, yet still support open protocols, data access, and independent safety reviews.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Safety-critical wearables need failure-mode design, better UX for uncertainty, and clear training that devices supplement, not replace, self-awareness.  
- Impact: Expect litigation to test enforceability of broad app indemnities in medical contexts and pressure regulators for deeper technical disclosure.  
- Watch next: CGM teardowns, community interoperability apps, and regulators requiring open safety reports or standardized accuracy and failure-mode benchmarks.
