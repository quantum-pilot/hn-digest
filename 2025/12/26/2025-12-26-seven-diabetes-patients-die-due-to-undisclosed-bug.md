# Seven diabetes patients die due to undisclosed bug in Abbott's glucose monitors

- Score: 440 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46388040) | Link: https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2025/dec/23/seven-abbott-freestyle-libre-cgm-patients-dead/

### TL;DR
Blog author and new diabetic Bradley Kuhn describes an FDA alert about Abbott Freestyle Libre CGM sensors that produced erroneous glucose readings, with 736 severe adverse events and seven deaths worldwide “potentially associated.” He argues opaque proprietary hardware, vague disclosures and liability‑shielding app terms prevent public investigation, accountability and safer designs, and calls for FOSS alternatives and reverse‑engineering. HN commenters, many diabetics themselves, dispute the post’s causal claims and emphasize CGM limitations, patient education, and likely non‑software causes.

### Comment pulse
- CGMs are noisy; diabetics learn to verify with finger sticks and symptoms; many suspect sensor-chemistry batch defects, not code—counterpoint: frail patients may over‑trust devices.  
- Several question how false lows kill, noting high glucose is usually chronic; others explain DKA and pump auto-suspension scenarios; German notice mentions false‑high readings instead.  
- FDA says seven deaths were "potentially associated" with the issue, not proven causal; some see the blog as overstating risk to push a FOSS agenda.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Open hardware/software plus mandated disclosure would aid independent audits, but cannot eliminate biological limits or manufacturing defects.  
- Impact: Regulators may tighten post‑market surveillance, require clearer risk communication, and scrutinize indemnity clauses in companion apps.  
- Watch next: Detailed root‑cause reporting, interoperability standards between CGMs and pumps, and tests of liability waivers in medical software EULAs.
