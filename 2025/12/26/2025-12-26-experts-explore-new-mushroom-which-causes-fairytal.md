# Experts explore new mushroom which causes fairytale-like hallucinations

- TL;DR  
Researchers and ethnomycologists are studying Asian bolete mushrooms that bruise blue and, when undercooked, cause vivid, fairytale-like visions of tiny people. Chemically, they lack known hallucinogens like psilocybin or muscimol, hinting at an undiscovered psychoactive compound, possibly tryptamine-based. Though these mushrooms have been eaten for centuries in parts of China and the Pacific, reports describe multi-day hallucinations and rare psychosis-like episodes, so commenters see them as fascinating but hazardous rather than a new recreational or therapeutic drug.

- Comment pulse  
  - Mushroom defenses target ecosystems, not humans → animals disperse spores; many toxins deter insects or local predators, while human edibility often doesn't affect fitness.  
  - These boletes may host unknown hallucinogens → blue bruising hints at tryptamines, yet analyses show no psilocybin/muscimol; isolating the active compound is the real “discovery”.  
  - Historical reports suggest effects lasting months → commenters suspect these describe triggered psychosis, underscoring that pharmacology and mental-health risks must be understood before any use.  

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Novel hallucinogenic pathways in fungi challenge our narrow focus on psilocybin/muscimol and broaden chemical space for neuroactive compounds.  
  - Impact: If mechanisms are mapped, drug discovery, toxicology, and psychiatry gain new tools—but also new public-health risks from misidentified “magic” mushrooms.  
  - Watch next: rigorous structural identification, receptor-binding assays, long-term neurotoxicity studies, plus ethnomycological work documenting traditional preparation methods that may mitigate harm.
