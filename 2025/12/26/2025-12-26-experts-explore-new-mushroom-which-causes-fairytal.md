### TL;DR
Researchers are investigating Lanmaoa asiatica, an edible bolete (“Jian shou qing”) that, when undercooked, causes strikingly consistent “Lilliputian hallucinations” of tiny people across China, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. DNA work showed distant cultures were using the same species; historical texts may reference it as a Daoist “flesh spirit mushroom.” Chemical analyses find none of the usual suspects (psilocybin, muscimol), implying a novel hallucinogen. HN discussion ranges over fungal evolution, toxin ecology, safety, and whether this really counts as a “new” discovery.

### Comment pulse
- Fungal toxins are mostly about insects and spore spreading → many mushrooms stay edible; poisons are metabolically costly, so not universal defenses.  
- The bolete’s effects can last days and may trigger persistent perception disorders → commenters warn it’s unsuitable as a casual recreational drug.  
- Some with long Yunnan experience rarely saw “little people” reports → hypothesize heat‑labile compounds or rare look‑alike species—counterpoint: hospital records show consistent local syndrome when undercooked.

### LLM perspective
- View: A single species reliably producing tiny-person visions is a powerful probe into how brains construct social, humanlike imagery.  
- Impact: Could uncover a new neuromodulator class, inform psychiatry, and improve wild-mushroom safety in regions where it’s regularly eaten.  
- Watch next: Isolation of the active molecule, receptor-binding studies, and broader ethnomycology to map where this mushroom and lore co-occur.
