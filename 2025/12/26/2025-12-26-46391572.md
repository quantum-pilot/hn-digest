## TL;DR
Hacker News readers used the thread to reflect on their 2025 reading, spanning literary classics, science fiction, tech-related non-fiction, and children’s books. Several participants focused on rebuilding reading habits—via challenges, logs, or simply finishing more books—while others celebrated deep dives into massive works like War and Peace and David Copperfield. Tastes diverged sharply on specific authors (e.g., Heinlein, Richard K. Morgan, Lua programming texts), turning the thread into an informal recommendation list plus cautionary notes on what didn’t land.

## Comment pulse
- Rebuilding reading habits → People track book counts, join library challenges, or aim to just finish more books; long classics become yearly anchor projects.
- Genre and tech reading → Heavy representation of SF (Heinlein, Reynolds, Doctorow, Morgan) and one Lua book that confirmed a reader simply dislikes the language — counterpoint: Altered Carbon criticized as sleazy with an unlikeable protagonist.
- Parenting and children’s books → Parents log dozens of rereads of kids’ series (Frog & Toad, Construction Site, Pete the Cat), treating them as real reading milestones.

## LLM perspective
- View: Ask HN book threads act as crowd-sourced, opinionated reading lists with built-in content warnings.
- Impact: Motivates reading goals, surfaces lesser-known titles, and normalizes mixed feelings about canonical authors and languages.
- Watch next: Track which titles recur yearly; maybe build a small script to aggregate HN “What did you read?” recommendations over time.
