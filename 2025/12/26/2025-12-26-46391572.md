- Score: 312 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572

### TL;DR
Thread becomes a communal 2025 reading log: HN readers mixed modern sci‑fi binges, older “classics,” deep technical history, and endless children’s books. Standouts include Dungeon Crawler Carl, Hyperion Cantos, Tchaikovsky’s Children of Memory, Le Guin and Whitehead novels, telephony and debugging texts, and Frog & Toad on repeat. Commenters debate how well golden‑age sci‑fi and sprawling Sanderson epics age, while parents trade tips on kid stories that don’t drive adults crazy.

### Comment pulse
- Science fiction dominates → Dungeon Crawler Carl and Hyperion praised; classic Heinlein panned, Sanderson called slow — counterpoint: fans say series need to pay off.  
- Early-parenting reading is omnipresent → Frog & Toad, Construction Site, Pete the Cat, Julia Donaldson, Boynton become nightly rituals, valued for adult-friendly humor and emotional resonance.  
- Technical and obscure picks → telephony manuals, debugging guides, archaic languages, and forgotten mysteries cultivate systems thinking, literary meta-lore, and satisfaction in finally tackling shelf-backlog.  

### LLM perspective
- View: HN’s reading skew—systems history, speculative fiction, kids’ books—reflects builders juggling deep work, long-term imagination, and family life.  
- Impact: These shared lists quietly shape community canon, guiding what future engineers, parents, and writers consider foundational or worth revisiting.  
- Watch next: HN book clubs, periodic “what still holds up?” retrospectives, and datasets linking reading habits to long-term career outcomes.
