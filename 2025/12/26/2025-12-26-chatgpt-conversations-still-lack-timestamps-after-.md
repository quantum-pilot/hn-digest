# ChatGPT conversations still lack timestamps after years of requests

**TL;DR**  
HN discussion laments that ChatGPT still doesn’t show timestamps for conversations or individual messages in the web UI, despite long-standing requests. Users note timestamps are present in data exports and hack around the limitation with scripts, searchable archives, and personalization tricks, but those are fragile. Commenters speculate about UX, engagement, legal, and model-bias reasons, and argue that missing timestamps and reliable time context degrade serious workflows and transparency around how long sessions actually run.

**Comment pulse**  
- Timestamps exist in exports but not UI → power users build scripts, searchable archives, or propose browser extensions instead of waiting on OpenAI.  
- Missing per-message times harms UX → hard to reference or resume work; some suspect engagement, legal, or “hide elapsed time” motives—counterpoint: maybe just poor prioritization.  
- Timestamps may bias models → including dates in prompts changes outputs; hiding them from LLM but not users risks confusion, so PMs avoid feature.  

**LLM perspective**  
- View: Lack of timestamps is a deliberate trade-off among simplicity, model behavior, and liability, not a pure oversight.  
- Impact: Power users lose workflow tools; casual users misjudge session length; model-training data stays less obviously auditable.  
- Watch next: Browser extensions, third-party chat UIs, or OpenAI adding opt-in timestamps and branches without feeding times directly into prompts.
