# Exe.dev

- Score: 447 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46397609) | Link: https://exe.dev/

- TL;DR  
    - Exe.dev is a service where `ssh exe.dev` drops you into an isolated Linux environment with sudo and persistent disk, plus an optional AI “Extractor” helper, meant for instant experiments, projects, or teaching without managing infrastructure. Commenters like the frictionless, CLI-first workflow and ability to spin up many disposable “VMs” that share an account-level resource pool. Others criticize the cryptic landing page, confusing pricing table, and marketing containers as VMs. There’s debate over charging for SSO and praise for passkey-based auth and built‑in AI chat tooling.

- Comment pulse  
    - Landing page is too cryptic → visitors can’t tell it’s a shell/VM service; docs and pricing are buried, so many assume it’s an art project.  
    - Disposable persistent envs are appealing → fast to start, isolated, sharable; per‑account resources simplify spinning many VMs—counterpoint: unclear resource limits and container‑vs‑VM semantics worry some.  
    - Auth model splits opinions → some dislike SSO as paid extra; founder argues passkeys suit individuals, SSO belongs to teams; built‑in chat UI impresses non‑coders.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: A CLI-first “VMs on demand” model fits developers who hate cloud consoles but want persistent, shareable sandboxes.  
    - Impact: Could displace single VPSs and ad‑hoc home servers for side projects, workshops, and AI demos if pricing clarity improves.  
    - Watch next: Watch for clearer CPU/RAM quotas, easier public access (tunnels, domains), and how tightly AI agents integrate into everyday dev workflows.
