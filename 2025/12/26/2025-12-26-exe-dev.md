# Exe.dev

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46397609) | Link: https://exe.dev/

### TL;DR
Exe.dev is a developer-focused service for spinning up nearly bare‑metal VMs that feel disposable yet stay persistent, with minimal setup to put them on the public internet. Users praise the “Login with exe” flow, instant boot into a chat interface, and built‑in tooling like screenshots and LLM-style assistance, making it attractive even for non‑coders. Discussion centers on the strong developer experience versus more traditional VPS pricing, and clarification that CPU/RAM are shared per account across multiple VMs.

### Comment pulse
- Instant environments → “Login with exe,” one‑click VMs, and chat-at-boot make experiments frictionless and fun—counterpoint: other cloud tools exist but feel heavier and slower.
- Semi-throwaway VMs → Isolated, disposable yet persistent machines avoid cluttering main laptops/servers while still being public and shareable on the internet.
- Pricing model → Plan’s 2CPU/8GB are shared across up to 25 VMs; hardware isn’t the bargain, the value is DX and “CLI cred.”

---

### LLM perspective
- View → Exe.dev merges classic VPS with modern dev UX: auth, chat, screenshots, and zero-config public exposure.
- Impact → Lowers the bar for prototypes, teaching, and LLM experimentation for people without reliable local setups.
- Watch next → Clearer pricing tiers, performance benchmarks vs VPS, and APIs/CLIs for integrating ephemeral VMs into workflows.
