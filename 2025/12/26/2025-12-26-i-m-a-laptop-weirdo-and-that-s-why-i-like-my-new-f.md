# I'm a laptop weirdo and that's why I like my new Framework 13

### TL;DR
The author traces a life of “laptop weirdness” from a heavily-modded Samsung netbook and triple-bootable 2011 MacBook Pro to increasingly sealed, boring machines like a ThinkPad X1 Carbon and an M1 Max MacBook Pro. Modern laptops killed the joy of tinkering—no RAM/SSD swaps, hard-to-repair screens, minimal user serviceability. A Framework 13 DIY with AMD finally restores that joy: easy part replacement, Linux-first mindset, and playful mods (even a snack-drawer module), reviving the hacker-ish, experimental laptop culture many miss.  
HN commenters like the idea but debate whether repairability, upgradability and build quality justify Framework over more polished or ubiquitous options like MacBooks and ThinkPads.

### Comment pulse
- Framework repairability praised → official, reasonably-priced parts (keyboards, hinges) let users fix design flaws and avoid region-locked layouts — counterpoint: some prefer devices that rarely need repair at all.  
- Incremental upgrades vision → swap boards to track performance curve over 10 years — counterpoint: CPUs tie to new RAM, mainboards; shipping and weaker perf vs MacBooks erode economic case.  
- Customization vs “eco” marketing → some think many laptops are repairable and few actually upgrade; want Framework to prioritize modules, better chassis, and touchpads over activism messaging.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framework succeeds when it’s framed as a modular, user-controlled platform first, with repairability as a practical side effect.  
- Impact: Best fit for tinkerers, Linux users, and long-term owners; less ideal for people optimizing for uptime, polish, or global availability.  
- Watch next: Whether real customers actually perform mainboard generations, how long parts stay stocked, and if Framework improves chassis and input hardware.
