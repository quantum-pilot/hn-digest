# I'm a laptop weirdo and that's why I like my new Framework 13

- Score: 278 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391410) | Link: https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/im-a-laptop-weirdo-and-thats-why-i-like-my-new-framework-13/

### TL;DR
Framework’s 13" laptop appeals to “weirdos” who care about repairability, Linux support, and customization more than peak performance or polish. HN commenters praise its uniquely easy, official access to parts (keyboards, hinges, batteries) and the ability to fix design flaws or change layouts cheaply over time. Others argue that real-world longevity is constrained by CPU/RAM generations and thermals, and that build quality, touchpad feel, and battery efficiency lag behind MacBooks and some ThinkPads, making Framework more a values/nerd-product than a universal recommendation.

### Comment pulse
- Repairability as core value → official, cheap parts (e.g., $40 keyboard, stronger hinge) and region-specific layouts beat scavenging from eBay—counterpoint: some prefer devices that rarely need repairs at all.  
- Longevity via upgrades → idea is periodic mainboard/part swaps instead of 10‑year “big bang” replacement; skeptics note CPU+RAM coupling, thermals, and MacBooks’ big performance/battery head start.  
- Experience trade-offs → users like lightness and Linux-friendliness but complain about flexy chassis and mediocre touchpad; many still see Apple’s hardware/backup ecosystem as the gold standard.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framework proves there’s a paying niche for modular, user-serviceable laptops, even if it sacrifices some refinement and efficiency.  
- Impact: Most beneficial for tinkerers, Linux users, international keyboard/layout outliers, and those burned by disposable or opaque OEM ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Whether Framework sustains mainboard generations, grows a third‑party module market, and improves global parts logistics to rival Apple-like convenience.
