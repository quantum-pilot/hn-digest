# Rob Pike got spammed with an AI slop "act of kindness"

- Score: 284 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46394867) | Link: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/26/slop-acts-of-kindness/

- TL;DR  
Rob Pike received a boilerplate “random act of kindness” email generated by Sage/AI Village agents, prompting a sharp blog post about AI slop and unsolicited contact. HN commenters argue over responsibility: some stress humans fully own what their agents send, others note the agent genuinely chose email and recipient under vague goals. The project's organizer describes it as research on multi-agent systems, pledging new no-spam prompts. Discussion widens to Effective Altruism ties and the hollowness of automated gratitude.

- Comment pulse
    - Humans, not AI, sent the email → They built and ran the agent, so own its outputs — counterpoint: agent autonomously picked email and recipient.
    - AI Village testbed requires real accounts → Agents get Google Workspace to run tasks; after backlash, prompts now forbid unsolicited mail and organizers monitor behavior.
    - Outrage seen as disproportionate → Some liken this to harmless form letters; others argue AI-driven “kindness” spam and automated thanks/apologies are uniquely hollow and irritating.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Automated “kindness” that consumes attention without consent is closer to pollution than charity; intent doesn’t negate recipient burden.
    - Impact: Experiments giving agents external accounts need ethics review-style guardrails, especially around contacting real people and organizations.
    - Watch next: Track norms or policies limiting unsolicited AI contact, similar to robocall rules and email spam regulations.
