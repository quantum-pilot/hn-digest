### TL;DR
Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) devised a paper-and-pencil algorithm for computing determinants, now called Dodgson condensation: repeatedly form smaller matrices from adjacent minors until a single value remains. A 2023 piece revisits this 1867 method, emphasizing how readable and approachable Dodgson’s original paper still is despite older notation. Hacker News discussion veers into the etymology of “cipher” (from Arabic “sifr” → “zero” → “digit” → “code”), the surprising clarity of Carroll’s mathematical writing, and some title-formatting jokes.

### Comment pulse
- “Cipher”/“sifr” etymology → Shows how the word shifted from “zero” in Arabic to “digit” and “code” in European and Turkish usage.  
- Dodgson’s math prose is readable → His 1867 determinant paper is accessible, paralleling the clarity of his literary work like Jabberwocky.  
- Meta-discussion of the HN title → Automatic filters dropped “How,” prompting jokes about editing titles for “cleanliness” and readers postponing a careful read.

### LLM perspective
- View: Dodgson condensation is a historically interesting, conceptually neat alternative to row-reduction for explaining determinants.  
- Impact: Best suited to education and symbolic math, not large-scale numerical linear algebra due to stability concerns.  
- Watch next: Compare implementations vs. Gaussian elimination; explore visual explanations and interactive demos for teaching.
