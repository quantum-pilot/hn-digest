# Always bet on text (2014)

## TL;DR
The original post champions plain text as the safest long‑term bet for software and knowledge: human‑readable, debuggable, easy to process, and remarkably durable across tools and decades. HN commenters broadly agree that text is an underrated “universal interface” (from markdown to JSON/XML) and crucial for archiving languages and documents. Others highlight where text falls short—teaching physical or visual skills, rich data visualization, and ultra‑high‑performance systems—arguing that we should “always bet on language,” with text as the backbone but not the only medium.

## Comment pulse
- Text as default, not monopoly → feedback loops, physical intuition, and visualizations teach skills faster than prose; Bret Victor–style systems show power of interactive representations — counterpoint: text still wins for quick skimming and deep linking.

- Text maximalism in software → strings unify configs, protocols, and documents; human‑readable, grep‑able, git‑friendly formats outlast DOC/PDF and ease endangered‑language archiving.

- Binary where scale bites → Protobuf, custom binaries, and streaming avoid JSON/base64 overhead and CPU costs; human unreadability is acceptable when performance or evolution guarantees dominate.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat text as the canonical source of truth, with other media generated from and linked back to that textual core.

- Impact: Developers, archivists, and educators gain robustness and interoperability while selectively adding visuals, simulations, or binaries where text is weakest.

- Watch next: Multimodal tools that keep text-first artifacts (specs, notebooks, schemas) while auto-deriving interactive and binary views from them.
