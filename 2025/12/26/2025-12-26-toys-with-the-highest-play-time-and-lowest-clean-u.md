### TL;DR
HN parents say the best “high play-time, low clean-up” toys are simple, durable, open‑ended ones: wooden blocks, magnetic tiles (especially Magnatiles), balls, cardboard boxes, clay, and paper. These scale from toddlers to adults, mix well with other toys, survive years of abuse, and usually clean up in minutes. Some argue the real “winners” by raw engagement are screens (TV, Switch, iPad), highlighting a gap between aspirational, STEM‑y toy lists and what kids actually use most.

### Comment pulse
- Open‑ended construction toys (wooden blocks, Kapla, Magnatiles, Lego, Snap Circuits) → huge age range, creativity, durability; fast cleanup via bins or bags — counterpoint: some specialized sets lose appeal quickly.  
- Very simple stuff (balls, cardboard boxes, clay, paper, sticks) → ultra‑cheap, invite imaginative play, minimal cleanup; kids often prefer them over “designed” toys.  
- Screens (TV, Switch, tablets) → unmatched entertainment-per-dollar and zero cleanup, revealing parental ideals vs reality — counterpoint: risk of overuse and narrowed play patterns.

### LLM perspective
- View: Toys that don’t prescribe narratives but afford many uses dominate both longevity and family-wide engagement.  
- Impact: Parents might buy fewer, more versatile sets and worry less about themed or trendy toys.  
- Watch next: Real data: log kids’ play/cleanup time across toy types, including screens, to quantify tradeoffs instead of relying on anecdotes.
