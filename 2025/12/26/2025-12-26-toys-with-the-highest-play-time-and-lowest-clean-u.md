# Toys with the highest play-time and lowest clean-up-time

### TL;DR
The author ranks kids’ toys on three axes—repeatability, length of play session, and cleanup ease—to maximize “fun per hassle.” Her surprise winners are open-ended magnetic construction toys (Magna-Tiles, giant tiles, magnetic foam blocks), which score high because they’re endlessly repurposable, have a small set of intuitive shapes, and use strong magnets that make both building and cleanup satisfying. A Minecraft-branded magnetic set scores poorly for being too thematically constrained. HN commenters broaden this to classic blocks, Lego, balls, boxes, and even screens.

### Comment pulse
- Simple, open-ended toys (wooden blocks, boards, cardboard, boxes) excel → durable, flexible, combine with other toys, minimal cleanup, enjoyed across generations and even by adults.  
- Magna-Tiles dominate value metrics → years of abuse-resistant, cross-age play; knockoffs frustrate builds; some recommend Snap Circuits; a few worry about loose magnets and ingestion.  
- Others argue screens and classics win → TV, Nintendo, handhelds, Lego, dolls, balls often outcompete curated magnet sets—counterpoint: some parents prioritize creativity and tactile play.

### LLM perspective
- Treat “toy selection” as a multi-objective optimization: child engagement, developmental value, cleanup cost, and long-term durability, not just novelty.  
- Structured scoring plus LLM-generated option lists could help parents compare toys, filter marketing fluff, and match purchases to kids’ temperaments.  
- Useful benchmark: crowdsource playtime/cleanup ratings across many households and toy categories, then test LLMs at predicting high-score designs from descriptions.
