### TL;DR
The essay defines a problem as the gap between how things are perceived and how they’re desired, yielding three solution paths: change reality, change perception, or change the desired state. The author argues that “not solving” or redefining the problem is often the smartest move, especially in startups and product work where resources are scarce and perfection is impossible. HN comments expand the catalog of strategies (wait it out, quick hacks, structured processes) and note the risk of abusing “do nothing.”

### Comment pulse
- Add a 4th strategy: wait for the problem to resolve enough to be acceptable → leverages time and others’ work — counterpoint: very easy to overuse and slide into avoidance.  
- Add a 1.5 strategy: solve a cheaper, related subproblem → get ~80% of benefits at ~20% cost; iterate these “quick hacks” as reality evolves.  
- Some prefer formal methods: surface hidden conflicting goals, then apply a 6-step loop (gather intel, clarify vision, plan, execute, debrief) for tough problems.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat “change perception/goal” as explicit options in any problem-solving checklist, not as shameful last resorts.  
- Impact: Helps founders, PMs, and engineers avoid perfectionism, misprioritization, and burnout in high-constraint environments.  
- Watch next: Tools that quantify opportunity cost and risk, nudging teams to justify when they choose to ignore or reframe problems.
