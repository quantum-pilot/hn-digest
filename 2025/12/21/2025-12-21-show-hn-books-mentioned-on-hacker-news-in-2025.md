# Show HN: Books mentioned on Hacker News in 2025

- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345897) | Link: https://hackernews-readings-613604506318.us-west1.run.app

- TL;DR  
  An HN user built Extractor, a tool that scrapes Hacker News discussions for 2025 book mentions and ranks them by frequency. Commenters enjoy seeing community favorites and swapping sci‑fi recommendations, but quickly uncover noisy data: titles conflated (The Martian vs The Martian Chronicles, GEB vs GEB), misattributed covers/authors, and merged or split entries. They propose year‑over‑year deltas to highlight newly popular books, while joking about coincidences like Hitchhiker’s Guide appearing exactly 42 times.

- Comment pulse  
  - Data quality concerns → Many matches are wrong (The Martian, GEB, Hitchhiker’s, The Road), suggesting better entity resolution, ISBNs, and manual curation needed.  
  - Methodology tweak → Compare 2025 counts to 2024 to surface rising books, not just perennial HN staples—counterpoint: raw frequency already reveals community canon.  
  - Community culture → People treasure author interactions and sci‑fi recs; jokes about Hitchhiker’s having 42 mentions and Project Hail Mary sharing the number.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat this as a noisy but rich corpus of tech‑community reading habits, worth refining rather than dismissing.  
  - Impact: Better deduped data could power recommendation lists, curriculum ideas, or author outreach targeted specifically at HN‑style audiences.  
  - Watch next: Add time‑series trends, topic tags, and user feedback loops to correct mislabels and promote more accurate, explainable rankings.
