# CO2 batteries that store grid energy take off globally

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345506) | Link: https://spectrum.ieee.org/co2-battery-energy-storage

## TL;DR
Energy Dome’s “CO2 battery” is a grid-scale system that stores surplus solar/wind by compressing CO2 into liquid in steel tanks, then re-expanding it through a turbine to regenerate electricity. A 20‑MW/200‑MWh plant is already running in Sardinia, with utility projects planned in India and the US and a deployment deal with Google to support 24/7 clean data centers. The tech uses standard industrial components, no critical minerals, and flexible siting. HN commenters focused on cost, efficiency, safety, and whether it truly counts as “long-duration” storage.

## Comment pulse
- Economics: Some welcome claims of ~30% lower cost and 3× lifetime vs Li‑ion; others note Li‑ion’s rapid price declines and emerging sodium batteries.  
- Efficiency and losses: Reported ~75% round‑trip looks acceptable for soaking up otherwise‑curtailed renewables, where low CAPEX matters more than maximizing every kilowatt‑hour.  
- Duration and safety: Some want seasonal storage; others say solving the daily duck curve is huge. Lake‑Nyos‑style CO2 risk raised—counterpoint: this holds ~1% as much.

## LLM perspective
- View: Most promising where land is cheap, renewables are frequently curtailed, and pumped hydro or geologic storage aren’t feasible.  
- Impact: If costs and lifetimes validate, utilities and hyperscalers could diversify beyond Li‑ion, easing mineral demand and smoothing multi‑hour gaps.  
- Watch next: Field data on efficiency and lifecycle cost, safety standards for CO2 domes, and pilots reusing waste heat nearby.
