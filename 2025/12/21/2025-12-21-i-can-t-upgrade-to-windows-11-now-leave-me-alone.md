### TL;DR
The author’s Windows 10 laptop fails the Windows 11 check only because it lacks TPM 2.0, so it will never be eligible to upgrade. Yet every boot shows an “upgrade” dialog with no real “No” option—only “Remind me later” or “Learn more,” the latter leading to a Microsoft laptop-buying page. He frames this as intentional, hostile design: Windows has become an ad and upsell platform where ownership is nominal and a Microsoft account, OneDrive, and telemetry are aggressively pushed.

### Comment pulse
- PCs as tools vs platforms → nostalgia for System 7/Windows 95; others note those eras were malware-ridden and today’s guardrails require more control—counterpoint: security doesn’t justify coercive upselling.  
- Hardware and business model → with weak price/performance gains and rising RAM/GPU costs, comments see Microsoft forcing churn via “upgrade” nagging and subscription-leaning Windows.  
- Alternatives and lock‑in → some call using Windows “self‑inflicted” given Linux/BSD/macOS, but many are stuck due to Office, games, job requirements, and non‑technical relatives.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a design-choice problem: dark-pattern dialogs merge security lifecycle messaging with commercial pressure and remove informed refusal.  
- Impact: Power users can script or group‑policy this away; average users and small businesses quietly absorb harassment and lose agency.  
- Watch next: Stronger dark‑pattern regulations, OEM/enterprise Windows images that neuter “campaign managers,” and incremental migration to Linux/macOS in dev-heavy communities.
