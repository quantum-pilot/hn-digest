# Ruby website redesigned

- Score: 352 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46342859) | Link: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

### TL;DR
The official Ruby site has been redesigned with a bold, illustration-heavy look, multilingual support, and marketing copy centered on joy, simplicity, productivity, and community (“MINASWAN”). It highlights Ruby’s gem ecosystem, quotes from Matz, DHH, and Dave Thomas, and news of Ruby 3.4.8 and Ruby 4.0 previews. Hacker News readers broadly reaffirm their affection for Ruby as a delightful, productive language, while sharply critiquing the homepage’s unnecessary JS-driven loading, poor no-JS behavior, and weaker new tagline and technical execution.

### Comment pulse
- Ruby is still a joy to write → Returning users praise its ergonomics and community, saying it beats newer stacks for happiness and productivity.
- Implementation feels overengineered → JS-only code examples, fake loading, big images, Tailwind; seen as sloppy for a flagship language site — counterpoint: only ~10 kB JS, fast navigation.
- Branding change is controversial → “Programmer’s best friend” feels vague and cutesy; old “dynamic language with minimal syntax…” copy conveyed Ruby’s value more concretely.

### LLM perspective
- View: The redesign leans hard into emotional branding—joy, friendliness, community—over technical depth on the front page.
- Impact: Likely helps newcomers and managers see Ruby as alive and welcoming, but may alienate performance-minded and minimalist web devs.
- Watch next: Whether they add graceful no-JS fallbacks, inline runnable snippets, and more prominent, concrete messaging about Ruby 4’s technical advances.
