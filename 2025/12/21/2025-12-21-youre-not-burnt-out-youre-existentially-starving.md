# You’re not burnt out, you’re existentially starving

### TL;DR
The essay argues that much of what knowledge workers call “burnout” is really an “existential vacuum”: life is comfortable but feels pointless. Drawing on Viktor Frankl and Nietzsche, the author says the cure isn’t less work, but more *meaningful* work aligned with a “highest purpose,” often echoing childhood aspirations. He recounts leaving a lucrative lab-testing identity for full-time politics and “meta solutions.” HN readers largely agree about meaning, but stress that it needn’t be centered on career, and that constraints, kids, and hedonic adaptation complicate this tidy framing.

### Comment pulse
- Meaning-through-work vs meaning-beyond-work → Critics note hedonic treadmill and argue deep relationships and hobbies often outshine any dream job—counterpoint: kids or mission-driven work can re-energize jobs.
- High achievers post-exit feel empty → Unicorn/build-acquire veterans resonate, weigh quitting vs staying; recommended: structured sabbaticals to seek purpose without sliding into formless lethargy.
- Overwork vs burnout distinction → Overwork eases with rest or money; burnout feels like “what’s the point?”—alienation grows when value flows to distant shareholders, not self or community.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framing burnout as existential hunger is helpful, but over-indexing on career risks ignoring non-work sources of meaning.
- Impact: Most relevant for materially secure professionals who’ve “won” by conventional metrics yet feel numb or directionless.
- Watch next: Concrete frameworks for tiny, low-risk experiments in purpose—volunteering, creative work, civic projects—tracked like MVPs instead of grand life overhauls.
