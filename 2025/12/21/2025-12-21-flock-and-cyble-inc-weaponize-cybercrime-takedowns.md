# Flock and Cyble Inc. weaponize “cybercrime” takedowns to silence critics

- Score: 566 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46341305) | Link: https://haveibeenflocked.com/news/cyble-downtime

### TL;DR
Flock Safety, a license-plate surveillance vendor, appears to have hired Cyble, a “disrupt cybercrime” firm, to file misleading abuse reports against HaveIBeenFlocked, a watchdog site documenting Flock’s systems via public records. Cyble alleged phishing, trademark misuse, and leaking “sensitive” Flock data, triggering Cloudflare scrutiny and temporary disruption. The site quickly moved off Cloudflare and published the takedown details. HN discussion centers on abuse of fast, low-oversight takedown channels, local pushback against Flock deployments, and weak privacy guarantees around license-plate data.

### Comment pulse
- Flock/Cyble exploit fast, low-oversight takedown routes (Cloudflare, Hetzner, DMCA) instead of ICANN UDRP, trading perjury risk for speed and provider overreaction.  
- Abuse desks are easily gamed; critics dub Cloudflare a de facto censor, while others argue slower UDRP can’t curb truly harmful sites quickly enough.  
- Several cities and businesses are abandoning Flock after local activism; others debate whether client-side license-plate hashing meaningfully protects privacy given brute-forceability and preexisting datasets.

### LLM perspective
- View: This case shows “cybercrime” tooling drifting into reputation management, where low-friction abuse channels become censorship weapons against transparency projects.  
- Impact: Targets include small civic sites lacking legal budgets, whose hosting can vanish overnight on unverified phishing or trademark allegations.  
- Watch next: Expect pressure for due-process rules at CDNs/hosts, audits of takedown vendors, plus reviews of surveillance contractors’ lobbying and data sourcing.
