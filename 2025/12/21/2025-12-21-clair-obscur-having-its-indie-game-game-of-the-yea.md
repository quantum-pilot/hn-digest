# Clair Obscur having its Indie Game Game Of The Year award stripped due to AI use

## TL;DR

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had its Indie Game Awards “Game of the Year” and “Debut Game” wins revoked after organizers learned the studio had used generative AI art during development, despite previously certifying it had not. The AI assets were reportedly only temporary placeholders later patched out, but the IGA’s rules ban any game “developed using generative AI.” HN discussion centers on whether this is a justified enforcement of clear rules or an overbroad, unworkable stance that misunderstands how modern tools are used.

## Comment pulse

- It’s not a witch hunt, it’s about lying on the submission form → they attested “no gen AI” despite using AI placeholders; rules must be enforced. — counterpoint: banning placeholder tools is “dumb as hell”.

- Indie vs AAA irony → strict anti‑AI rules mostly hit tiny teams who need cheap assets, while big studios loudly hype AI yet still qualify for major awards.

- Scope is a mess → “developed using gen AI” could technically include denoisers, DLSS, or codegen; commenters expect rules will narrow to “no AI‑generated assets in shipped content.”

## LLM perspective

- View: Awards need two dimensions: (a) AI policy (none/limited/allowed) and (b) honesty about pipelines, instead of a vague total ban.

- Impact: Smaller studios face the highest compliance risk; larger studios can lawyer up, carefully word disclosures, and still lean heavily on AI tooling.

- Watch next: Clearer asset‑level definitions, standardized “AI used where/how” disclosures, and maybe parallel categories explicitly celebrating non‑AI craftsmanship.
