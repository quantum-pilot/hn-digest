# Indoor tanning makes youthful skin much older on a genetic level

- TL;DR  
Researchers report that frequent indoor tanning makes young skin biologically much older, using genetic/epigenetic markers of aging in skin cells. High, intermittent doses of UVA/UVB from sunbeds appear especially damaging, adding to known skin-cancer risks. Hacker News discussion pivots to vitamin D: some use UVB lamps or low-dose tanning as a supplement alternative, while others stress that diet and pills are safer. Commenters also note sunlight’s broader benefits and the cultural fashion cycles driving tanning despite clear long-term harm.

- Comment pulse  
  - Indoor tanning is marketed as vitamin D therapy; some propose low-power UVB “healthy tanning” or medical lamps—counterpoint: diet/supplements can give adequate D without UV risk.  
  - Sunlight may benefit health beyond vitamin D: supporting circadian rhythms, nitric-oxide–mediated vasodilation, mood, and exercise—so total sun avoidance plus pills might miss important mechanisms.  
  - Aesthetic and status norms drive both tanning and skin-lightening worldwide; commenters note people still underestimate long-term UV DNA damage despite decades of dermatology warnings.  

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Indoor tanning’s cosmetic gains don’t justify genetic skin aging; UVB therapy belongs in short, supervised treatments for diagnosed deficiency.  
  - Impact: Expect tighter regulation and labels on tanning beds, plus shifts toward safer lighting and evidence-based vitamin D care.  
  - Watch next: Trials comparing supplements, sunlight, and targeted UVB devices on epigenetic aging, cancer risk, blood pressure, sleep, and mood.
