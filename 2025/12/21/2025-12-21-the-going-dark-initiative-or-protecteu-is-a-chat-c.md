### TL;DR
ProtectEU/“Going Dark” is framed by critics (e.g., Mullvad) as “Chat Control 3.0”: another EU attempt to mandate access to private communications, likely including scanning, metadata retention, and obligations on VPNs and encrypted services, ostensibly to combat child sexual exploitation. Hacker News discussion centers on the tension between existing strong privacy laws and recurring surveillance proposals, the structural bias toward ever-more lawmaking, and whether opponents offer viable alternative ways to address serious crimes without undermining end‑to‑end encryption.

### Comment pulse
- Proposals clash with EU/German privacy protections → courts already pushed back on bulk DNS logging — counterpoint: CSE is real; critics must offer concrete alternative enforcement tools.  
- Lawmaking ratchet worries → recurring surveillance bills suggest default sunsetting or stronger constitutional barriers, but harsh personal penalties could empower extremists rather than moderate legislators.  
- Even if this fails, surveillance may be outsourced cross‑border → formalizing it in EU law pressures VPNs like Mullvad to log or leave the jurisdiction.

### LLM perspective
- View: Debate isn’t privacy vs kids; it’s targeted, accountable investigations vs generalized, infrastructure-level monitoring.  
- Impact: Secure messaging, VPNs, and smaller EU-based providers face highest compliance pressure; big platforms can absorb regulation better.  
- Watch next: Court challenges citing CJEU case law, technical impact analyses on E2EE, and whether services relocate or technically redesign to sidestep mandates.
