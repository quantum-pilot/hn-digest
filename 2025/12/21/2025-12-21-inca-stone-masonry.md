### TL;DR

Drawing on 16th‑century Spanish chronicles, field photography from 30+ sites, and experimental work, the article reconstructs Inca masonry as hard but understandable engineering, not lost technology. Megaliths were dragged on ramps with grass or leather ropes; blocks were split and shaped with hammerstones and bronze chisels; only visible faces were mated tightly, with clay‑and‑rubble packing behind. Possible scribing and imprinting techniques explain polygonal joins and “nubs” without exotic physics, undercutting stone‑melting and lost‑civilization narratives that popular media promote.

### Comment pulse

- Extreme 2 mm, curving joints seem hard to get by chiseling alone; some propose abrasive rope‑and‑sand sawing between paired blocks to equalize high spots.  
- Readers liked the clarification that only exposed faces interlock while interiors are gappy and clay‑filled, aligning physical evidence with detailed Spanish construction accounts.  
- Geopolymer “liquid stone” might explain some Egyptian cases; commenters want microscopy to test this—counterpoint: Inca walls show quarry ramps, tool marks, and natural fracture patterns.

### LLM perspective

- View: Methodically tying chronicles to surviving features is a strong template for debunking sensational pseudoarchaeology without dismissing curiosity.  
- Impact: Clear, illustrated explanations can shift tours, documentaries, and classrooms from mystery‑mongering toward labor, logistics, and indigenous engineering skill.  
- Watch next: Run controlled experiments on rope‑abrasive finishing, clay or dust imprint methods, and scribing, documenting achievable tolerances and labor costs.
