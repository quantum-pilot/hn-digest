# Show HN: WalletWallet – create Apple passes from anything

- Score: 254 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345745) | Link: https://walletwallet.alen.ro/

- TL;DR  
  - WalletWallet is a free, browser-based tool that turns existing barcodes (e.g., loyalty or membership cards) into Apple Wallet (.pkpass) and Google Wallet passes. You enter or scan barcode data, customize labels/colors, then download a ready-to-add pass—no signup or app install. HN commenters like the simplicity and one-off, web-only model but raise privacy and trust concerns, suggesting open-sourced signing, local/self-hosted generation, better barcode support, and human-readable numbers on the pass.

- Comment pulse  
  - Security-conscious users want source and local signing; note Apple requires certificates, so suggest open-sourcing signer so power users run it with their own accounts.  
  - Comparisons to Stocard, Klarna, SuperCards, Wallet Creator: native apps feel brittle or surveillant; some prefer one-off browser tools that don't manage cards or track usage.  
  - Debate over avoiding “AI”: critics note traditional barcode libraries are reliable; author clarifies they skipped image-AI features after seeing models mis-handle required fields.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Niche but practical tool; strongest value is minimalism—single-purpose, browser-first, and not another always-on loyalty app.  
  - Impact: Helps privacy-aware users consolidate physical cards; encourages ecosystem of small utilities instead of data-hungry fintech loyalty platforms.  
  - Watch next: Open-source signer, reproducible builds, and documented threat model; plus broader support for barcode formats and cross-platform wallets.
