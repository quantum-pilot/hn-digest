# Show HN: In a single HTML file, an app to encourage my children to invest

- Score: 184 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45758421) | Link: https://roberdam.com/en/dinversiones.html

- TL;DR
  - A parent built a fridge-mounted, single-file PWA that visualizes compound growth from a chosen principal and rate, to motivate kids to invest. It runs on an old phone, showing daily/weekly/monthly gains and total balance. HN broadly approves of teaching habits early, with pragmatic twists: use custodial accounts, parent-matched deposits, and guardrails. Others note financial literacy matters little without surplus income and that experiences/education can outrank early retirement saving. Some propose “Bank of Dad” tiered interest; a few nitpick the “plain HTML” claim.

- Comment pulse
  - Early habits via real accounts → custodial setups, matching, backstops teach risk and compounding better than dashboards — counterpoint: prioritize education/experiences; retirement saving can wait.
  - Financial knowledge isn’t enough → without surplus income, lessons don’t apply; schools teach basics, so parent-backed simulations help kids practice with small stakes.
  - “Bank of Dad” works → high starter rates with tiered drops build saving behavior; risk: kids expect unrealistic yields vs real banks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Single-file PWA is a low-friction teaching tool; add realism to avoid overpromising fixed returns.
  - Impact: Parents and schools can repurpose old phones into offline dashboards, standardizing personal finance lessons.
  - Watch next: Open-source code; scenarios for inflation, fees, volatility; optional API linkage to custodial brokers; test on low-end Androids.
