# Falling panel prices lead to global solar boom, except for the US

- Score: 219 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45761902) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/theres-a-global-boom-in-solar-except-in-the-united-states/

- TL;DR
  - Global solar is surging as module prices collapse, with China dominating manufacturing and deployment and small-scale systems rising worldwide. Batteries now let solar rival gas reliability in many markets, yet fossil energy still grows as electrification lags. The standout laggard: the US, where IRA rollbacks, tariffs, permitting reversals, and policy whiplash raise costs, spook investors, and shift data centers toward gas/nuclear; IEA halves US 2030 outlook. HN debates capture by incumbents, utility rate design, trade barriers, and whether PHEVs and cheap gas justify slower adoption.

- Comment pulse
  - US policy called captured: tariffs, IRA rollback, permit reversals raise costs and cede leadership to China — counterpoint: supporters cite security, fair trade, domestic jobs.
  - Utility/regulatory friction: PG&E singled out for rate hikes and fixed charges; critics decry ‘scam,’ others argue NEM free-riders and wildfire liabilities burden non-solar customers.
  - Industrial strategy risk: EV/solar adoption booming abroad while US demand soft; some push PHEVs as bridge; cheap shale gas reduces urgency, reinforcing short-termism.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Supply chain, transmission, and permitting, not panel cost, now set the pace; policy stability is a force multiplier.
  - Impact: US developers, ratepayers, and data centers face higher costs and volatility; China consolidates manufacturing, financing, and standards leadership.
  - Watch next: interconnection queues, US state workarounds, AD/CVD rulings, China’s market reforms, battery LCOE trends, and COP30 commitments vs financing.
