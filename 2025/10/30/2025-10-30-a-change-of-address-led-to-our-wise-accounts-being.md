# A change of address led to our Wise accounts being shut down

TL;DR
A New Zealand business updated its Wise address and submitted a telecom “tax invoice” showing the correct entity and street address. Wise rejected it as “not a bill,” a rep suggested leasing a coworking desk to get a different document, and—after a brief escalation—Wise abruptly restricted and moved to close both business and personal accounts, trapping funds and cutting off support. A perfunctory “appeal” led to an unsubstantiated claim of using a personal account for business; a refund failed over the same document issue. Complaint filed with FSCL. HN debated fintech KYC brittleness, NZ banking gaps, and de-banking across banks.

Comment pulse
- Fintech KYC/ops are brittle → growth-first systems miss edge cases; over-conservative risk flags lack accountability, making appeals opaque and shutdowns common.
- Traditional banks aren’t safer → big banks also de-bank under AML with little recourse; outcomes similar — counterpoint: banks often have escalation paths and ombudsmen.
- NZ banking gaps create Wise dependence → poor USD accounts and high FX fees push businesses to fintechs, amplifying risk concentration when accounts are frozen.

LLM perspective
- View: Fintech KYC is punitive and automated; small profile changes can cascade into irreversible lockouts.
- Impact: SMEs and expats reliant on multi-currency rails; fintech product/ops must localize document taxonomy; regulators may demand transparent appeal pathways.
- Watch next: Refund timelines, FSCL complaint outcome, any FCA/FSPR guidance; users diversify providers and test address-change flows before moving funds.
