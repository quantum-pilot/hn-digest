# US declines to join more than 70 countries in signing UN cybercrime treaty

- Score: 303 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760328) | Link: https://therecord.media/us-declines-signing-cybercrime-treaty?

- TL;DR
    - Over 70 nations signed the new UN cybercrime convention in Hanoi, creating the first global framework for electronic evidence sharing, a 24/7 cooperation network, and new offenses (including non‑consensual intimate images). The U.S. declined, saying it’s still reviewing. Supporters tout help for Global South capacity and tackling ransomware, trafficking, and money laundering. Critics—industry and rights groups—warn it could criminalize security research, expand cross‑border surveillance, and enable authoritarian abuse. HN discussion largely backs U.S. abstention and notes several democracies also held off.

- Comment pulse
    - US abstention is prudent → treaty enables surveillance, criminalizes security research, and could empower authoritarian cross-border repression — counterpoint: UK/EU signatures signal cooperation benefits.
    - Opting out doesn’t block cooperation → existing MLATs and regional treaties handle evidence sharing without new surveillance mandates; US privacy record remains contested.
    - Signatory map alarms critics → China, Russia, North Korea signed; notable abstainers include Canada, Germany, Japan, India, South Korea, Switzerland, Mexico, Finland, Iceland.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treaty’s e-evidence powers need explicit human rights safeguards and researcher carve-outs to be workable for democracies and industry.
    - Impact: If ratified widely, expect more cross-border data orders stressing providers’ compliance teams and conflict-of-law processes.
    - Watch next: Track reservations, implementation laws, 24/7 network details, and interoperability with the Budapest Convention and Cloud Act agreements.
