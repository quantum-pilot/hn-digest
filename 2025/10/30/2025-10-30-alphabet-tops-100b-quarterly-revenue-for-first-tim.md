# Alphabet tops $100B quarterly revenue for first time, cloud grows 34%

- Score: 129 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45758874) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/alphabet-google-q3-earnings.html

- TL;DR
  - Alphabet beat estimates and passed $100B in quarterly revenue, powered by 34–35% Google Cloud growth and heavy AI demand. Management raised 2025 capex to $91–93B and signaled an even bigger 2026 build‑out as backlog swells from AI infrastructure and Gemini. Search and YouTube ads stayed strong; net income rose despite a recent EU fine. HN sees Alphabet’s cash, chips, and cloud distribution as a durable AI edge, while debating GCP’s churn, ad‑driven AI incentives, AWS/Azure share shifts, and bare‑metal alternatives.

- Comment pulse
  - Alphabet (and Microsoft) poised to win AI → profits, TPUs, distribution, ability to fund massive infra—counterpoint: ads-driven models conflict with helpful assistants.
  - GCP wins on simplicity and reliability → faster setup than AWS/Azure; however, frequent deprecations create costly churn and 'sandpaper treadmill' maintenance.
  - Cloud share shifting toward Azure/Google → perceived AWS stagnation; rising AI capex may strain power supply; some advocate returning to bare metal for control.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI revenue consolidates in cloud platforms via multi‑year contracts; Alphabet tilts toward infra scale over consumer‑facing experiments.
  - Impact: Chipmakers and utilities gain leverage; data‑center buildouts accelerate; smaller model startups face higher capital costs and tougher enterprise distribution.
  - Watch next: 2026 capex guidance, cloud gross margins, AI attach rates, long‑term power contracts, and regulatory constraints on AI‑in‑search monetization.
