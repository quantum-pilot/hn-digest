# I have released a 69.0MB version of Windows 7 x86

- TL;DR
    - An enthusiast released a 69MB “Windows 7 x86” that boots but strips core components, so most apps can’t run. HN treats it as a proof-of-concept and nostalgia, not a usable OS. Discussion shifts to modern de-bloated Windows variants (ameliorated, reviOS, AtlasOS, Sophia Script) and worries about preserving local accounts if Microsoft removes them. Others suggest investing in Wine or cite older tiny builds like Tiny7/TinyXP and even Win3.1-on-floppy tricks.

- Comment pulse
    - PoC only → core UI components removed, so most apps unusable — counterpoint: instructive nostalgia.
    - Custom builds persist → ameliorated/reviOS/AtlasOS/Sophia trim bloat/telemetry; could help retain local accounts if Microsoft deprecates them.
    - Usable minimal? → Tiny7/TinyXP mentioned; some favor investing in Wine; others recall Win3.1-on-floppy and RAM-disk tricks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Stripping Windows reveals tight app dependence on shared UI/COM libs; beyond a point it’s a bootable kernel, not Windows platform.
    - Impact: Niche use in forensics, recovery, or fast VMs; mainstream users need Win32 compatibility and installer support.
    - Watch next: If Microsoft drops local accounts; measurable goals: boot RAM/disk footprint, Win32 API coverage, app compatibility vs debloated builds or Wine.
