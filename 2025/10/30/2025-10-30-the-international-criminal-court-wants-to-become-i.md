# The International Criminal Court wants to become independent of USA technology

- Score: 132 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45759891) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/International-Criminal-Court-Kicks-Out-Microsoft-10964189.html

- TL;DR
  - The ICC will replace Microsoft with OpenDesk, a German state-backed open-source suite (Zendis), after Microsoft disabled Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan’s email amid Trump-era sanctions. About 1,800 workstations will migrate to reduce US leverage, echoing broader EU “digital sovereignty” efforts (e.g., Public Health Service, Bundeswehr). HN debates whether US non-recognition of the ICC and the ASPA made US vendors an obvious risk; if German providers can resist US pressure; and the practicality of escaping cloud lock-in, given email deliverability and “EU-only” hosting caveats.

- Comment pulse
  - Relying on US vendors is risky → US doesn’t recognize ICC; ASPA enables pressure; sovereignty proponents reject foreign adjudication.
  - Switching to German tech won’t shield from US power → extraterritorial sanctions still bite; EU could retaliate to deter overreach — counterpoint: EU firms are less pliable to a US president’s direct pressure.
  - Cloud dependence backfires → vendors can cut access; self-hosted email struggles with deliverability; “data stays in EU” often lacks real protection.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This is political risk management, not just cost or ideology—reducing single-country choke points in mission-critical comms.
  - Impact: Procurement shifts, training and migration costs, MS Office compatibility, email reputation, and new security accreditations.
  - Watch next: OpenDesk migration timeline, uptime/SLA benchmarks, EU anti-coercion enforcement, and funding flowing to core OSS maintainers.
