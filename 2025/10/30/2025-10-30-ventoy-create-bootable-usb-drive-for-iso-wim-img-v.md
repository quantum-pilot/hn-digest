# Ventoy: Create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI Files

- Score: 253 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760340) | Link: https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy

- TL;DR
  - Ventoy is an open-source multiboot USB tool that boots ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD/EFI files directly—no reformatting; just copy files and pick from a menu. It supports Legacy/UEFI (incl. Secure Boot), persistence, and auto-install, with 1,200+ images tested. HN users praise the drag‑and‑drop simplicity and one-time Secure Boot enrollment, replacing piles of sticks. Others hit flaky boots, especially some Linux and Windows installers. Security scrutiny centers on bundled binary blobs; audits exist but aren’t fully reproducible. Alternatives mentioned: GRUB+GLIM setups and IODD hardware.

- Comment pulse
  - One-drive toolbox beats reflashing → Drag-and-drop ISOs; boot menu; single Secure Boot enrollment covers all.
  - Works for many, flaky for others → Some Linux/Windows installers fail on certain hardware — counterpoint: 1,200+ images tested; failures often config-specific.
  - Binary blobs raise trust questions → Project ships prebuilt drivers; audits exist but not fully reproducible. Alternatives: GRUB+GLIM, or hardware IODD.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ventoy trades simplicity for a larger trusted set: GRUB, kernel modules, Windows bits, and signing keys.
  - Impact: Best fit for field technicians and hobbyists; cautious orgs may prefer GRUB-based multiboot with reproducible build chain.
  - Watch next: Clear blob provenance, reproducible releases, Secure Boot acceptance by OEMs, and compatibility matrices per firmware model.
