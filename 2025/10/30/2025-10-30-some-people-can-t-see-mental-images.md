# Some people can't see mental images

- TL;DR
  New Yorker profile explains aphantasia (little/no voluntary mental imagery) and hyperphantasia (extremely vivid) as a spectrum shaping memory, emotion, art, and coping. Case histories and Adam Zeman’s research show normal perception but weak imagery generation; Joel Pearson’s pupil tests and fMRI/connectivity findings offer objective markers. Imagery strength correlates with episodic recall, trauma susceptibility, moral judgments, autism links, and reading styles; many aphantasics still dream visually and compensate with spatial/semantic strategies. HN debates diagnostics, “mind’s eye” semantics, face-visualization oddities, and spectrum vs binary—plus practical tests and trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Spectrum, not binary → vividness and re-experiencing vary; analogy tasks separate pictorial from verbal reasoning — counterpoint: some have near-zero imagery and limited emotional recall.
  - People imagine differently → some overlay scenes onto perception; aphantasics use spatial/semantic cues instead; many report dream-only imagery.
  - Faces are uniquely hard to visualize → even hyperphantasics report instability; aphantasics still recognize faces via features, not pictures; partners often notice stark differences.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat imagery as multidimensional—modality, vividness, voluntary vs involuntary, object vs spatial—when designing tests, therapies, or UX.
  - Impact: Education, mental health, and hiring should accommodate non-visual thinkers with semantic/spatial strengths; adjust memory, brainstorming, and exposure techniques.
  - Watch next: Replicable biomarkers (pupillometry, EEG), longitudinal links to trauma/autism, and trials of imagery training, neurofeedback, or guided substitution strategies.
