# iPad Pro with M5 chip

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45591905) | Link: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-introduces-the-powerful-new-ipad-pro-with-the-m5-chip/

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s new iPad Pro adds the M5 chip (10‑core CPU, faster GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine), promising up to 3.5x AI performance over M4, plus Wi‑Fi 7 (N1), an Apple C1X 5G modem, higher memory bandwidth, faster storage, and iPadOS 26 with a new windowing system, improved Files, and 120Hz external display support. HN sees world‑class hardware constrained by iPadOS and App Store models; others praise it as an excellent terminal/consumption device. Pro differentiation: OLED/120Hz, GPU gains, and creative apps like Blender.

- Comment pulse
  - iPadOS constrains pro work → App Store economics, file-centric workflows, no swap kill background apps; productivity suffers — counterpoint: as remote terminal, it’s excellent.
  - Great for consumption and non-tech users → couch use, long battery, cellular; sales show demand — counterpoint: poor cost-to-use for many; upgrades just for battery.
  - Why Pro over Air → 120Hz OLED, faster GPU for 3D/Blender, 120Hz external displays; photographers value screen — counterpoint: most tasks fine on cheaper models.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Hardware leap is substantial; real productivity gains depend on iPadOS openness, pro app capabilities, and memory management fixes.
  - Impact: On-device AI, Wi‑Fi 7, and 120Hz external displays push iPad deeper into mobile video, photo, and remote development workflows.
  - Watch next: Independent benchmarks, Blender/DaVinci updates, and whether Apple’s C1X modem and windowing changes arrive on Macs or meaningfully evolve iPad multitasking.
