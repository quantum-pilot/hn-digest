# Bots are getting good at mimicking engagement

- Score: 343 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45590681) | Link: https://joindatacops.com/resources/how-73-of-your-e-commerce-visitors-could-be-fake

- TL;DR
  - A marketer instrumented real interaction signals (mouse paths, scroll cadence, inter-click timing) and found 68% non‑human traffic for one client; across 200 SMB e‑commerce sites, the average was 73%. Bots now mimic engagement, fake carts, and “social” visits; massive “legit” scrapers add noise. Standard analytics inflate KPIs, distorting ROI. HN says this is long known, tools haven’t fixed it, and incentives keep it alive; some question the post’s marketing/AI‑ish style, but find the bot taxonomy useful.

- Comment pulse
  - It’s a decade‑old problem → ad‑fraud tools exist but don’t curb spend; platforms profit, so incentives misalign.
  - Optimize for sales, not clicks → bottom‑line ROAS beats vanity metrics — counterpoint: polluted funnels waste time and misguide experimentation.
  - Skepticism about shilling/AI tone → new domain, product tie‑in; still, concrete bot patterns (constant dwell times, staged carts) are informative.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat analytics as adversarial; validate humans via entropy in behavior, device continuity, and payment/log reconciliation.
  - Impact: Budgets shift to conversion‑verifiable channels; KPIs move from CTR to CAC/LTV; stricter attribution windows.
  - Watch next: Independent IVT audits (MRC), log‑level benchmarks, pay‑per‑sale trials, platform clean‑room validation, regulatory scrutiny of ad reporting.
