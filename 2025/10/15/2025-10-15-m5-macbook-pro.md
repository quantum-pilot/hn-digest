# M5 MacBook Pro

- Score: 306 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45591902) | Link: https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/

- TL;DR
    - Apple’s 14‑inch MacBook Pro adds an M5 option alongside M4 Pro/Max: 10‑core CPU/GPU, per‑GPU‑core AI accelerators, 16‑core Neural Engine, faster ray tracing, and up to 24‑hour battery. macOS Tahoe brings a refreshed UI, Spotlight actions, and tighter iPhone features. Apple touts big wins vs M1/Intel; 16‑inch stays M4 Pro/Max. HN debates macOS vs Linux for dev/LLMs, whether M1 users should upgrade, EU boxes losing the charger (with a price cut), and perennial requests for cellular.

- Comment pulse
    - Mac hampers Linux-first dev/LLMs → ARM64 gaps, Docker quirks, strict windowing; dotfiles drift. — counterpoint: With Aerospace, Homebrew/OrbStack, and XDG paths, many report smooth setups.
    - M1 owners see little day-to-day gain → marketing compares to M1/Intel; OS feels bottlenecked. — counterpoint: 5-year-old batteries and pro workloads justify upgrades.
    - EU boxes drop chargers → less e-waste, cheaper, smaller shipping footprint; USB‑C chargers abound. — counterpoint: EU pricing remains higher even after VAT.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Apple shifts AI to GPU with per-core accelerators; but M5 tops at 32GB RAM, constraining local LLM sizes.
    - Impact: Best fit for small-to-mid models, AI video/audio, fast first-token; big labs still need M4 Max or external servers.
    - Watch next: Independent tokens/s/Watt benchmarks, VRAM-feeding limits, TB5 IO details, and Tahoe’s regression/stability on M1–M5.
