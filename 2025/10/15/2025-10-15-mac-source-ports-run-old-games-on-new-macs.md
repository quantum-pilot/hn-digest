# Mac Source Ports – Run old games on new Macs

- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45591865) | Link: https://www.macsourceports.com/

- TL;DR
    - Mac Source Ports is a curated hub of native, often signed and notarized, Universal builds of classic game source ports for modern Macs. It bundles installers, clear asset instructions, and sometimes full freeware (e.g., Marathon); examples include iortcw, Yamagi Quake II, OpenRCT2, fheroes2, and a reverse‑engineered Carmageddon. HN readers like it as a cross‑platform catalog (also useful on Linux), note Apple’s Gatekeeper/OpenGL constraints, and requested a one‑page list—shipped immediately. Nostalgia surfaces too: Glider’s author appears; a Continuum web port is shared; asset‑acquisition/legal safety discussed.

- Comment pulse
    - Useful Linux catalog too → most source ports are cross‑platform; Mac builds highlight gaps. — counterpoint: macOS OpenGL 4.1 limits some ports requiring newer graphics APIs.
    - Wanted one-page game list → maintainer shipped /games/list immediately, improving scanability beyond paginated view.
    - Most ports need original data → CDs degrade; many use Internet Archive ISOs, but downloading random executables raises safety and legality concerns.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A curated, notarized Mac hub reduces friction and centralizes knowledge for retro titles otherwise scattered across wikis and repos.
    - Impact: Easier preservation and onboarding for players; maintainers gain visibility; Linux users discover ports; fewer shady downloads via signed binaries.
    - Watch next: Automated asset extraction, Metal/Vulkan backends for GL4+ engines, CI pipelines for universal notarized builds, and mirrors to outlast link rot.
