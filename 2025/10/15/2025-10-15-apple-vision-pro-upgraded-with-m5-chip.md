# Apple Vision Pro upgraded with M5 chip

- Score: 240 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45591801) | Link: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s refreshed Vision Pro swaps in the M5 (10‑core CPU/GPU, ray tracing), renders 10% more pixels, supports up to 120Hz, speeds on‑device AI, and bumps battery to 2.5–3 hours. A new Dual Knit Band targets comfort, visionOS 26 adds widgets, updated Personas, spatial photo depth, action‑cam 180/360 playback, and PlayStation VR2 controller support. Price remains $3,499. HN applauds the portable “giant monitor” use—especially on planes—but criticizes the lack of native macOS and multi‑window support, citing product segmentation; comfort and third‑party workarounds surface frequently.

- Comment pulse
  - Run macOS and multiple Mac windows → current app model feels hobbled, revenue-protective — counterpoint: OS-level window remoting is hard; tools like Ensemble/Blink partially help.
  - Big win is Mac Virtual Display → real productivity on flights and travel; spatial photos wow; but weight/comfort limit long sessions; new band interests owners.
  - Apple keeps Vision Pro separate from Macs → avoids cannibalization, simplifies testing; battery constraints cited; many just want a “My Virtual Mac” VM.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Specs matter less than software policy; native macOS or robust Mac window remoting would unlock clear pro workflows.
  - Impact: Traveling professionals and Apple‑ecosystem users benefit most; game devs gain ray tracing and PS VR2 support; enterprises expand training simulations.
  - Watch next: Independent benchmarks for 120Hz, battery, Neural Engine; uptake of third‑party multi‑window tools; movement toward native Mac VM or antitrust pressure.
