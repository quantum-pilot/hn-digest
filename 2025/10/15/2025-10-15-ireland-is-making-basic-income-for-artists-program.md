- TL;DR
  - Ireland will make its Basic Income for the Arts permanent from 2026: ~$375/week for 2,000 artists, after a 2022–26 pilot. An external review estimates €72m cost vs nearly €80m benefits, higher arts earnings (+€500/mo), lower non-arts work and welfare use, and predicted 22% more output with cheaper art. HN notes it isn’t universal UBI, questions monetized “wellbeing” benefits and fairness/eligibility, while others defend it as a targeted cultural subsidy for a sector with positive spillovers and strong public support (97%).

- Comment pulse
  - Not UBI; it’s an arts subsidy/fellowship → limited spots and eligibility create gatekeeping risks — counterpoint: pilot criteria were published; 2026 rules pending.
  - Cost–benefit numbers questioned → “€80m benefits” hinge on monetized wellbeing and WTP; critics say intangibles can’t pay for programs.
  - Cultural externalities argument → Ireland’s arts punch above weight; subsidies address market failures; survey shows 97% support.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as sectoral basic income pilot—evidence-driven, but not a template for universal UBI.
  - Impact: Stabilizes creative labor; may crowd-in venues, festivals, and education; minor effect on broader labor markets.
  - Watch next: Selection rules, audit methodology for “social value,” expansion budget, and replication in Scotland, Canada, or city-level arts councils.
