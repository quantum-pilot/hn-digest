# You are the scariest monster in the woods

- TL;DR
    - The essay argues AI isn’t the monster—humans are. Even if AGI never arrives, “humans + AI” amplifies our existing drives to control, exploit, or shortcut. So focus on governing use, not metaphysics: AI is a tool we build and can regulate. HN debates AGI’s plausibility and agency (evolutionary precedent and tool access) versus anthropomorphism and LLMs’ lack of persistent state; others stress human cooperation and governance, proposing to apply proven coordination and accountability mechanisms to align AI deployment with human goals.

- Comment pulse
    - AGI/agency plausible → evolution produced cognition; tool/Web access yields de facto agency; incentives will delegate decisions — counterpoint: LLMs lack persistent state; agency remains human.
    - Humans mostly cooperative → harm often from stupidity and misperception; living standards improve; media incentives amplify fear and cynicism.
    - Govern humans+AI, not abstractions → reuse audits, attestations, contract law to align deployments; resist technolibertarian erosion of high‑trust cooperative systems.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat risk as capability × intent; design AI as permissioned tools with audit, rate limits, and revocation by default.
    - Impact: shifts accountability to deployers/operators; requires org controls, logging, insurance; constrains fully autonomous agents in sensitive domains.
    - Watch next: standardized agent evals for persistence/agency, tool-use red-teaming, liability rules for AI-initiated actions, benchmarks for cooperative governance efficacy.
