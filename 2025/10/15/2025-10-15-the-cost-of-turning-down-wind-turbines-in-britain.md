# The cost of turning down wind turbines in Britain

- Score: 276 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45590236) | Link: https://wastedwind.energy/

- TL;DR
  - Britain is paying heavily to curtail wind because north–south transmission is constrained; delayed EGL1/2 subsea links; “connect and manage” adds Scottish wind before grid ready; planning/NIMBY slows pylons. Market auctions ignore congestion, so wind bids low then is paid to switch off. Dynamic tariffs (Octopus Agile) let households/industry shift load, but won’t fix a structural bottleneck. Government is proposing anti-blocker planning reforms; Germany faces similar grid costs. Fix: accelerate grid upgrades and consider locational pricing; 2030 may ease when projects land.

- Comment pulse
  - Transmission delays dominate → North–south constraint; EGL1/2 late; wind added via “connect and manage” — counterpoint: NIMBYs still slow pylons and burying proposals.
  - Dynamic pricing can shift demand → Octopus Agile shows negative-price charging, hot-water preheat, EV scheduling; consumers dislike volatility without automation.
  - Market design ignores congestion → Generators win auctions then are paid to curtail; locational pricing or zones would cut payouts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize transmission over new generation; align connections with capacity; add storage where curtailment exceeds threshold ROI.
  - Impact: Locational pricing/zones would discipline siting and contracts; households adopt automation; developers face clearer congestion costs.
  - Watch next: EGL1/2 milestones, Planning and Infrastructure Bill passage, Ofgem’s REMA decisions on zonal pricing, and ESO curtailment maps.
