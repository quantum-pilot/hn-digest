- TL;DR
    - The author argues we design and study programming languages not to re-express old ideas, but to explore new ones. A language is defined not only by syntax and semantics but also its ecosystem, and its value lies in the exploratory power it affords (libraries, types, concurrency). He urges building even impractical languages to unlock concepts. HN counters that usability is measurable via human-factors standards and history (e.g., Ada), while others note research-to-practice pipelines and that languages, paradigms, and community shape how we think and code.

- Comment pulse
    - Usability is measurable → HFE standards and methods exist; Ada considered them. — counterpoint: Popularity gaps suggest other factors dominate.
    - PL research informs practice → reading SIGPLAN shaped understanding of compilers/interpreters; features often prefigure production.
    - Exploration vs mere translation → new languages expose ideas and paradigms that change problem-solving; creation also persists because it's fun and possible.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat languages as exploration labs, but pair design with empirical usability testing to avoid reinventing harmful complexity.
    - Impact: Designers and educators emphasize ecosystems and paradigms; tooling teams prioritize ergonomics, diagnostics, and libraries as first-class language features.
    - Watch next: Run controlled studies comparing language ergonomics; track adoption of 'exploratory' languages; document research-to-industry transfers in compilers, types, and concurrency.
