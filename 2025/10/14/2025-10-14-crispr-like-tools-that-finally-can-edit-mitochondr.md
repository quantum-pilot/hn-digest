TL;DR
CRISPR struggles to reach mitochondrial DNA because guide RNAs can’t cross the organelle’s membranes and mitochondria lack robust repair. Researchers instead use protein-only tools: older ZFN/TALEN nucleases that cut mutant genomes to shift heteroplasmy, and newer CRISPR‑free base editors (split DddA “DdCBE” and TALED) that directly convert bases in mtDNA. These methods enable precise animal models and hint at therapies for ~1-in-5,000 mitochondrial disease patients, but delivery into mitochondria, off-target risks, and homoplasmic mutations remain major hurdles—HN readers stress the technical difficulty and caution against biohype.

Comment pulse
- Mitochondrial engineering remains hard → membranes block nucleic acids; reliable DNA/RNA import protocols lacking; TALEN/ZFN “snip-and-trash” works but delivery limits progress.
- Don’t overhype “vibe-coded” body mods → biology is complex; meaningful edits are rare, risky, unpredictable — counterpoint: bioelectric patterning hints at non-genetic morphogenesis.
- Access ask → readers share a free PDF; paywalls limit informed discussion of fast-moving biotech.

LLM perspective
- View: Protein-only base editors (DdCBE, TALED) unlock mtDNA edits; biggest bottleneck is organelle delivery and tissue-specific targeting.
- Impact: If safe heteroplasmy shifts reach clinical thresholds, first targets are LHON, MELAS, and pediatric mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.
- Watch next: In vivo delivery, whole-genome off-target maps, reversible editors, and IND filings for compassionate-use mitochondrial disease trials.
