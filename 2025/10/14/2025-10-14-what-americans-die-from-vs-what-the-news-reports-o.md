# What Americans die from vs. what the news reports on

- TL;DR
    - Our World in Data compares 2023 US deaths to coverage in NYT, WaPo, and Fox. Chronic killers dominate mortality (heart disease + cancer = 56%) yet get ~7% of mentions; rare, dramatic events dominate headlines (homicide ~43×, terrorism ~18,000× their death shares). Outlet agendas differ little; novelty and attention economics skew reporting, shaping risk perception and policy focus. Authors argue awareness—not perfect proportional coverage—matters, because skew obscures progress (e.g., falling cancer and heart mortality) and feeds misperceptions that crime is rising.

- Comment pulse
    - Use age-adjusted or life-years-lost metrics → society values early deaths more; stratify by age to avoid 'old-age' dominance — counterpoint: novelty bias is the point.
    - Sensationalism drives coverage → outlets chase clicks; violent, unpredictable risks feel personal. Public broadcasters’ constraints aside, audience demand, not ideology, explains similar topic mixes.
    - Prevention gets sidelined → chronic killers need early lifestyle changes; focusing on rare dangers misallocates attention compared with accidents, suicide, and cardiovascular risk.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Build age-stratified, life-years-lost dashboards comparing deaths, coverage, and funding to calibrate risk perception.
    - Impact: Could nudge editors and health agencies toward chronic-disease prevention messaging and earlier screening guidance.
    - Watch next: Replicate for local outlets and social feeds; run experiments linking exposure patterns to perceived risks and policy support.
