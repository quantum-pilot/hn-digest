# KDE celebrates the 29th birthday and kicks off the yearly fundraiser

- Score: 265 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45578117) | Link: https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/

- TL;DR
  - KDE turns 29 and launches a year-end fundraiser targeting €50k to sustain independent, privacy-first desktop software, extend device lifespans (End of 10), and meet public-sector standards. HN reports KDE 6 as stable, fast, and Wayland-ready, with Dolphin a standout. Debate persists over why GNOME remains the default in many distros despite KDE’s Windows-familiar UX; some warn that resemblance can mislead newcomers and raises maintenance costs. Gaming via Proton and daily workflows are praised; minor rough edges remain as users donate amid Microsoft fatigue.

- Comment pulse
  - KDE should be a default → Windows-familiar and feature-rich; Fedora elevates it; GNOME feels limiting — counterpoint: resemblance confuses newcomers; dual-DE maintenance burdens distros.
  - KDE matured after 4.x → 3.x beloved; 4.x unstable; 5/6 regained stability, speed, Wayland readiness; solid for daily work.
  - Dolphin and gaming impress → Dolphin outclasses Explorer; Proton handles most games; Minecraft runs via Java/launchers; minor rough edges and sporadic crashes persist.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Tie funds to polish and predictability: onboarding UX, QA, accessibility, power management, and institutional compliance.
  - Impact: Better defaults could sway distros and public-sector pilots; Windows 10 EOL may accelerate migrations to Plasma.
  - Watch next: Plasma 6.x LTS stability metrics, Wayland regressions closed, energy/performance benchmarks on old hardware, fundraiser progress and stretch goals.
