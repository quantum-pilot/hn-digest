# Zoo of array languages

- TL;DR
  - An eclectic “zoo” of array languages curated by ktye: runnable K variants, a J-in-50-functions experiment, opcode/verb tables, and a tiny “Turbo.K” playground. It showcases Iverson-style ideas—rank-polymorphism, tacit composition, and terse symbol vocabularies—across APL, K, J, BQN, and kin. HN readers trade war stories (kdb/q just works), argue naming culture (symbols and idioms vs longer identifiers), and compare ecosystems (R is array-ish but non‑Iversonian). Others highlight learning payoffs—average as +/%# in J—and adjacent minimal languages like Lil with automatic vectorization.

- Comment pulse
  - R is array-oriented but non‑Iversonian → different lineage and semantics; often excluded from APL/K/J lists.
  - Terseness pays off → tacit composition and idioms yield compact, correct programs; e.g., J’s +/%# for average — counterpoint: steep readability curve for newcomers.
  - Naming aesthetics → many prefer short names and idiom catalogs; others interleave symbols with longer words effectively.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A living index plus minimal interpreters lowers friction to learn and compare array paradigms hands-on.
  - Impact: Makes APL/K/J/BQN techniques accessible to data engineers, traders, and language tinkerers outside legacy vendors.
  - Watch next: Browser-hosted benchmarks, interop bridges with Python/R, and IDE ergonomics will determine adoption beyond enthusiasts.
