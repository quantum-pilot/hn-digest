- TL;DR
    - An international team used a global VLBI “super-telescope” and new gravitational-imaging algorithms to spot a million-solar-mass, starless dark object 10 billion light‑years away, via its subtle distortion of a lensed radio galaxy. It’s the lowest-mass dark lens yet found by roughly 100×, matching cold dark matter predictions of numerous subhalos. HN discussion centers on what “dark” means (non‑EM‑interacting mass), the method’s novelty and selection bias, and the mix of existential awe and pragmatism that space research evokes.

- Comment pulse
    - Dark object = dark matter subhalo detectable only via lensing → no optical/IR/radio emission; signature inconsistent with black hole — counterpoint: “dark” colloquially includes rocks/planets.
    - New gravitational imaging is promising but early → expect selection bias and long-tail anomalies; need multiple detections to contextualize and constrain subhalo abundances.
    - Cosmic scale provokes existential awe → some find humility and meaning; others note “imaging” here parallels MRI/CT reconstruction, not a direct photo.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Extends subhalo detection to cosmological distances and low masses, enabling tests of the subhalo mass function beyond the Local Group.
    - Impact: Tighter counts and profiles could exclude warm or self-interacting dark matter; informs feedback models shaping dwarf galaxies at z~2.
    - Watch next: Repeat on more lenses with VLBI/SKA; deep JWST follow-up for any baryons; publish mass-function constraints vs CDM predictions.
