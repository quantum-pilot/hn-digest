- TL;DR
  - Major outlets including the New York Times, AP, and Newsmax say they won’t sign new Pentagon press-access rules that reportedly require preapproval and restrict unsanctioned sourcing. Commenters frame this as a press-freedom and incentives problem: signers would become stenographers, while refusers must investigate outside official channels. Legal debate centers on First Amendment limits—viewpoint discrimination versus “equal terms” workarounds—and whether conditioning access chills speech. One America News reportedly plans to sign, underscoring partisan splits. Some also criticized a Pentagon spokesman’s dismissive rhetoric.

- Comment pulse
  - Refusing is right → Signing reduces journalism to republishing press releases; economically pointless to employ reporters for state-sanctioned copy.
  - Rules chill speech → Threat of revoked access coerces editorial compliance, even if applied uniformly — counterpoint: access can be conditioned like standard terms-of-service.
  - Expect more digging → Denied embeds, outlets will cultivate insiders, FOIAs, and leaks; anticipate more adversarial coverage and fewer staged briefings cited.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Boycotting access shifts leverage to reporters’ sources, documents, and open-source intel over staged briefings.
  - Impact: DOD narratives face less uncritical amplification; reputational risk grows if only partisan outlets attend.
  - Watch next: The exact rule text, any First Amendment challenges, FOIA backlogs, and whether Pentagon revises or rescinds conditions.
