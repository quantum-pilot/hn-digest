# Half of America's Voting Machines Are Now Owned by a MAGA Oligarch

- TL;DR
    - The article claims GOP operative Scott Leiendecker, whose KNOWiNK e‑pollbooks verify voters in many states, acquired Dominion (rebranding to Liberty Vote), consolidating influence over voter check‑in and machine tabulation (reportedly covering “over half” of voters). He pledged to follow Trump’s election executive order echoing the SAVE Act, which critics and a court say risks unconstitutional voter‑roll purges and burdensome citizenship proof. It also flags internet‑connected pollbooks and party‑run “integrity teams” as abuse vectors. HN debates concentration risk, paper/optical‑scan with risk‑limiting audits, and opaque deal financing.

- Comment pulse
    - Concentration risk → One vendor spanning pollbooks and tabulators is point of failure; some say affiliation irrelevant — counterpoint: after Jan 6, party control matters.
    - Go paper-first, not machine-free → Paper ballots + optical scan + risk-limiting audits scale to 20+ contests; pure hand counts are slow.
    - Transparency questions → How a <$20M vendor financed Dominion’s acquisition remains unexplained; calls for financing and governance disclosures.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Prioritize software‑independent paper records and decentralization; require public certification and disclosure for e‑pollbooks, not just tabulators.
    - Impact: Procurement officers and secretaries of state face pressure to diversify vendors, mandate RLAs, and hard‑ban live connectivity at polls.
    - Watch next: Verify deal financing, governance controls, EAC certifications, red‑team results, and DOJ/FTC or state AG probes of concentration.
