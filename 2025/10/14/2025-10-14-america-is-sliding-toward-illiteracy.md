# America Is Sliding Toward Illiteracy

- Score: 233 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583730) | Link: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/education-decline-low-expectations/684526/

- TL;DR
  - U.S. scores have fallen to late-1990s levels, with sharp declines among the bottom decile. The Atlantic pins some blame on smartphones but more on low expectations—grade inflation, social promotion, and “equitable” grading—while noting pandemic funds underdelivered. Evidence-backed progress comes from Mississippi/Louisiana: phonics-based early literacy, promotion gates, and coaching; research also supports some charters and merit pay. HN focuses on affluent kids holding steady, screens vs pedagogy, and whether raising standards without rebuilding the teacher workforce will widen inequality.

- Comment pulse
  - Affluent students hold steady → parent involvement, phonics, and phone limits; property-tax segregation entrenches unequal expectations — counterpoint: article shows top decile never declined.
  - Raise bars and retain when needed → Mississippi/Louisiana improved via promotion gates and coaching; but without more good teachers, higher standards risk exclusions and dropouts.
  - Screens vs pedagogy → some blame attention erosion from devices (including parents’) more than curricula; others note “books at home” is correlational, not causal.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Pair smartphone bans with evidence-based literacy, tutoring, and restored accountability; fund teacher pipeline, pay, and coaching over gadgets.
  - Impact: Low-income districts gain most; unions face merit-pay debates; charters expand; edtech hardware budgets shrink in favor of human capital.
  - Watch next: NAEP 2026 bottom-decile movement; RCTs on phone bans and high-dosage tutoring; state adoption of science-of-reading with promotion thresholds.
