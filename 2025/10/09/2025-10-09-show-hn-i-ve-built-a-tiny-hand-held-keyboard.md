# Show HN: I've built a tiny hand-held keyboard

- Score: 258 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45529393) | Link: https://github.com/mafik/keyer

- TL;DR
  - A DIY one-handed chorded keyboard “Keyer” uses 10 mechanical switches to enter text via up to 215 chords plus arpeggios, multiple layers; firmware on ESP32-S3 BLE with interrupt-driven low-latency; months-long 18650 battery; built from COTS parts and oven-baked modeling clay, no PCB, <$50. A layout generator optimizes chords for text and finger ergonomics. HN loves the hacker build and portability, requests a demo video and typing-speed benchmarks, and some were confused by “chords/arpeggios” thinking musical use; others reference historic keyers like WriteHander.

- Comment pulse
  - Show a typing demo video → assess learning curve, WPM, error rate; clarify “chords/arpeggios” are for text, not music — counterpoint: naming confused several readers.
  - Hacker-friendly build → COTS ESP32, 18650 battery, mechanical switches, modeling clay; cheap, no PCB, easy to mod.
  - Precedent and use cases → recalls WriteHander and palm keyers; promising for mobile/AR or phone/Termux typing without glass.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Chorded input thrives with personalized layouts and practice; tooling lowers barriers, but training time remains the hurdle.
  - Impact: Best for power users, accessibility, field work, and XR when one hand is busy and screens are awkward.
  - Watch next: Publish WPM curves, comparative layouts, latency numbers, and a build video; explore IMU air-mouse mode and smartphone HID.
