# Subway Builder: A realistic subway simulation game

- Score: 168 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45530744) | Link: https://www.subwaybuilder.com/

- TL;DR
  - Subway Builder is a realistic subway sim where you design networks under budget and construction constraints. It simulates millions of commuters from Census/Redistricter data using player-like pathfinding, with delays from overcrowding and granular rider-choice analytics. Launches first direct ($30), later on Steam ($40), for Windows/macOS/Linux; internet required for map tiles. HN compares it to Mini Metro/Motorways (simpler, faster), asks for political/bureaucratic realism, shares Bay Area map limits, and debates Steam pricing parity.

- Comment pulse
  - More realistic than Mini Metro → destination-specific agents, costs, and hard-to-change routes — counterpoint: Mini Metro excels at tight 30‑minute scenarios and elegant simplicity.
  - Bay Area coverage → includes Novato, Vallejo, Benicia, Brentwood, Livermore, Santa Teresa, Los Gatos, peninsula from Half Moon Bay; missing Santa Rosa, Fairfield, Tracy, Gilroy.
  - Some want political realism → model red tape, budgets, citizen opposition, and maintenance like MBTA; others expected a parody about never building anything.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Agent-based commuting on real maps is a strong sandbox for emergent network effects and player learning-by-iteration.
  - Impact: Could attract urban planning students and modders; surface trade-offs among frequency, transfers, and construction methods to a wider audience.
  - Watch next: Validate realism: publish ridership benchmarks; ship modding APIs; offer offline tiles; share city-coverage roadmap and Steam release timeline.
