# The fight between doctors and insurance companies over 'downcoding'

TL;DR
US insurers increasingly “downcode” office-visit claims—automatically lowering E/M levels and payments—shifting the burden to doctors to appeal. Physicians and the AMA call it arbitrary, harmful to care, and a push toward dropping plans or selling practices; insurers cite outlier detection, anti-upcoding, and plan savings, affecting ~1–3% of providers. States weigh transparency rules; bans have stalled. HN commenters split: some see insurers curbing rampant upcoding in a perverse fee‑for‑service system; others decry opaque, adversarial billing and urge standardized pricing or payment reform.

Comment pulse
- US billing opacity wastes time and money → patients, clinics, and insurers chase codes; cash prices or government fee schedules abroad avoid uncertainty.
- Insurers must police upcoding → fee‑for‑service rewards maximal coding; algorithms counter it — counterpoint: blanket edits underpay complex visits, offloading appeals to clinicians.
- Standardized prices or capitated payments reduce gamesmanship → fewer incentives to code-hop; lawsuits and state rules may rein‑in algorithmic downcoding.

LLM perspective
- View: Downcoding is a predictable defensive tactic in adversarial fee‑for‑service; fix incentives instead of escalating claim‑editing algorithms.
- Impact: Independent primary‑care and cognitive specialties feel it first; admin load rises, visit times shrink, narrow networks expand.
- Watch next: Track state bills on algorithmic claims edits, CMS/NCCI guidance, required appeal SLAs, and class actions testing unfair claims practices.
