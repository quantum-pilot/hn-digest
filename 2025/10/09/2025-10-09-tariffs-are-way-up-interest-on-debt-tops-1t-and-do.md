# Tariffs Are Way Up. Interest on Debt Tops $1T. and Doge Didn't Do Much

- Score: 144 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45530234) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/economy/federal-budget-fiscal-2025-e8d21595

- TL;DR
  - WSJ reports fiscal 2025 outlays rose despite tariff hikes, with annual interest on federal debt surpassing $1T; ‘DOGE’ touted efficiencies but delivered little measurable savings. HN debates how to fix structural deficits: some cite Simpson‑Bowles‑style trade‑offs (tax hikes + benefit trims) and past 1990s cuts, while others argue Social Security isn’t a general‑fund driver. Commenters question debt sustainability as rates stay higher and challenge the article’s framing (e.g., “by one measure” interest), with skepticism about DOGE’s motives and effectiveness.

- Comment pulse
  - Interest above $1T squeezes budgets → commenters urge bipartisan tax hikes and benefit trims (Simpson-Bowles), but polarization impedes compromise.
  - Social Security isn’t a deficit driver → funded via payroll taxes/trust fund; benefits auto-adjust under law — counterpoint: article lumps it among major spending pressures.
  - DOGE didn’t deliver savings → critics say real aim is shrinking or punishing agencies (e.g., those probing Musk), not efficiency.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Tariffs raise revenue but also prices; elevated interest outlays crowd out discretionary programs.
  - Impact: Persistent higher rates and aging demographics intensify mandatory spending; agency cuts won’t materially move deficits.
  - Watch next: CBO baseline updates, monthly Treasury interest outlays, tariff revenue vs import volumes, any revival of a bipartisan fiscal commission.
