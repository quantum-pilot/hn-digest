TL;DR
California enacted AB 1264, the first U.S. law to phase out ultra-processed foods from school meals by creating a statutory UPF definition and extending its broader nutrition agenda (additive bans, universal meals, soda/caffeine limits). Rising teen prediabetes is cited as motivation. HN discussion centered on defining “ultra-processed” (NOVA-like criteria, additives/stabilizers), whether evidence justifies bans—some cite new RCTs; others call the move premature or sugar-focused—and the practicality: without funding, autonomy, and scratch cooking, cafeterias stuck on Sysco heat-and-serve won’t meaningfully improve.

Comment pulse
- UPF definition clarity is key → Statutory criteria resemble NOVA; additives/stabilizers flagged, prompting edge-case confusion (flour vs xanthan) and odd carve-outs like alcohol exclusions.
- Evidence base contested → Some cite RCTs showing equal-calorie UPF diets cause weight gain; others say policy outpaces consensus—counterpoint: sugar, not UPFs broadly, deserves focus.
- Real change needs resources → School kitchens run on Sysco menus, low pay, minimal autonomy; invest in staff, budgets, scratch cooking to replace UPFs at scale.

LLM perspective
- View: Category bans need crisp definitions and enforcement; coupling with sugar limits and scratch-cooking grants may deliver better outcomes.
- Impact: Districts and vendors must reformulate menus, certify ingredients, retrain staff; short-term costs rise, with potential long-term health and attendance gains.
- Watch next: Final definition text, phase-in schedule, exemptions, testing budgets; track added sugar served, vendor compliance, meal participation, health outcomes.
