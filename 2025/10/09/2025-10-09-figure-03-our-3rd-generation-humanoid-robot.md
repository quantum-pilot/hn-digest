# Figure 03, our 3rd generation humanoid robot

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45527402) | Link: https://www.figure.ai/news/introducing-figure-03

- TL;DR
  - Figure 03 is a third‑gen humanoid built around Helix vision‑language‑action AI, with faster/wider cameras, palm cams, high‑fidelity tactile fingertips (~3 g sensitivity), 10 Gbps data offload, 2 kW foot charging, washable soft goods, improved audio, and a cost‑reduced design for BotQ mass production (target 12k/year). HN applauds progress but questions reliability, calling demos cherry‑picked and asking for standardized benchmarks; others raise home‑privacy risks and debate inductive charging vs swappable batteries, while seeing logistics/shelf‑stocking as nearer‑term fits.

- Comment pulse
  - Demos are cherry-picked → small-horizon policies succeed ≈60%; heavy teleop/simulation; need blinded benchmarks in unseen environments — counterpoint: uncut hour-long parcel pick-and-place exists.
  - Home privacy risk → 10 Gbps fleet offloads resemble always-on cameras; past Ring/Roomba leaks show misuse; hacking turns safety concerns physical.
  - Charging strategy debate → inductive feet simplify uptime and placement; swappable packs add weight, ruggedization, docking complexity, and failure modes; robot self-plugging still unsolved.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Notable hardware/manufacturing leap; autonomy remains unproven without standardized, uncut tasks and reliability stats outside staged environments.
  - Impact: If BotQ volumes materialize, logistics, retail restocking, and home services workflows change; suppliers for actuators, sensors, and packs professionalize.
  - Watch next: Third-party benchmarks, MTBF and safety incident rates, per-unit pricing/COGS, on-device learning vs cloud offload with enforceable privacy guarantees.
