# N8n raises $180M

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45525336) | Link: https://blog.n8n.io/series-c/

- TL;DR
    - n8n raised $180M Series C (total $240M) at $2.5B to push AI “orchestration + coordination”: a platform balancing agent autonomy with enforceable logic, wiring models to tools/data, with human-in-the-loop, monitoring, and evaluations. They tout open-core flexibility (any model, deploy anywhere), rapid growth, and new features like Evaluations and Data Tables. HN debates: self-hosted licensing/execution caps and suitability as a backend; strong integrations but visual complexity and scaling tradeoffs; and whether the funding fuels GTM/GPU spend versus engineering.

- Comment pulse
    - Self-hosted licensing caps executions; exceeding stops workflows—deal-breaker for backend replacement. Alternatives: Node-RED, Activepieces — counterpoint: negotiate unlimited; it’s an orchestrator, not a backend.
    - Product is stable with many integrations and community templates; rapid prototyping shines. Complex “visual code” gets hard to maintain; compute/memory-heavy nodes scale inefficiently.
    - Funding size questioned; skeptics expect marketing-heavy burn in 2–3 years. Others cite GTM hiring and potential GPU/cloud costs for AI features.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Orchestrators that mix guardrailed logic with agent autonomy will win enterprise AI adoption over fully autonomous or rigid rule engines.
    - Impact: Most impact for platform teams integrating LLMs into workflows, SMBs without ML staff, and vendors extending nodes/marketplaces.
    - Watch next: Pricing/limits for self-hosted, reliability/observability tooling, standard evaluations, and comparative benchmarks versus Zapier, Make, Node‑RED on throughput and cost.
