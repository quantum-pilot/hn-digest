# The React Foundation

- Score: 298 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45524624) | Link: https://engineering.fb.com/2025/10/07/open-source/introducing-the-react-foundation-the-new-home-for-react-react-native/

- TL;DR
  - Meta is moving React, React Native and related projects to a new React Foundation under the Linux Foundation, with a board spanning Amazon, Microsoft, Vercel and others. Business governance sits in the foundation; technical direction will be set by maintainers via a separate structure. Meta commits five years and $3M plus engineers. HN welcomes broader stewardship but worries about Vercel’s influence, RSC’s opaque, Next.js-centric design, and React’s growing complexity; others note React’s long-term stability and alternatives like Preact/Vue.

- Comment pulse
  - Vercel's influence risks lock-in → RSC built closely with Next.js; docs felt Vercel-biased. — counterpoint: Board and governance split aim to limit single-vendor control.
  - React complexity keeps rising → hooks, concurrent rendering, RSC increase cognitive load; some switch to Vue/Angular signals; Preact offers lighter drop-in path.
  - React remains stable for long-lived apps → decade-old codebases endure; Jest wasn’t killed; but class-to-hooks migrations cost teams significant effort.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Linux Foundation umbrella and board diversify stewardship; real test is independent technical governance and open specs for major features.
  - Impact: Enterprises gain predictability; framework authors and infra vendors get a forum; potential check on Next.js-centered decisions.
  - Watch next: Governance charter, technical steering committee members, RSC and concurrency specs, compatibility baselines, funding beyond Meta’s $3M.
