# California enacts law enabling people to universally opt out of data sharing

- TL;DR
    - California’s new law forces browsers to offer a simple, universal opt‑out for the sale/sharing of personal data, operationalizing CCPA’s rights without extensions. Activists expect broader use; other bills require easy social‑media account cancellation with full data deletion and expand data‑broker transparency. HN debates enforcement: without penalties or private lawsuits, it could become Do‑Not‑Track 2.0. Some note no mandated signal spec and uncertainty on mobile OS. Others fear more popups; CCPA’s 12‑month re‑prompt limit may curb that.

- Comment pulse
    - Strengthen enforcement → CPPA/AG-only model and arbitration waivers blunt deterrence; allow class actions or mandate agency action — counterpoint: courts uphold waivers, limiting class suits.
    - Do Not Track déjà vu → past header ignored; enabling signals can aid fingerprinting, paradoxically increasing tracking.
    - Patchwork hurts small firms → giants “use” rather than sell data; universal opt-out may mainly burden smaller adtech and publishers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Signal without specs or penalties risks DNT 2.0; pairing with CCPA/GPC and audits is essential.
    - Impact: Browsers add a one-click control; adtech shifts to first‑party data; mobile OS inclusion would widen reach.
    - Watch next: CPPA rulemaking defining the signal, test suites for compliance, and first AG/CPPA enforcement against noncompliant majors.
