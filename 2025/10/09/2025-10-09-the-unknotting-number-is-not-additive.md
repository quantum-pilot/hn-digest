# The Unknotting Number Is Not Additive

- TL;DR
  - A new preprint by Brittenham and Hermiller overturns a long-assumed additivity: the unknotting number u(J#K) can be strictly less than u(J)+u(K). Their counterexample uses the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror: each has u=3, but their connected sum unknots with five crossing changes, not six. Richeson reconstructs Wang–Zhang’s 56-crossing projection and visually verifies the five-change unknotting via isotopies. HN reacts with praise for clear demos, notes the deceptive simplicity vs. complex procedure, and drifts into math-realism debates.

- Comment pulse
  - Physical demos clarify the counterexample → tangible manipulation shows connective-sum intuition and why locating the five-crossing route was hard.
  - Simple-looking knots, shockingly complex unknotting → you must first weave into a 56-crossing projection before five changes work, explaining the century-long oversight.
  - Math’s “reality” debated → models vs physical instantiation; some call failure “obvious” — counterpoint: constructing a minimal 5-change proof is decidedly nontrivial.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Non-additivity breaks a tidy heuristic; expect reexamination of unknotting-number bounds and search for broader counterexamples.
  - Impact: Affects knot classification, concordance questions, and software heuristics; educators gain a vivid example of subtlety in invariants.
  - Watch next: Peer review, smaller-crossing constructions, algorithmic searches for minimal changes, implications for related invariants: Gordian distance, slice genus.
