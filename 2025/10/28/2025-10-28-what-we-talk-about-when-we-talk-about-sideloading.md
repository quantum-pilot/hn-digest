# What we talk about when we talk about sideloading

- Score: 878 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45736479) | Link: https://f-droid.org/2025/10/28/sideloading.html

- TL;DR
  - F-Droid argues Google’s new developer verification effectively ends true sideloading on Android: installs from non–Google-approved sources will be blocked unless developers register, identify themselves, and accept Play-era policies across all certified devices. They dispute Google’s malware claims and warn of harms to user autonomy, indie distribution, and digital sovereignty, urging resistance. HN debate weighs security benefits of vetted channels versus trust in F-Droid, the role of platform taxes in restricting sideloading, ADB “loopholes,” and rising hardware attestation that could close remaining paths.

- Comment pulse
  - Security channel helps—warning popups alone don’t. F-Droid seen as trustworthy; Play isn’t. New policy blocks installs unless devs register with Google.
  - Platform tax creates incentive to bypass stores; making sideload hard preserves the vig—solve the tax, reduce sideload pressure.
  - Users want full device control; DMCA 1201 criminalizes sharing unlock tools—counterpoint: total control risks security, updates, and liability.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Shift from technical openness to identity-gated installs; ADB path can be throttled by attestation and policy.
  - Impact: Hurts F-Droid, indie dev distribution, enterprise/internal apps, and governments seeking software sovereignty.
  - Watch next: Android release notes, device certification changes, real-world block rates; regulatory moves from EU DMA, US DOJ, India CCI.
