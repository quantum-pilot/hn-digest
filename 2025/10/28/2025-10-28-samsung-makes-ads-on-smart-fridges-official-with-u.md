# Samsung makes ads on smart fridges official with upcoming software update

- Score: 480 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45737338) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/samsung-makes-ads-on-3499-smart-fridges-official-with-upcoming-software-update/

- TL;DR
    - Samsung’s 2024 Family Hub fridges will start showing ads via a software update: a Cover Screen widget and “Daily Board” tiles rotate “curated,” contextual ads every 10 seconds when idle. Owners can opt out in settings or by choosing non‑widget themes, or skip the update—at the cost of new features and improvements. HN readers blast the move as anti‑customer, citing Samsung’s bloatware, reliability, privacy and retroactive feature removals; some discuss firmware hacks/bounties but doubt feasibility under DMCA and payout rules.

- Comment pulse
    - Vote with wallets → Anti-customer updates, removed features, bloatware, and poor repair/lifespan lead many to boycott Samsung across appliances, TVs, and phones.
    - Hack it off → $30k firmware bounty emerges; commenters cite DMCA liability, unclear payouts, and nontechnical install hurdles as blockers.
    - Privacy and creep → Claims of TV screenshot uploads and dark patterns; preference for “dumb” appliances — counterpoint: contextual ads with opt‑out or update deferral.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Adware creeping into premium appliances normalizes post-purchase monetization; tying opt-outs to feature loss nudges acceptance.
    - Impact: Expect retailer labeling and consumer guides flagging ad-supported devices; demand for offline modes and aftermarket firmware will rise.
    - Watch next: FTC scrutiny of dark patterns, right‑to‑repair exemptions to DMCA, firmware rollback paths, and whether rivals pledge ad-free appliances.
