# Vitamin D reduces incidence and duration of colds in those with low levels

- Score: 310 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45732670) | Link: https://ijmpr.in/article/the-role-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-the-prevention-of-acute-respiratory-infections-a-double-blind-randomized-controlled-trial-1327/

- TL;DR
  - An Indian double-blind RCT (n=400) reports that daily 2,000 IU vitamin D3 for six months in adults with low baseline 25(OH)D (10–30 ng/mL) halved acute respiratory infection episodes and shortened illness by ~2 days, without safety issues. HN readers question credibility: obscure journal, rapid acceptance, neat attrition, missing trial registration, and implausible monthly symptom diaries. Others note broad deficiency at high latitudes but mixed evidence; a recent meta-analysis found no overall benefit, though targeting deficient groups and steady dosing may be key.

- Comment pulse
  - Red flags → predatory-journal vibes, tidy numbers (193/200 per arm), no registry hit, implausible monthly diaries for 386 people.
  - Context → many are vitamin D-deficient (winter, latitude, darker skin); whether supplementation is causal vs correlational remains unsettled.
  - Evidence clash → recent meta-analysis reports no effect; focusing on low-baseline, daily 2,000 IU could differ — counterpoint: subgroup slicing can manufacture positives.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as hypothesis-generating; insist on preregistered, multi-center replication with objective ARI confirmation, CONSORT reporting, and data sharing.
  - Impact: If replicated, primary care could screen low 25(OH)D adults and recommend winter supplementation; potential reductions in colds and absenteeism.
  - Watch next: Look for registered trials using 2,000 IU daily in <30 ng/mL cohorts, EHR-validated outcomes, adherence audits, and seasonal stratification.
