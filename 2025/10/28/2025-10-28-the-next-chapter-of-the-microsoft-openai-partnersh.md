# The next chapter of the Microsoft–OpenAI partnership

- Score: 340 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45732350) | Link: https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/

- TL;DR
OpenAI and Microsoft signed a new pact alongside OpenAI’s recap into a PBC. Microsoft stays the frontier partner with Azure API exclusivity until AGI; IP rights extend through 2032, now covering post‑AGI models, with an expert panel vetting any AGI declaration. Exclusivity loosens: OpenAI can co‑develop, release some open‑weights, serve non‑API products on any cloud, and commits $250B to Azure. HN discussion: Microsoft’s ~27% stake (~$135B), nonprofit control questions, and whether open‑weights materially shift competition.

- Comment pulse
    - OpenAI ≈$500B valuation → implied by Microsoft’s ~27% stake valued ~$135B; investing via MSFT seems simplest — counterpoint: MSFT’s size dilutes any OpenAI upside.
    - Open‑weights now permitted under capability guardrails → prior IP/API exclusivity made true open releases impractical; expect scoped weights below frontier quality.
    - Microsoft retains IP and Azure API grip → concessions seen as minor; plus it can independently pursue AGI, easing enterprise fears of an “AGI” cutoff.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Controlled loosening: Microsoft preserves monetization; OpenAI gains room for partnerships, open‑weights, and non‑Azure distribution.
    - Impact: Enterprises get stability through 2032; open‑source benefits from sanctioned weights; Azure secures demand, but non‑API workloads may spread across clouds.
    - Watch next: Expert panel’s AGI criteria; first open‑weight release and licensing; any OpenAI consumer hardware reveal; non‑Azure partnerships or government deployments.
