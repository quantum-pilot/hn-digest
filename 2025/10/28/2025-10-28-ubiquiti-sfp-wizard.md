# Ubiquiti SFP Wizard

- Score: 220 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45732874) | Link: https://blog.ui.com/article/welcome-to-sfp-liberation-day

- TL;DR
    - Ubiquiti’s $49 SFP Wizard is a pocket programmer/diagnostic tool for SFP/QSFP optics with OTA updates, launched alongside steep price cuts on 1G–100G modules. It aims to bypass vendor lock-in by copying profiles from any optic to a Ubiquiti module. HN notes similar tools (Flexoptix, FS.com) have existed; the standout here is price and simplicity. Questions remain about diagnostic depth and whether write support is UI-only. Pricing looks aggressive versus FS on many SKUs, with caveats on 10G LR and promo longevity.

- Comment pulse
    - “Liberation” isn’t new → Flexoptix/FS already reprogram optics; UB’s novelty is a $49 pocket tool—counterpoint: some never hit lock-in or TAC refusals.
    - Pricing → UB undercuts FS on several modules and programmer cost; 10G LR remains pricier; concern that launch discounts may not last.
    - Field reality → Users report Mikrotik/SFP+ quirks and heat; others see near-zero issues—counterpoint: keep a few vendor-coded optics for support.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Cheap, simple optics programming normalizes vendor-neutral deployments and trims spare-part SKUs.
    - Impact: SMBs/ISPs/homelabs cut costs, speed turn-ups, and reduce compatibility escalations.
    - Watch next: Independent tests of Rx/Tx accuracy, confirm non-UI write support, post-promo pricing, and firmware feature cadence.
