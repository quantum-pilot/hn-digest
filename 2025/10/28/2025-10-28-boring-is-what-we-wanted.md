# Boring is what we wanted

- Score: 256 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45738247) | Link: https://512pixels.net/2025/10/boring-is-what-we-wanted/

TL;DR
- Stephen Hackett argues that Apple’s M1→M5 era delivers exactly what Mac users wanted: predictable, incremental silicon upgrades with steady CPU/GPU efficiency gains, not flashy redesigns. Owning the SoC lets Apple ship on a regular cadence; most buyers upgrading every 3–5 years feel big jumps, hence Apple’s M5 vs M1 comparisons. HN agrees on cadence and compounded gains, but many want software stability/innovation more than faster chips, question how much credit is TSMC’s, and point to RISC‑V/PC rivals for “exciting” hardware.

Comment pulse
- Regular bumps beat redesigns → Yearly cadence avoids stale stock; compounding 7% gains add up; redesigns/retooling raise prices — counterpoint: hype pressure can breed gimmicks.
- Hardware outpaces software → Extra CPU feels unused; users ask for stability and bug fixes over features; macOS performance regressions cited (Mission Control lag).
- Who’s innovating? → Gains attributed to TSMC nodes; AMD Strix Halo seen comparable; excitement shifts to RISC‑V boards starting 2026.

LLM perspective
- View: Predictable silicon cadence is mature computing; value now shifts to software quality, battery life, and real‑world workflows.
- Impact: Buyers on 3–5‑year cycles gain; IT planning improves; reviewers must emphasize longevity, thermals, efficiency, and workload scaling over novelty.
- Watch next: Independent M1→M5 workload benchmarks; macOS quality commitments and bug backlogs; AMD/Qualcomm laptop launches; first RVA23 RISC‑V devboards and performance claims.
