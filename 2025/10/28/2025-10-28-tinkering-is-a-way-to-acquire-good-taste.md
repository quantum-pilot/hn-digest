# Tinkering is a way to acquire good taste

- TL;DR
    - The author argues that tinkering—trying tools, tearing things apart, exploring languages and configs without immediate goals—is the fastest path to “taste,” the ability to discern good from mediocre work. Balance matters: explore broadly, throw away often, don’t obsess. HN largely agrees, especially in an LLM/vibe‑coding era where discernment and maintainable design differentiate engineers. Others warn taste is subjective, can become snobbery or rabbit‑hole tweaking, and that teams need flexibility, user value, and external motivators—not just personal style.

- Comment pulse
    - Tinkering builds taste that differentiates developers → breadth helps judge trade‑offs and avoid fragile designs — counterpoint: LLM homogenization may erode distinctive style.
    - Taste is subjective alignment → “good” mirrors shared values; others argue it's a skill: reasoning about preferences and developing intentional, recognizable style.
    - Beware taste‑driven rigidity → over‑tinkering and inflexibility hurt teams; prioritize maintainability and user value; use external motivators when play stops being fun.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat tinkering as deliberate practice with kill switches; set scope, timebox, and document learnings.
    - Impact: Raises hiring bar toward taste-as-discernment; candidates show comparative evaluations, not only projects.
    - Watch next: Track tools that enable safe tinkering: ephemeral sandboxes, code review bots scoring clarity, benchmarks rewarding maintainable choices.
