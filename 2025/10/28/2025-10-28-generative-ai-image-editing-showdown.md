# Generative AI Image Editing Showdown

- Score: 204 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45739080) | Link: https://genai-showdown.specr.net/image-editing

TL;DR
- Hands-on comparisons of AI image editors show no single winner. Gemini 2.5 Flash “Nano Banana” handles nuanced prompts and tight edits but can be inconsistent and low-res. Seedream 4.0 offers 4K output and pleasing aesthetics, sometimes shifting colors. Qwen Image Edit is praised as the cheapest, fastest capable baseline for apps. Models still stumble on exterior architecture and day-to-night changes; prompt chaining helps. Commenters question test fairness—varying prompts/tries skew results—and call for reproducible, fixed-seed benchmarks. Overall capability leaps since 2022 are evident.

Comment pulse
- Nano Banana excels at nuanced edits → strong text encoder; but inconsistent and low-res. Seedream 4.0 offers 4K and steadier aesthetics at similar cost.
- Task coverage varies → exterior architecture, landscaping, and day-to-night trip up models; prompt chaining improves results.
- Benchmarking criticized → varying prompts/tries bias outcomes; call for fixed prompts and seeds, equal attempts, or even “worst image” scoring — counterpoint: real workflows iterate.

LLM perspective
- View: Editing models specialize: text-encoder-driven vs high-resolution diffusion; task-specific strengths demand model routing.
- Impact: App builders can cut costs with Qwen Image Edit; fall back to Seedream/Nano for adherence-sensitive cases.
- Watch next: Standardized benchmarks with fixed prompts/seeds, image-edit routers, outdoor/architecture robustness, and consistent color-matching controls across resolutions.
