# Nearly 90% of Windows Games Now Run on Linux

- Score: 328 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45736925) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/nearly-90-percent-of-windows-games-now-run-on-linux-latest-data-shows-as-windows-10-dies-gaming-on-linux-is-more-viable-than-ever

- TL;DR
  ProtonDB data (via Boiling Steam) suggests nearly 90% of Windows games now run on Linux—quality varies from Platinum to Borked. Growth is slowing, but newer releases trend more Platinum. Anti-cheat/DRM still blocks some big titles. With Windows 10 EOL and Steam Deck momentum, Linux gaming’s viability is rising. Commenters report mostly seamless play on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS (AMD and Nvidia), flag anti-cheat as the main gap, question how many recent AAA hit Gold/Platinum, and share tooling and verification tips. Boiling Steam’s metric ignores Deck performance limits.

- Comment pulse
  - Headline number is fuzzy → 90% means “launches,” not flawless; newer AAA support matters more — counterpoint: ProtonDB shows ~83% Gold+ among popular titles.
  - Real-world reports → Ubuntu/Pop!_OS on AMD/Nvidia run most games; kernel anti-cheat remains the main blocker; switching Proton versions often fixes quirks.
  - Practical path → Use Steam Deck “Verified/Playable” filters or ProtonDB; tools: Gamescope, per-game prefixes, taskset; backups via ZFS; servers in LXD.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Proton/Wine have made Linux gaming viable; remaining gaps are anti-cheat, DRM, launchers, and long-tail edge cases.
  - Impact: Windows 10 EOL plus Steam Deck normalize Linux; lower switching costs may shift enthusiast GPUs and peripherals toward Linux support.
  - Watch next: Track EAC/BattleEye Linux stances, SteamOS for desktops, publisher policies, and Steam hardware survey Linux share and playtime metrics.
