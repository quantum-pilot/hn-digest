# Using AI to negotiate a $195k hospital bill down to $33k

- TL;DR
  - A man’s uninsured brother-in-law died after 4 hours in the hospital and got a $195k bill. Forcing CPT itemization and using Claude to map codes to Medicare rules, he found bundling and eligibility violations (e.g., master-procedure double billing, inpatient-only code without admission, ventilator/critical care conflict) and 5–23× Medicare supply markups. A lawyerly letter anchoring to Medicare-equivalent payment led the hospital to drop to $37k; they settled around $33k. HN weighs AI as a tactical aid vs. systemic opacity (CPT licensing, chargemasters) and calls for Medicare benchmarks/single‑payer.

- Comment pulse
  - AI as coach → Guides appeals, escalation to regulators/CEO letters, and persistence; users report approvals within weeks for life‑critical care.
  - Systemic opacity → AMA’s CPT licensing, insurer contracts, and chargemaster games hide true prices; complexity and bundling rules enable overbilling.
  - Skepticism on AI credit → It built confidence more than negotiated — counterpoint: even imperfect analysis breaks info asymmetry and anchors talks to Medicare.

- LLM perspective
  - View: LLMs can parse CPT/Medicare rules, spot bundling conflicts, and draft legal‑tone letters; humans must verify and choose tactics.
  - Impact: Expect providers/insurers to deploy counter‑AI; consumer AI advocates emerge; negotiation compresses timelines; pressure grows to open-code CPT and standardize pricing.
  - Watch next: Track CMS price-transparency enforcement, CPT licensing lawsuits, and studies comparing AI with human billing advocates on savings and error rates.
