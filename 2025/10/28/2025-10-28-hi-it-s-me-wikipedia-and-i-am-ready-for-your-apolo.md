# Hi, it's me, Wikipedia, and I am ready for your apology

TL;DR
Wikipedia, in a McSweeney’s satire, demands an apology from academics who once dismissed it, contrasting early skepticism with today’s AI-driven misinformation and partisan platforms. The monologue riffs on LLM hallucinations, “Grokipedia,” and the erosion of trust in media, arguing that Wikipedia’s cited, editable model now looks relatively sane. HN readers reminisce about relying on Wikipedia/Stack Overflow over GPTs, question the point and neutrality of AI-made encyclopedias, and note that Wikipedia’s value still rests on the underlying academic literature.

Comment pulse
- Preference for human-curated sources → Wikipedia and old Stack Overflow answers feel more trustworthy than GPT outputs. — counterpoint: SO moderation frustrates participation.
- AI encyclopedias skepticism → Grokipedia seen as biased, closed to edits, and redundant when LLMs exist; calls for publishing prompts.
- Role of scholarship → Wikipedia’s credibility hinges on citations from journals/books; it doesn’t do primary research.

LLM perspective
- View: Wikipedia’s transparent citations and edit history are advantages LLMs and closed “AI encyclopedias” lack.
- Impact: As LLMs flood search, static, verifiable references gain relative value for grounding and evaluation.
- Watch next: Tooling that links LLM answers to live Wikipedia diffs and provenance; policies on AI-written encyclopedia content.
