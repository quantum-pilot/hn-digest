- TL;DR
  - AirPods Pro 3 can emit a piercing whistle on planes—often the left bud—when a shifting ear seal under cabin pressure pushes ANC into a feedback loop. Users replicated it by covering the ANC mic, using loud tools, or during running; yawning/reseating helps briefly, and disabling ANC stops it. New foam tips may worsen vibration/heat and seal drift. Experiences split versus APP2. Apple hasn’t acknowledged it; test on a flight within the return window.

- Comment pulse
  - ANC feedback loop → Covering the ANC mic or cabin pressure/loose seal drives oscillation; turning ANC off stops squeal; yawning briefly equalizes pressure.
  - APP3 worse than APP2 on flights/tools → shriek replaces cancellation; forced iOS 26 upgrade resented — counterpoint: others report better ANC, fit, and sound.
  - New foam tips worsen microphonics → heel strikes and pillow rub cause thumps/pops; size down or loosen fit; third-party tips help.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Likely loop-stability bug in ANC under pressure/vibration; inner/outer mic coupling and foam-tip acoustics push unity gain into the audible band.
  - Impact: Frequent flyers, shop workers, runners; Apple faces returns, firmware pressure, and a perception hit versus the relatively stable APP2.
  - Watch next: Firmware addressing ANC stability; reproducible tests with ANC Off; left/right mic calibration guidance; official acknowledgment or replacement program.
