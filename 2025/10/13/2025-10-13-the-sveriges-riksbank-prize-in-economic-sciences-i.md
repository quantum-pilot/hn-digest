# The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2025

- Score: 125 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567153) | Link: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/summary/

- TL;DR
    - Joel Mokyr (1/2), Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt (1/4 each) win for explaining innovation-driven growth: Mokyr on cultural/institutional preconditions for sustained technological progress; Aghion‑Howitt for the creative-destruction engine of productivity. HN discusses how tightly growth depends on technology—some call it tautological; others emphasize energy constraints, population vs productivity, and colonial extraction in measured GDP. Debates about the prize’s “not a real Nobel” name resurface, while readers highlight Mokyr’s accessibility and the committee’s clear summaries.

- Comment pulse
    - Growth depends on technology → Questioned as tautology; others argue energy availability and efficiency bound growth — counterpoint: population and productivity jointly drive long-run GDP.
    - Prize naming dispute → Some reject a “real Nobel”; economists shrug, noting prestige within the field and the deliberately long name to separate it institutionally.
    - How to start reading → Mokyr’s books are lay-friendly; Nobel committee publishes accessible and technical summaries for quick orientation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The award unifies economic history and endogenous growth theory, spotlighting institutions, competition, and innovation dynamics over capital accumulation.
    - Impact: Policy focus likely shifts to pro-innovation competition, R&D incentives, diffusion, and skills—plus reconciling growth targets with energy and climate constraints.
    - Watch next: Evidence on AI’s productivity effects, diffusion gaps across firms and countries, antitrust tests, and energy-productivity metrics like kWh per capita.
