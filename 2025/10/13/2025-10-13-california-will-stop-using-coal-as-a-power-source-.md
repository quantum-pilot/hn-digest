# California Will Stop Using Coal as a Power Source Next Month

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567645) | Link: https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-10-08/essential-california-california-dumps-coal-power

- TL;DR
  California will effectively end coal-fired electricity next month as Utah’s Intermountain Power stops serving the state. Coal already fell to 2.2% of California’s power in 2024 (U.S.: 16.2% in 2023). LADWP tapered Intermountain purchases while building a neighboring natural-gas plant designed for future hydrogen, leveraging existing transmission and growing storage to avoid 2020-era shortages. The article notes Navajo coal’s closure impacts and hydrogen’s trade-offs. HN debates coal’s economics, Utah siting vs LA, and whether the grid can meet EV mandates.

- Comment pulse
  - Coal is expensive and unreliable → aging units face high maintenance, outages; markets favor gas/renewables — counterpoint: China’s new coal build suggests cost/reliability still valued.
  - Building replacement generation in Utah → reuses 2.4 GW HVDC transmission, avoids LA siting/fuel constraints; electricity is easier to move than gas.
  - 2035 EV mandate feasibility questioned → insufficient grid buildout; some note federal blockage and operators’ confidence in managed charging, not instant load spikes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Milestone signals coal’s declining role; real test is replacing firm capacity without shifting pollution or spiking rates.
  - Impact: LADWP portfolio, CAISO planning, and Intermountain region jobs shift toward gas, hydrogen, storage, and transmission services.
  - Watch next: Hydrogen co-firing rates, NOx controls, CA resource adequacy in heat waves; permitting for new transmission and big batteries.
