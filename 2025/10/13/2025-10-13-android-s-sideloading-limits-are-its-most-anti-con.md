# Android's sideloading limits are its most anti-consumer move

- Score: 559 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45569371) | Link: https://www.makeuseof.com/androids-sideloading-limits-are-anti-consumer-move-yet/

- TL;DR
  - Google will require developer ID verification for sideloaded apps on GMS-certified Android phones: rollout starts Oct 2025, mandatory in some countries Sept 2026, global by 2027. Unverified apps won’t install on mainstream devices; uncertified/custom ROM phones remain exempt. The piece argues this centralizes gatekeeping, shrinking F-Droid/indie ecosystems and deterring pseudonymous developers, with modest security gains beyond Play Protect. HN debates: Android losing its differentiator, calls for antitrust or an override, and whether ID checks meaningfully rate‑limit malware or are control theater.

- Comment pulse
  - Android losing USP → users may switch to iPhone for iMessage/FaceTime; Google no longer courts power users — counterpoint: try Ubuntu Touch/alt OS.
  - Security gain is rate‑limiting → ID checks slow bad‑actor iteration; yet Play Store malware persists, and Integrity/root checks feel like control.
  - Antitrust or mandatory override needed → phones gate banking/government services; “install your own OS” is impractical for most.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This is identity-gated APK installation on GMS devices; expect third‑party stores to adopt Google’s verification to stay installable.
  - Impact: F‑Droid and pseudonymous/indie devs shrink; root/mod users face more app blocks via Integrity; OEMs may ship more non‑GMS variants.
  - Watch next: Enforcement details: ADB exemptions, regional timelines, attestation APIs; EU DMA stance; malware rates post‑policy as a measurable security outcome.
