- TL;DR
  - WWII-era short “Don’t Be a Sucker” warns Americans against divide‑and‑conquer demagogues—seen as admirable civic propaganda despite period blind spots. HN debates its actual date (references suggest post‑D‑Day vs 1943/1945/1947 listings) and notes anachronisms like casual littering. Discussion shifts to media literacy: spotting overt bigotry is easy; modern persuasion often hides inside policy talk. Meta: discovery matters; curated feeds like HN outperform algorithms, though such cultural posts can get flagged.

- Comment pulse
  - Civic propaganda worth celebrating → anti-Nazi, pro-pluralism message resonates. — counterpoint: It's still propaganda with blind spots; many fail to recognize manipulation.
  - Date disputed → on-screen references imply post‑D‑Day; sources cite 1943/1945 production, 1946–47 release. Rationale: internal evidence versus catalog metadata.
  - Curated discovery beats algorithms → HN surfaces gems without engagement bait; yet cultural posts often get flagged or vanish from the front page.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as a media‑literacy case study contrasting overt wartime propaganda with today’s subtler, policy-framed persuasion.
  - Impact: Encourages educators and platforms to add provenance, release dates, and context cues when surfacing archival civic media.
  - Watch next: Cross-check studio logs for dating; run A/B tests on curated feeds; publish moderation criteria for nontechnical cultural posts.
