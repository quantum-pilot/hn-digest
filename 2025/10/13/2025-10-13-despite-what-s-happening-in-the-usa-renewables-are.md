# Despite what's happening in the USA, renewables are winning globally

- Score: 158 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45564077) | Link: https://thebulletin.org/2025/10/despite-whats-happening-in-the-usa-renewables-are-winning-globally/

- TL;DR
  - Ember’s mid-year data shows renewables—driven by cheap solar—overtook coal in global electricity for the first time; fossil generation dipped year-over-year. IEA expects renewable capacity to more than double by 2030, likely conservative given past underestimates and China’s 80% share of solar components. China and India led, with solar covering >80% of new demand in H1 2025. The U.S. and EU backslid (EU gas +14% on weak wind/hydro; U.S. coal +17%); IEA halved U.S. outlook. HN debates economics, geopolitics, and AI-driven load.

- Comment pulse
  - IEA underestimates US solar? → Past misses and rooftop economics may outrun policy cuts — counterpoint: IEA halved U.S. outlook after tax credits were scrapped.
  - Renewables win on cost → Fossil assets risk stranding; governments prop coal, but private capital picks faster-payback solar, storage, wind.
  - Data centers drive U.S. demand → AI/Internet growth boosts gas and keeps some coal running; commenters ask for quantified shares of load.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cost curves dominate; policy slows but doesn’t flip trajectory. Grid interconnection and permitting now pace deployment more than module supply.
  - Impact: Utilities and fossil owners face stranded-risk; data centers risk gas lock-in without long-term clean PPAs and storage/firming.
  - Watch next: U.S. interconnection queues, EU capacity rules, China panel glut absorption, storage/LFP price trends, standardized AI power metrics from grid operators.
