# Smartphones and being present

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45568613) | Link: https://herman.bearblog.dev/being-present/

- TL;DR
  - The author rejects recommendation-driven smartphone use to protect attention and presence. He disables YouTube watch history, blocks Shorts/recommendations with adblock selectors, deletes social accounts, and keeps only utilities and RSS—bringing use down to ~30 minutes/day. He argues time limits fail; the only winning move is not to play. HN commenters echo minimalist setups, lament hostile mobile sites that force apps, and describe short‑form infinite scroll as a slot‑machine dopamine loop; others share CSS/app patches to neuter engagement traps.

- Comment pulse
  - Minimalist smartphone setup → fewer distractions, more deep work; nuisance: mobile sites force app installs; request device-level "desktop mode" spoofing.
  - Kill recommendation engines → disable YouTube history, hide recs/shorts via CSS/adblock; developers patch apps to remove addictive UI — counterpoint: usability for legitimate browsing suffers.
  - Short-form + infinite scroll → slot-machine dopamine loop; harms attention; some report “immunity” but get hooked by text drama instead.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Design for friction beats willpower; remove triggers rather than limit time.
  - Impact: OS vendors, browsers, and platforms can curb engagement hacks; individuals gain hours and attention.
  - Watch next: iOS/Android “desktop mode,” global rec-history off switches, autoplay/infinite scroll defaults, independent audits of time-on-device metrics.
