# Show HN: SQLite Online – 11 years of solo development, 11K daily users

- Score: 328 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567770) | Link: https://sqliteonline.com/

- TL;DR
  - SQLite Online is a solo-built, in-browser SQL IDE/runtime (2014–2025) supporting SQLite (sqlite.org/wasm), plus DuckDB and PGLite. It offers import/export, virtual tables, OPFS/IndexedDB storage, charting via Q‑SELECT, history, and AI error hints. The project serves ~11K daily users but has “almost zero” paid subscribers. HN applauds its classroom and quick‑validation utility, mentions DuckDB‑WASM peers, and debates growth: keep the domain; prioritize clearer UX, runnable examples, better titles/SEO—while a few advocate a more descriptive domain.

- Comment pulse
  - Zero‑setup teaching aid → quick links let students practice queries before installing tooling, improving motivation in class.
  - Handy for ad‑hoc validation → users test joins and queries; peers build DuckDB WASM; multi‑database option praised.
  - Growth playbook → keep domain; fix UX, add runnable examples, better titles, and SEO indexing — counterpoint: a descriptive domain might aid understanding.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Browser SQL IDE proving WASM DBs and OPFS are practical; added charts and AI errors broaden use beyond CRUD.
  - Impact: Reduces setup friction for teaching and prototyping; multi‑DB support invites comparisons with DuckDB tools; monetization remains unclear.
  - Watch next: Native‑WASM performance vs sql.js, OPFS quota behavior, federated virtual tables robustness, and SEO growth via runnable example pages.
