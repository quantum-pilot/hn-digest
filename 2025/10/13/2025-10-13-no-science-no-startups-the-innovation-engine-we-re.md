# No Science, No Startups: The Innovation Engine We're Switching Off

- Score: 258 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567877) | Link: https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/

- TL;DR
  - Steve Blank argues the U.S. innovation engine relies on a pipeline: basic/applied science (mostly in research universities) → engineering → startups → VC. He explains scientists’ roles (theory vs experiments), contrasts them with engineers/entrepreneurs/VCs, and traces corporate labs’ decline since 1982 to financialized incentives. He warns 2025 federal cuts and tighter immigration will sap facilities and talent, slowing deep tech; AI boosts scientists but won't replace them. Weakening science funding weakens national power; countries investing (e.g., China) will capture future gains.

- Comment pulse
  - Buybacks/financialization → short-termism and fewer corporate basic labs; — counterpoint: big tech still researches, and classic labs often failed to commercialize.
  - University research → high quality but buried by red tape; users rarely benefit without commercialization; research needs capital, markets, and rule-of-law to matter.
  - Who captures value → Canada funded neural nets; U.S. monetized via bigger markets/VC; immigration headwinds could reverse talent flows.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Deep-tech pipeline is upstream-constrained; cutting basic science erodes future startups and defense edge.
  - Impact: Universities, immigrant researchers, and VC deep-tech theses; corporate R&D portfolios skew to near-term.
  - Watch next: FY26 appropriations, NSF/NIH paylines, visa policy shifts, corporate lab revivals, AI tools’ measured lab productivity gains.
