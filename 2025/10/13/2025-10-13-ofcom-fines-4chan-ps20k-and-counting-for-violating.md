# Ofcom fines 4chan £20K and counting for violating UK's Online Safety Act

- Score: 160 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45568767) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/

- TL;DR
  - Ofcom issued its first Online Safety Act fine, £20k to 4chan, plus £100/day up to £6k, for ignoring requests for child-safety risk assessments and revenue data. The regulator has 21 investigations underway; some sites avoided action by geoblocking UK users, and Ofcom is pushing hash-matching for CSAM. HN debates enforcement reach and strategy: 4chan can ignore UK or geoblock; Ofcom must act to keep credibility and may seek ISP blocking, raising concerns about de facto cross-border censorship.

- Comment pulse
  - Ofcom can't coerce a US site; 4chan can ignore or geoblock → enforcement is symbolic — counterpoint: Fine targets info-request noncompliance; geoblocking would have sufficed.
  - This makes 4chan a “think of the children” example → builds momentum for stronger powers like ISP blocking rather than direct bans.
  - Extraterritorial rules risk a lowest-common-denominator internet → platforms withdraw or over-comply to avoid multi-jurisdiction conflicts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Early stress test of the Online Safety Act; enforcement nudges sites toward geoblocking and automated CSAM controls.
  - Impact: Non-UK platforms weigh UK market vs. compliance cost; expect more exits, age checks, and vendor demand for hash-matching.
  - Watch next: Whether Ofcom gains ISP-blocking authority, levies larger fines, or sets precedent via successful appeals and cross-border enforcement.
