- TL;DR
  - The US Mint unveiled 2026 American Innovation $1 designs: Norman Borlaug (Iowa), Cray‑1 supercomputer (Wisconsin), Steve Jobs (California), and mobile refrigeration (Minnesota). The obverse keeps the Statue of Liberty and adds a “250” Liberty Bell privy for America’s Semiquincentennial. HN debated Jobs’ suitability given past labor-collusion findings, broader discomfort with putting flawed people—especially CEOs—on money, and whether inventions or engineers would be better honorees. Commenters praised the refrigeration coin and discussed cold-chain impact; others critiqued the Jobs portrait’s “spiritual” pose.

- Comment pulse
  - Humans don't belong on money → allegories avoid endless moral arguments; use symbols like Liberty or Providentia — counterpoint: honor net‑positive contributors while acknowledging flaws.
  - Pick inventions or engineers, not CEOs → question why Jobs over Apple II/iPhone; why Cray-1 not Seymour Cray; suggest Woz, Shannon, Knuth, Ritchie.
  - Cold chain deserves the spotlight → refrigerated trucking enabled food and pharma logistics; Minnesota origin surprised locals; many favored this coin’s design.
