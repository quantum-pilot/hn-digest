# Video game union workers rally against $55B private acquisition of EA

- Score: 303 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45606394) | Link: https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators

- TL;DR
    - EA’s unions (UVW-CWA) oppose a $55B take-private backed by Saudi Arabia’s PIF and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, petitioning regulators to scrutinize layoffs, creative control, and accountability. They argue EA is profitable ($7.5B revenue, ~$1B profit) and job cuts would be discretionary. Human Rights Watch flags PIF’s rights issues; FTC won’t comment; reports expect minimal resistance. HN debates LBOs shifting debt to targets and draining R&D, whether profitable-company layoffs are strategic or necessary post-overhiring, and how transferable game dev skills shape union power.

- Comment pulse
    - LBOs saddle EA with debt → cash shifts from R&D to servicing, pressuring layoffs — counterpoint: not a free-money glitch; lenders enforce cashflow discipline.
    - Layoffs at profitable firms can be rational → managers cite post‑COVID overhiring and low performers dragging teams.
    - Game dev skills seem transferable → but firm-specific tools, titles, and reputational signals impede exits; unions still provide bargaining ROI.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a classic private equity take-private: labor, roadmap, and live-service operations bear the debt risk, not investors.
    - Impact: If debt covenants bite, expect studio consolidation, fewer experimental titles, and prioritization of annualized sports/live-service cash cows.
    - Watch next: Regulatory signals: HSR filing progress, CFIUS review due to PIF, union neutrality agreements, and concrete headcount or project roadmap commitments.
