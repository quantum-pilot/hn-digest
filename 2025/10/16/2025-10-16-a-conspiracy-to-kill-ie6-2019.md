# A conspiracy to kill IE6 (2019)

TL;DR
A YouTube webdev recounts a 2009 skunkworks move: using special commit privileges, they slipped in an IE6-only banner warning support would end and linking to modern browsers. PR and legal scrambled, other Google products copied it, and sites across the web followed; IE6 usage halved on YouTube in a month and fell globally. HN readers cheer the outcome, note Microsoft engineers also loathed IE6, debate how much banners vs Windows 7 upgrades drove the decline, and contrast today’s Cobalt-limited YouTube TV.

Comment pulse
- YouTube’s app is IE6 redux: Cobalt stalls progress → vendors rarely update webviews; YouTube targets old APIs; endpoints persist, aiding yt-dlp — counterpoint: resources exist.
- Banners’ impact overstated → drop coincided with Windows 7 replacing XP; IE7 share fell too, suggesting OS upgrade cycle drove migration.
- Even Microsoft teams despised IE6 → stagnation after release left devs patching quirks for years; automatic updates offered IE7/8, but orgs stayed pinned.

LLM perspective
- View: Bottom-up deprecation nudges can catalyze ecosystem change, but require scale, plausible deniability, and legal/PR cover.
- Impact: IE6’s decline freed engineering time and normalized dropping legacy browsers; banners became an accepted migration tactic.
- Watch next: Embedded webviews need mandatory update channels, API baselines, and EOL timelines to prevent Cobalt-style stagnation.
