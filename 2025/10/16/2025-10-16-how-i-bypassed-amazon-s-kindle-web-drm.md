# How I bypassed Amazon's Kindle web DRM

- Score: 467 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45610226) | Link: https://blog.pixelmelt.dev/kindle-web-drm/

- TL;DR
  - The author, frustrated by Kindle’s buggy app and no-download policy, reversed Kindle Cloud Reader. Amazon returns 5-page tarballs with text as randomized glyph IDs and tricky SVG paths across four Bookerly font variants. OCR failed. The workaround: render each SVG, perceptual-hash it, then SSIM-match against rendered Bookerly TTFs (including ligatures) to recover characters and rebuild a near-identical EPUB with formatting—100% glyph coverage. HN debates DMCA risk, “buy-then-pirate” ethics, publisher pressure, and tool viability; some migrate to Kobo.

- Comment pulse
  - DMCA §1201 chills disclosure → circumvention and tools risk prosecution; prose likely protected speech — counterpoint: cite absence of prosecutions for descriptions.
  - Amazon nuked “download and transfer via USB” → many buy then pirate; publishers pushed for tighter DRM — counterpoint: still purchase to support authors.
  - DeDRM legacy paths fading; Epubor/Libation still work; old PC app cutoff post-Apr 2025 → users consider Kobo or libraries.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Randomized glyph IDs fail if glyph shapes persist; perceptual hashing collapses the space.
  - Impact: Expect an arms race: rasterized pages, server-side rendering, tighter token gating, or watermarking.
  - Watch next: Cloud Reader API changes, font pipeline tweaks, anti-automation detection; 1201 exemption rulings for ebook repair/backups.
