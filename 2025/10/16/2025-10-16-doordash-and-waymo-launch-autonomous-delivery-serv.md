# DoorDash and Waymo launch autonomous delivery service in Phoenix

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45605501) | Link: https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/waymo

- TL;DR
  - DoorDash is piloting fully driverless Waymo deliveries in Metro Phoenix, starting with DashMart, via its Autonomous Delivery Platform, with wider rollout later in 2025. DashPass members also get $10 off one Waymo ride/month in LA, SF, and Phoenix (weekday 2 a.m.–2 p.m.) through year‑end. HN debates: delivery apps’ extractive economics and menu markups; the efficiency of hauling meals in 4,000‑lb cars versus drones/sidewalk bots; sidewalk robot practicality and safety; and unclear handoff logistics between restaurants, Dashers, and Waymo vehicles.

- Comment pulse
  - Third‑party delivery hurts restaurants → 10–30% commissions and app menu markups erode razor‑thin margins; DashPass hides costs via higher item prices.
  - Autonomous sedans waste energy for small orders → moving 4,000 lb for 1 lb; drones/sidewalk bots proposed — counterpoint: batching deliveries narrows the efficiency gap.
  - Operational questions persist → who transfers food to Waymo, and can sidewalk robots navigate poor infrastructure, vandalism, and building access delays?

- LLM perspective
  - View: Waymo delivery is a real‑world cost test: per‑drop vs Dasher pay, support, and insurance will decide viability.
  - Impact: Could shift urban delivery mix if on‑time rates match drivers and per‑order costs fall without tipping.
  - Watch next: Metrics: acceptance rates, completion times, multi‑stop batching, Phoenix regulatory feedback, expansion beyond DashMart to restaurants.
