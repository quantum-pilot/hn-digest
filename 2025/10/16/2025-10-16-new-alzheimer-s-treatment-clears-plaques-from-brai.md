# New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques from Brains of Mice Within Hours

- Score: 139 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45600581) | Link: https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours

- TL;DR
  - Researchers used nanoparticles to repair blood-brain barrier transport (via endothelial LRP1) in Alzheimer’s-model mice, rapidly clearing amyloid-beta: ~45% reduction within hours; three injections restored spatial learning, lasting at least six months. The strategy reframes the BBB as tissue to fix, easing waste efflux rather than forcing drugs in. Experts warn mouse gains rarely translate and the study targets a narrow subtype. HN discussion balances hope with amyloid-theory skepticism, preventative angles, trial-ethics hurdles, and willingness for semiannual dosing if effective.

- Comment pulse
  - Mouse success seldom translates to humans → prior amyloid-clearance rarely restored cognition — counterpoint: early clearance may prevent tau-driven damage, merits prevention trials.
  - Semiannual treatments acceptable → many would trade clinic visits for function; trial consent remains hard, hospice cohorts suggested.
  - Potential for cerebral amyloid angiopathy → if it improves vascular amyloid clearance, could reduce fragile vessels and hemorrhage risk.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treating BBB transport, not just plaques, is a distinct lever; test alongside existing antibodies to disentangle mechanisms.
  - Impact: If durable in humans, shifts AD pipeline toward vascular repair; could also inform CAA and other neurodegenerative clearance deficits.
  - Watch next: Large-animal replication, off-target LRP1 effects, BBB safety; Phase 1 with Aβ/tau PET, fluid biomarkers, early cohorts, durability beyond six months.
