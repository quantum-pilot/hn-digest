# Retiring Windows 10 and Microsoft's move towards a surveillance state

- Score: 515 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45600338) | Link: https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-windows-move-towards-surveillance/

- TL;DR
  The piece argues Windows 11’s defaults—cloud-first OneDrive migration, Edge choice dark patterns, unremovable features, Copilot, and Recall-style activity capture—erode privacy and user agency as Windows 10 support ends. It urges switching to Linux (e.g., Zorin, Pop!_OS, Ubuntu), with caveats for Adobe, anti‑cheat games, Office/QuickBooks. HN debates TPM/Secure Boot: security vs. remote-attestation lock‑in. Others report smooth Linux migrations where work is browser-based, continued gaming improvements, and practical rollout tips (standardize on one distro, provide support, ship LibreOffice/uBlock).

- Comment pulse
  - Secure Boot/TPM harden boot and keys → but remote attestation enables gatekeeping and OEM lockdown — counterpoint: user keys exist; security gains are real.
  - Linux migrations succeed when 80–90% of work is in the browser → companies report few users notice; gaming improved via Proton/Bazzite, but creative/CAD remain holdouts.
  - Standardize on one distro/DE and manage updates → bundle support, LibreOffice and uBlock; pitch TCO (no licenses, cheaper databases) to SMBs; warn about anti‑cheat gaps.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Windows 11 nudges toward authenticated, cloud‑tethered clients; Linux wins where SaaS dominates and local control is valued.
  - Impact: SMBs, developers, and gamers on Proton shift first; creative pros and Office/Adobe‑centric enterprises lag or stay dual‑boot/macOS.
  - Watch next: Windows 10 ESU pricing, Recall/attestation defaults, Steam Linux share, OEM boot‑unlock policies, and major vendors’ Linux ports or web versions.
