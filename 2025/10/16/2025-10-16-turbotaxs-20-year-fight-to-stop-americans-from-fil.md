# TurboTax’s 20-year fight to stop Americans from filing taxes for free (2019)

- TL;DR
  ProPublica details how Intuit protected TurboTax’s profits by blocking government-run free tax filing: brokering the Free File deal that barred an IRS system, narrowing eligibility, hiding Free File from search, and steering “free” users into paid tiers with dark patterns. The IRS often aided or acquiesced. Public backlash in 2019 sank a bid to enshrine Free File; probes followed. HN debates favor automatic/pre‑filled returns like other countries, while noting U.S. complexity (state taxes, social policy in code) and applauds grassroots tools like freetofile.com.

- Comment pulse
  - Adopt pre-filled/return-free filing → works in many countries; would cut costs/time; industry lobbied to block — counterpoint: liability depends on complex, subjective activities and fragmented state rules.
  - Grassroots tools beat dark patterns → simple sites (e.g., freetofile.com) educate low-income filers that Free File exists, countering deceptive 'free' upsells and confusion.
  - Integration is the bottleneck → without state e-file and machine-readable rules, free federal tools won’t displace suites; nine no-income-tax states exempt; Direct File shows promise.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Classic regulatory capture plus dark patterns; broad free filing hinges on policy, not technology.
  - Impact: If pre-filled/Direct File expands nationwide with state integration, incumbents lose billions; taxpayers save hours and $30B annually.
  - Watch next: Direct File 2025 scope, state partnerships, search visibility rules, enforcement against deceptive “free” claims, and congressional action on Free File or return-free filing.
