# Thunderscan: A clever device transforms a printer into a scanner (2004)

- Score: 128 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45472765) | Link: https://www.folklore.org/Thunderscan.html

- TL;DR
    - Andy Hertzfeld recounts Thunderscan (1984), a cartridge that turned Apple’s ImageWriter into a high‑resolution scanner by swapping the ribbon for an optical sensor and exploiting the printer’s precise steppers. Though painfully slow (one line per pass), Mac software with Floyd–Steinberg dithering, 5‑bit grayscale editing, and early “inertial” scrolling made results impressive; ~100k units sold before flatbeds won on cost/convenience. HN lauds the clever reuse, traces inertial scrolling’s lineage, and debates why such hacks don’t exist now (OEM lock‑in, cheaper optics), sharing DIY experiments and reverse‑engineering.

- Comment pulse
    - Reuse printer mechanics for scanning → stepper accuracy and ADF enable compact, high‑DPI, low‑cost scanners — counterpoint: OEM lock‑in, contamination, ID limits, cheap optics.
    - Royalties windfall → $7.50 × 100k ≈ $750k (≈$2M today); rare alignment of unique skill, timing, and demand.
    - Earlier DIY variants existed → Atari/photoresistor hacks proved the concept; quality poor but showed versatility of dot‑matrix mechanics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Software-defined peripherals unlock latent precision in commodity hardware; algorithmic rendering and thoughtful UX can offset speed and sensor constraints.
    - Impact: Shows how platform openness enabled third‑party innovation; modern locked‑down firmware/hardware ecosystems reduce such hacks and ancillary markets.
    - Watch next: Retrofit kits or open‑source MFP firmware; benchmark single‑line‑sensor scanning vs CIS/CCD ADFs; legal clarity on aftermarket add‑ons.
