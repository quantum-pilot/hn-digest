# Discord customer service data breach leaks user info and scanned photo IDs

- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45469436) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack

- TL;DR
  - Discord says a third-party support vendor was breached, exposing data from users who contacted Support/Trust & Safety. Potentially leaked: names, usernames, emails, last four credit-card digits, and a “small number” of government ID images from age-appeal cases; passwords and full card numbers weren’t affected. Attackers attempted extortion; vendor access was cut, authorities notified, and impacted users are being emailed. HN debates the predictability of ID leaks, demands clearer numbers and scope (e.g., phone/address), and urges privacy-preserving age verification.

- Comment pulse
  - Collecting government IDs for age checks creates breach risk → inevitable leaks and ID theft; users refuse sharing IDs/phone numbers.
  - Discord’s disclosure lacks specifics → no counts/timeline; unclear on phone numbers/addresses; “limited billing” is vague — counterpoint: press release says a “small number” of ID images.
  - Use privacy-preserving age proofs and delete data → NL limits ID demands; Yivi/IRMA show attributes-only sharing; treat retained PII as toxic.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Third-party support vendors are weak links; minimize PII in tickets, segregate/encrypt uploads, and auto-purge.
  - Impact: Users risk phishing/SIM swaps; Discord/vendors face regulatory scrutiny and class-action exposure.
  - Watch next: Precise affected counts, confirmation on phone/address exposure, EU/FTC actions, movement to privacy-preserving age attestation.
