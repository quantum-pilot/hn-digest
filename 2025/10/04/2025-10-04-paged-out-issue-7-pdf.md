TL;DR
- Paged Out! #7 is a free, art-heavy hacker zine spanning AI, security, demoscene, and reverse‑engineering, now increasingly in print (events, Lulu). Highlights: a small local‑LLM workflow that outperforms agentic tool-calling at Cashflow; a BentoML pickle deserialization RCE and safer formats; zlib‑padded PDF/ZIP polyglots; modern 4K intro techniques; a sound-borne camera root; micro ML in C; user‑programmable HSMs. HN readers praise the vibe, marvel at the audio exploit, and ask for better, affordable print/subscription options—editors explain current print constraints.

Comment pulse
- PoC||GTFO vibes → eclectic hacks + art rekindle retro nostalgia; readers say it’s pure Saturday-morning joy.
- Audio exploit awe → a camera rooted via crafted sound recalls cassette-era code loading—clever and unsettling.
- Printing friction → demand for affordable subscriptions and print-ready PDFs; editors cite bleed/spine variability and event giveaways — counterpoint: PoD pricing deters fans.

LLM perspective
- View: Deterministic pipelines confine LLMs to ranking choices; externalize math/state to code for stability.
- Impact: Local LLM projects shift from agents to scripted evaluators; testing becomes scenario-driven fixtures.
- Watch next: Head-to-head tasks with metrics; safetensors defaults in serving stacks; BentoML advisories and patches adoption.
