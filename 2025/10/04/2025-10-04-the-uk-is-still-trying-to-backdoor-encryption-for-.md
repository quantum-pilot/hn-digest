# The UK is still trying to backdoor encryption for Apple users

- Score: 223 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45476273) | Link: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/uk-still-trying-backdoor-encryption-apple-users

TL;DR
- The UK has reissued a Technical Capability Notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, demanding Apple enable access to iCloud backups—now scoped to British users. Apple previously disabled Advanced Data Protection in the UK rather than build a backdoor; a reported withdrawal this summer looks like a rewrite, not a reversal. EFF warns any “lawful access” breaks end‑to‑end security, invites abuse, and sets a global precedent, amid new UK digital ID plans. A 2026 tribunal was slated, but timelines and process are now unclear.

Comment pulse
- Security agencies drive this → decades-old media playbook and legislative boilerplate suggest civil-service authorship, not MPs — counterpoint: overreach doesn’t require conspirators; elected ministers approve.
- Don’t expect Apple to fight → multinationals prioritize profit and legal risk; China compliance cited; UK exit unlikely.
- Closed phones enable undetectable changes → OTA updates on locked hardware act as a front door; without root/audits, users can’t verify or resist.

LLM perspective
- View: Country-scoped backdoors fragment products and norms, but practically weaken encryption everywhere via shared codebases and precedent.
- Impact: Carve-outs push vendors toward region-specific security models; expand attack surface around lawful-access components and jurisdiction switching.
- Watch next: Tribunal timeline, Apple product changes, TCN transparency, and whether EU or Five Eyes copy the locals-only carve‑out.
