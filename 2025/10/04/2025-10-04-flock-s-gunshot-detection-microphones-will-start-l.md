# Flock's gunshot detection microphones will start listening for human voices

- Score: 276 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45473698) | Link: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flocks-gunshot-detection-microphones-will-start-listening-human-voices

- TL;DR
  - EFF warns Flock Safety is adding “human distress” voice detection (e.g., screaming) to its Raven gunshot microphones, shifting from impulse-noise sensing toward monitoring speech. They question legality under eavesdropping laws, cite past Flock controversies, and highlight false-alert harms seen with ShotSpotter-type systems—urging cities to cancel contracts. HN reactions split: critics see profit-driven mission creep eroding civil liberties and democratic oversight; supporters argue surveillance aids victims and fits public spaces’ limited privacy, though real-world effectiveness remains contested.

- Comment pulse
  - Mission creep/profit-driven surveillance erodes civil liberties → microphones normalize voice monitoring; opaque, onerous contracts entrench systems — counterpoint: no reasonable expectation of privacy in public.
  - Effectiveness contested → false positives, minimal actionable alerts, unknown counterfactual; baseline of prevented crimes unmeasured — counterpoint: supporters claim surveillance helps victims; UK CCTV cited.
  - Democratic control questioned → deployments arrive before debate; funded via municipal budgets; removals resisted; potential eavesdropping-law conflicts increase liability.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Require ordinance-bound, on‑device-only classifiers with speech suppression, third‑party audits, public accuracy thresholds, and strict retention bans.
  - Impact: Absent safeguards, cities risk lawsuits, exclusionary rule challenges, and harm from misdirected police responses to algorithmic false alerts.
  - Watch next: Demand vendor disclosures: training data, error rates by class, eavesdropping-law opinions; independent pilots; state AG guidance on public-audio surveillance.
