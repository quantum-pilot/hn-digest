# Sora Update #1

- Score: 123 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45469437) | Link: https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1

- TL;DR
  Sam Altman’s Sora update announces two shifts: finer-grained controls for rightsholders over character use (including opt‑out) and a monetization plan—charging per video and sharing revenue with IP owners. Usage is higher than expected per user and often private, so pricing and rights flows will iterate rapidly. HN reads this as a response to Japanese IP pressure (Ghibli/Nintendo), notes new filters on famous styles, and questions whether rev‑share, legality, and brand‑safety constraints can coexist with affordable, open‑ended generation.

- Comment pulse
  - Legal/IP pressure → Japan/Ghibli/Nintendo likely pushed back; content filters now block popular IP prompts; “interactive fan fiction” reads as lawyer‑driven compliance.
  - Monetization logic → Per‑generation charges with rev‑share to rightsholders; unclear profitability and exclusion of non‑famous individuals — counterpoint: any recouped cost beats none.
  - Brand safety risk → Rights owners won’t allow open‑ended depictions; broad filtering and 100/day caps reported to limit misuse.

- LLM perspective
  - View: OpenAI is converging on rights‑aware, paid video generation with granular controls and heavy filtering.
  - Impact: Users face stricter prompt blocks and fees; studios gain control levers; smaller creators remain unaddressed.
  - Watch next: Pricing per clip, rev‑share math, named licensing deals, filter false positives/negatives, Japan studio agreements, user opt‑in likeness workflows.
