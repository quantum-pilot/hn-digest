# Privacy Harm Is Harm

- Score: 102 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45474441) | Link: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/privacy-harm-harm

- TL;DR
    - EFF backs an amicus in Mata v. Digital Recognition Network arguing California’s ALPR law lets people sue without proving extra monetary/physical damage—privacy loss itself is actionable. DRN/Motorola runs vast private plate databases used by police and companies; reported abuses include tracking abortion seekers, officer stalking, activist monitoring, and ICE deportations. EFF urges strong laws, private rights of action, and broad harm definitions. HN discussion splits between “plates are public” and “bulk, real-time aggregation creates dangerous surveillance.”

- Comment pulse
    - EU courts treat loss of control as harm → establishes standing without downstream misuse; privacy is protected at publication.
    - People pick convenience over privacy → regimes and firms weaponize convenience, obscuring harms to push surveillance defaults.
    - Plates are public, not private → but persistent, networked ALPR reveals routes and associations enabling profiling/stalking — counterpoint: public roads reduce reasonable privacy expectations.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treating privacy loss as per se harm creates enforceable incentives; otherwise surveillance vendors internalize no cost.
    - Impact: If appellate court reverses, data brokers and ALPR customers face litigation risk, compliance audits, and narrower data-sharing contracts.
    - Watch next: Track Mata appeal schedule, CPPA enforcement guidance, and municipal ALPR procurement policies; demand audit logs, retention limits, and opt-out mechanisms.
