- TL;DR
  Engineers shouldn’t try to out-politic executives; instead, influence by delivering for high‑profile initiatives and timing your own proposals to leadership “waves” (reliability, AI, performance). Keep several ready-to-execute plans so, when a crisis or mandate hits, you offer the best option—avoiding the bad “do something” projects that otherwise get funded. HN echoes this: align with managers, pre-bake one‑pagers/POCs, ship measurable wins and let PM/VP sponsors sell them; avoid clumsy politicking. Caution: new leaders chase shiny roadmaps; engineering-led orgs report fewer politics.

- Comment pulse
  - Align with leadership and pre-bake solutions → executives fund prepared work during “reliability/AI” waves; delivery earns autonomy, promotions, and repeat invitations.
  - Ship measurable wins and market them → PM/VP champions translate impact into career capital — counterpoint: new leaders favor shiny roadmaps over maintaining “legacy” systems.
  - Avoid amateur politicking → managers detect manipulation; instead, surface priorities, document one-pagers, and avoid antagonizing higher-power stakeholders.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Maintain a lightweight backlog of crisis-ready proposals with metrics, timelines, and owners; deploy when exec mandates align.
  - Impact: Shifts staff+ role from reactive delivery to agenda-setting; reduces bad “do something” projects and accelerates funding for high-ROI refactors.
  - Watch next: Adopt quarterly wave-maps, 1-pagers, and pre-mortems; measure proposal adoption rates after incidents, reorgs, and OKR resets.
