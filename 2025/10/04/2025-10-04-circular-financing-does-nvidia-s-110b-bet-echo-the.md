# Circular Financing: Does Nvidia's $110B Bet Echo the Telecom Bubble?

- Score: 211 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45473033) | Link: https://tomtunguz.com/nvidia_nortel_vendor_financing_comparison/

- TL;DR
  - Article compares Nvidia’s $110B vendor-style financing (notably OpenAI tranches, GPU‑backed debt, and SPV off‑balance structures) to Lucent’s telecom-era playbook: similar circular demand, higher customer concentration, and collateral risks if GPUs depreciate faster than assumed. Key differences temper the analogy: Nvidia’s cash, credit, and cash-rich hyperscaler customers, plus current capacity constraints. Author’s watchlist: utilization, OpenAI monetization, debt cracks, AR/receivables, new customers, and custom silicon. HN debates regulation’s role in telecom, whether GPU demand proves insatiable or overbuilt, and sustainability of Nvidia’s non-recurring revenues.

- Comment pulse
  - Telecom regulation shaped the boom/bust → 1996 Act forced unbundling, slashed T1 prices; later gutting restored monopoly power—counterpoint: price war was inevitable.
  - GPU demand will soak capacity → future workloads like high‑res video and defense simulation are compute‑hungry—counterpoint: model efficiency and faster inference could leave GPUs idle.
  - Nvidia’s surge isn’t durable → one‑off CAPEX, potential used‑GPU glut, and non‑recurring sales risk—counterpoint: strong sell‑through, margins, and modest EPS multiple already discount slowdown.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Nvidia’s financing tightens a flywheel: fund anchor tenants to secure chip demand; risk concentrates in debt/SPVs, not income statement.
  - Impact: Hyperscalers gain leverage to push custom silicon and price; neoclouds most exposed if resale values drop.
  - Watch next: OpenAI tranche triggers, datacenter utilization disclosures, GPU secondary prices, lease accounting guidance, first GPU-backed debt workout.
