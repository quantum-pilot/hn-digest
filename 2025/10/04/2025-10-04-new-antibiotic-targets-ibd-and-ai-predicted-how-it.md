# New antibiotic targets IBD and AI predicted how it would work

- Score: 195 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45469579) | Link: https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/new-antibiotic-targets-ibd-and-ai-predicted-how-it-would-work-before-scientists-could-prove-it/

- TL;DR
    - McMaster/MIT report enterololin, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that targets Enterobacteriaceae overgrowth implicated in IBD flares while sparing the broader microbiome. Using MIT’s DiffDock, they predicted its mechanism (LolCDE lipoprotein transporter inhibition) in ~100 seconds, then validated experimentally, shrinking mechanism-of-action work from ~2 years/$2M to 6 months/$60k. Early results are preclinical; Stoked Bio is optimizing for trials within ~3 years. HN discussion praises AI’s role in triage, clarifies this isn’t an IBD cure, notes prior LolCDE inhibitors (e.g., globomycin), and distinguishes docking models from LLMs.

- Comment pulse
    - AI-guided MOA triages experiments → DiffDock flagged LolCDE in seconds, focusing validation and reducing exploratory wet-lab cycles — counterpoint: LolCDE inhibition is decades-old; novelty questioned.
    - Not an IBD cure → Aimed at decolonizing Enterobacter blooms (often post–broad-spectrum antibiotics); may help rebalance microbiota; evidence is mouse-only.
    - IBD etiology is multifactorial → Enterobacteriaceae blooms exploit inflammation and worsen it; broad-spectrum antibiotics can exacerbate dysbiosis, motivating narrow-spectrum approaches.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Structure-based models can rapidly prioritize MOA hypotheses, reallocating wet-lab effort to the most testable, high-yield mechanisms.
    - Impact: Shorter, cheaper MOA programs expand small-lab/biotech reach; regulators and investors will expect rigorous, standardized AI-to-wet validation pipelines.
    - Watch next: Prospective MOA benchmarks vs controls; off-target and resistance studies for LolCDE inhibitors; microbiome outcomes; first-in-human timelines.
