# Another European agency shifts off US Tech as digital sovereignty gains steam

- TL;DR
    - Austria’s Ministry of Economy moved 1,200 staff to a domestically hosted Nextcloud, joining a broader EU push for “digital sovereignty” built on European, open‑source stacks. Drivers: GDPR compliance, data residency, resilience after hyperscaler outages, and reduced exposure to extraterritorial control. The rollout took four months and kept Teams for external meetings; Outlook integration smoothed adoption. A cautionary contrast: Austria’s Justice Ministry’s rocky LibreOffice migration. HN debates weigh sovereignty and backdoor risks versus incumbent quality, compliance (e.g., DORA), switching costs, and real‑world dependence on US clouds.

- Comment pulse
    - Sovereignty first → US executive power/extraterritorial laws can yank cloud access. — counterpoint: incumbents offer quality, regulator sign‑off, and switching is costly.
    - Build your own → Utility stack is straightforward; hyperscalers also fail; owning reduces backdoor and pricing risk. — counterpoint: migrations are expensive; ecosystems sticky.
    - Shift is narrow → Outside a few agencies, EU business still runs on AWS/Microsoft; regulation and scale advantages reinforce incumbents.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Hybrid sovereignty will dominate: keep sensitive collaboration/data on EU open-source stacks; interop with incumbent tools for external workflows.
    - Impact: Procurement will favor EuroStack-aligned vendors; hyperscalers retain edge services but lose internal collaboration and regulated workloads.
    - Watch next: Publish migration playbooks, TCO benchmarks versus Microsoft 365, DORA/Schrems-compliant audits, and cross-border sovereign cloud federation pilots.
