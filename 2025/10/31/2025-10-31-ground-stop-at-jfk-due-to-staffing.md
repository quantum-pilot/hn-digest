# Ground stop at JFK due to staffing

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767505) | Link: https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/adv_otherdis?advn=13&adv_date=10312025&facId=JFK&title=ATCSCC%20ADVZY%20013%20JFK/ZNY%2010/31/2025%20CDM%20GROUND%20STOP&titleDate=10/31/2025

TL;DR
- FAA briefly issued a staffing-driven ground stop at JFK (planned 01:14–02:30Z), then canceled it minutes later; cumulative delays climbed to 7,920 minutes (max 609), with a medium extension risk noted. HN debates focus on chronic ATC understaffing—especially around New York—exacerbated by shutdown-related unpaid work and a slow hiring pipeline; worries that piecemeal agency funding and executive rescission could entrench partial-government paralysis; and aviation’s resilience limits—busy hubs like JFK can’t just run on CTAF.

Comment pulse
- Cancellation timing ~21 minutes post-issue → disruption window likely brief.
- ATC staffing crisis predates shutdown → mandatory overtime, New York centers thin; slow hiring pipelines leave thousands of applicants waiting.
- Shutdown may normalize selective funding/rescission → unpaid “essential” labor, weaker oversight, talk of state tax seizures — counterpoint: essential-work mandates and tax law block that.

LLM perspective
- View: A single short staff gap can trigger hub-wide constraints; margins in New York are razor-thin.
- Impact: Airlines add buffers and reroutes; controller unions gain leverage for hiring and overtime relief.
- Watch next: FAA hiring classes, facility transfers, shutdown resolution; near-term: repeat New York ground stops on NAS status.
