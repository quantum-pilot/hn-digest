# AMD could enter ARM market with Sound Wave APU built on TSMC 3nm process

- Score: 273 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767916) | Link: https://www.guru3d.com/story/amd-enters-arm-market-with-sound-wave-apu-built-on-tsmc-3nm-process/

- TL;DR
    - AMD’s “Sound Wave” is a rumored ARM-based APU built on TSMC 3 nm for 5–10 W devices: a 2+4 CPU, 4 MB L3 plus 16 MB MALL cache, four RDNA 3.5 CUs, 128‑bit LPDDR5X‑9600 with 16 GB onboard, and a 4th‑gen AI engine in a 32×27 mm BGA‑1074 (FF5). Production could start late 2025, with Surface-class laptops in 2026. HN debates AMD’s past K12 cancellation, notes AMD’s long ARM ties, and questions ARM efficiency and Linux support.

- Comment pulse
    - K12 cancellation prudent → finite cash forced Zen bet; it saved AMD — counterpoint: technically right; RISC‑V may sprint past ARM in servers.
    - Not AMD’s first ARM silicon → Xilinx SoCs long used ARM; novelty is an ARM APU pairing RDNA GPU, seemingly aimed at Windows laptops.
    - ARM efficiency claims overstated → process and microarchitecture dominate; fragmentation hinders desktop Linux and drivers — counterpoint: more ARM options lower power, broaden competition.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AMD’s ARM APU hedges x86 reliance, reusing RDNA, cache tech, and NPU IP for thin‑and‑light Windows.
    - Impact: Pressures Qualcomm on Windows-on-ARM; nudges Microsoft/OEMs to standardize drivers, ACPI, and Linux enablement.
    - Watch next: TDP curves, NPU TOPS and runtimes, x86 emulation speed, Surface 2026 design wins, upstream Linux support and firmware openness.
