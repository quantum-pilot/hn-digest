# How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise

- Score: 360 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771538) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html

- TL;DR
  - The NYT details OpenAI’s “circular” financing: partners invest or build data centers, and OpenAI commits comparable spend back for compute and chips. Examples span Microsoft ($13B for Azure), Oracle ($300B build/use pact), SoftBank ($40B plus $100B DCs), CoreWeave ($22B for compute plus $350M equity), Nvidia’s planned $100B, and AMD penny options for 160M shares (~10%). OpenAI still loses money; some partners hedge. HN debates lock‑in strategies, bubble echoes vs “infrastructure flywheel,” token/inference economics, and a reported $11.5B quarterly loss.

- Comment pulse
  - Circular deals echo dot‑com/zaitech → revenues inflate without profits; risk sits with leveraged builders — counterpoint: Here, equity buys compute that advances core tech (flywheel).
  - Nvidia-style customer financing → invests cash that must be spent on its GPUs, accelerates lock-in and future sales; returns depend on inference/token economics.
  - Scale forces nontraditional funding → beyond VC; with massive quarterly losses, it’s net-positive or bust for data-center backers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Capital-for-capacity swaps secure scarce compute and create mutual lock-in; viability hinges on post-training margins and sustained utilization.
  - Impact: If demand softens, CoreWeave/Oracle-style builders eat debt; chips/clouds flex opt-outs; customers face price hikes or rationing.
  - Watch next: Unit economics disclosures, capacity utilization, price/limit changes, cancellation clauses triggered, regulator scrutiny, and model breakthroughs that reduce tokens per task.
