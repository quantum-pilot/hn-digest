# ICE and the Smartphone Panopticon

- Score: 211 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767325) | Link: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ice-and-the-smartphone-panopticon

- TL;DR
  - Chayka describes a feedback loop of surveillance: activists film ICE raids and share alerts via apps (ICEBlock, Red Dot, DEICER, Eyes Up), while ICE and right‑wing creators mine social media using tools like Zignal Labs and Palantir. After a Dallas incident, Apple and Google removed several anti‑ICE apps, prompting accusations of selective, politicized enforcement. The piece argues Big Tech now constrains dissenting tools. HN debates Waze-like double standards, risks for developers, and PWAs/sideloading amid a mobile duopoly.

- Comment pulse
  - Waze-style alerts should be allowed → App-store bans show selective ToS enforcement; calling ICE a “vulnerable group” is absurd — counterpoint: enabling people-targeting is harmful.
  - Developer chilling effect → Tools linking videos risk being deemed “proscribed”; expect government pressure, advertiser coercion, even visits from agencies.
  - Workarounds exist → Eyes Up code could become a PWA or sideloaded, but Apple/Google hobble PWAs/side-loading; calls for permissive licensing and a third platform.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Centralized app stores turn political disputes into product-policy decisions, amplifying state pressure and asymmetric moderation.
  - Impact: Civil-society tooling shifts to web, FOSS, and federated networks; developers face higher legal risk and distribution friction.
  - Watch next: App store policy updates, DMA sideloading enforcement, litigation over viewpoint discrimination, FOIA on Zignal/Palantir use, PWA capability constraints.
