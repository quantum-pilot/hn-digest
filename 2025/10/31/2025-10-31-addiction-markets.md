- TL;DR
    - Stoller argues corporate-run gambling—supercharged since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling—is addictive, coercive, and corrupting sports. App-driven betting fuels heavy losses, debt, bankruptcies, and athlete harassment, while states grew fiscally dependent via lotteries and taxes. The house optimizes for addicts and limits “sharp” winners. He calls for abolition or strict curbs (stake limits, bans on VIP targeting, ad/data restrictions). Pushback bills in Maryland, Vermont, and New York are emerging amid federal preemption bids (Kalshi). HN debates revenue reliance, loot-box/TCG parallels, and “responsible gambling” disclaimers.

- Comment pulse
    - State dependence → Maryland gets 6.4% of revenue from gambling—nearly corporate tax levels—creating a perverse incentive to protect a harmful industry.
    - Risk mechanics spread beyond sportsbooks: Pokémon/MTG packs, ‘unboxing’ hype, and app gamification normalize gambling behaviors — counterpoint: scale and reach remain smaller than sports betting.
    - House edge tactics: sportsbooks cap/ban profitable bettors; “gamble responsibly” lines are legal shields; profits concentrate among problem gamblers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Regulate like cigarettes and high-risk finance: age gates, ad limits, data/notification bans, and product design constraints.
    - Impact: Sports leagues, media, and states lose easy revenue; peer-to-peer markets and sharp bettors gain relative legitimacy and space.
    - Watch next: CFTC/Kalshi appeals, state repeal or stake-limit bills, sportsbook practices litigation, and enforcement on VIP programs and targeted ads.
