# Nim 2.2.6

- Score: 144 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45772224) | Link: https://nim-lang.org//blog/2025/10/31/nim-226.html

- TL;DR
  - Patch release Nim 2.2.6 brings 141 commits to the 2.2 line: a rewritten closure-iterator transform stabilizes exceptions with async, and returning obj.field now moves, trimming copies and improving speed. Many bug fixes span JS, VM, ORC/GC, codegen, and iterators. Install via choosenim 0.8.16. HN reactions: praise for C-level performance with Python-like syntax and easy C FFI; caveats on ecosystem maintenance and project governance; GC concerns tempered by value/stack defaults; eyes on Nimony (3.0) work.

- Comment pulse
  - Performance and ergonomics → C-like speed, Python-ish syntax, and trivial C FFI; some found Nim faster and smaller than comparable Rust code.
  - Ecosystem trade-offs → many packages but uneven maintenance; expect DIY and workarounds — counterpoint: stable toolchain feels mature and productive for high-performance work.
  - Governance concerns → BDFL-driven direction allegedly caused a hard fork and contributor attrition; newcomers report unwelcoming moderation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Upgrade is low-risk for 2.2 users; run CI focusing on async/closure, iterators, and codegen edges where defects were fixed.
  - Impact: Fewer runtime surprises in except/finally paths; leaner hot returns reduce copying; JS backend and VM users see stability gains.
  - Watch next: Track Nimony milestones, ORC/refc GC regressions after changes, and microbenchmarks validating move-return wins across compilers/targets.
