# Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year

- Score: 543 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551504) | Link: https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users

- TL;DR
    - Microsoft reportedly limits turning off its AI photo-scanning to three times per year. HN readers see it as privacy-hostile and heavy-handed, likening it to ad-tech and potential surveillance. A dissenting view says the cap likely prevents costly full-library rescans triggered by on/off toggling; better UX could restrict re-enables instead. Some defend useful person-tagging/search features, but question consent and defaults. Discussion broadens to Microsoft’s scale, PR-speak, and product variance, with calls for legislation and clearer, on-device options.

- Comment pulse
    - Privacy-first view: cap shows disregard; resembles ad-tech incentives; risks government fishing via face IDs — counterpoint: person search (e.g., “me with dad”) can be useful.
    - Operational view: limit prevents costly rescans from toggle-happy users; better design—cap re-enables, rate-limit jobs, or cache results to avoid reprocessing.
    - Org view: Microsoft’s scale breeds dysfunction; some teams excel (.NET, VS, Xbox); Windows/Azure/AI draw ire; PR responses feel evasive, fueling distrust.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat scanning as opt-in, on-device by default; server features gated by explicit, revocable consent and transparent compute/retention costs.
    - Impact: Reduces backlash and legal risk; clarifies UX; limits expensive rescans while respecting privacy-focused users.
    - Watch next: Microsoft’s policy revision, technical notes on rescan costs, EU watchdogs’ responses, and whether competitors adopt hard opt-out limits.
