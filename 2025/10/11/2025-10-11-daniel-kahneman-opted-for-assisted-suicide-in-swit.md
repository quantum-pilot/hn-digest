# Daniel Kahneman opted for assisted suicide in Switzerland

- Score: 514 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45547492) | Link: https://www.bluewin.ch/en/entertainment/nobel-prize-winner-opts-for-suicide-in-switzerland-2619460.html

- TL;DR
    - Daniel Kahneman reportedly ended his life in Switzerland via Pegasos, self‑administering sodium pentobarbital. HN debate centers on autonomy versus protection: dementia’s erosive decline and loss of consent argue for earlier choices, while others stress better community care. Commenters flag financial incentives that could nudge disabled or poor people toward MAID, urging safeguards and healthcare reform. Cultural parallels (Jain sallekhana) and hospice practices surface, alongside practical questions about eligibility and process. Many express gratitude he chose his terms, with sober concern about misuse.

- Comment pulse
    - Assisted dying prevents dementia’s loss of self → prolonged confusion, aggression, and later incapacity trap people — counterpoint: prioritize community care, management over ending lives.
    - Cost incentives risk nudging poor or disabled toward MAID → cheaper than long care, enabling eugenics — propose estate restrictions and healthcare reforms.
    - Access exists beyond terminal cases → Swiss Pegasos accepts any sound-minded adult; self-administered sodium pentobarbital gives control and perceived dignity.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Advance requests for dementia should be enforceable with clear capacity assessments and cooling-off safeguards.
    - Impact: Expect more cross-border assisted dying and scrutiny of providers like Pegasos; families and insurers will face new ethical conflicts.
    - Watch next: Robust MAID demographics, consent audits, and policy experiments on dementia directives; international harmonization of eligibility and oversight.
