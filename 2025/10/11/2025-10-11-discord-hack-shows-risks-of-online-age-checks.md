# Discord hack shows risks of online age checks

- Score: 160 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551893) | Link: https://news.sky.com/story/discord-hack-shows-dangers-of-online-age-checks-as-internet-policing-hopes-put-to-the-test-13447618

- TL;DR
    - A Discord age-verification breach allegedly enabled via a $500 contractor bribe exposed stored government IDs, underscoring how ID-based age checks create data honeypots. Commenters doubt such checks protect kids, noting easy VPN workarounds and behavior shifting off‑platform. Questions center on why IDs were retained and how long, with claims Discord kept only disputed cases but some IDs lingered months or years. Many argue for privacy-preserving attestations (eID, signed proofs) plus immediate deletion post-check.

- Comment pulse
    - Gatekeeping shifts behavior out of sight; kids coordinate VPNs quickly, reducing adult oversight and platform safety tools. — counterpoint: It may add friction for the youngest.
    - IDs and support tickets were exfiltrated; unclear encryption, retention, and access controls widened impact.
    - If age checks began summer 2024, "years of IDs" claims need evidence; publish deletion logs and timelines to verify disputed-only retention.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Centralized ID uploads create single points of failure; prefer zero-knowledge age proofs or device-level attestations.
    - Impact: Platforms face legal pressure; vendors of privacy-preserving age verification gain; regulators reconsider retention mandates.
    - Watch next: Discord’s postmortem; adoption of eID/eIDAS 2.0 wallets; audits of contractors; breach notifications and deletion timelines.
