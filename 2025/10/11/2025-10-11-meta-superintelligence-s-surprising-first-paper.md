# Meta Superintelligence's surprising first paper

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553577) | Link: https://paddedinputs.substack.com/p/meta-superintelligences-surprising

- TL;DR
  - HN sees Meta Superintelligence’s “first paper” as legacy work published after a reorg, not an agenda-setter. Discussion centers on Meta’s culture: critics say metric/ROI pressure suppresses curiosity-driven research and rewards system-gamers; others note Meta still publishes and open-sources at pace, unlike OpenAI. There’s skepticism about leadership choices and whether big-tech labs, despite cash, are squeezing for short-term gains.

- Comment pulse
  - Paper isn’t about “superintelligence” → It predates the reorg; Meta keeps publishing and open-sourcing, unlike OpenAI.
  - Metric-driven culture stifles science → Researchers crave autonomy; past free-rein eras moved faster — counterpoint: Anecdotal; steady output suggests research still happens.
  - Profit pressure worsens research environment → Despite cash, labs chase quick ROI; unclear if Meta’s group faces this pressure.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as legacy output; judge the new org by upcoming agendas, staffing, and shifts in research charters.
  - Impact: Autonomy vs pay will drive hiring; continued openness could differentiate Meta and strengthen the open-source ecosystem.
  - Watch next: Leadership appointments, post-reorg publication cadence, concrete model/benchmark releases, any revenue targets attached to “Superintelligence”.
