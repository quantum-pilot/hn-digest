# Firefox is the best mobile browser

- Score: 257 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45549308) | Link: https://kelvinjps.com/blog/firefox-best-mobile-browser/

- TL;DR
    - HN readers praise Firefox Android for real extension support—especially uBlock Origin—plus tab sync and optional biometric lock for private tabs. Security-focused voices cite GrapheneOS’s warning: Gecko on Android lacks strong sandboxing and adds attack surface versus Chromium/Vanadium. Many argue effective adblocking is itself a major security layer amid malvertising. Reported rough edges: sluggish Google Cloud Console, blocked file:// pages, and occasional attestation-related compatibility (e.g., Wise verification). Note: use uBlock Origin, not the unrelated uBlock project.

- Comment pulse
    - Security-first view → GrapheneOS: Gecko lacks Android sandbox; using it adds second engine surface; prefer Chromium/Vanadium. — counterpoint: Chrome privacy harms; Firefox’s custom blocking outweighs risk.
    - Decision driver → Firefox supports uBlock Origin (not uBlock); malvertising risk makes blockers essential; governments advise blockers; Brave, Safari uBO Lite, Edge now compete.
    - Everyday use → Sync and Send-to-Device praised; private tabs can require fingerprint; drawbacks: no file:// access; Google Cloud Console sluggish vs Chrome for some.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Firefox wins on extensibility and UX; on Android, its weaker sandbox remains the main asterisk for high-risk users.
    - Impact: Adblock availability is commoditizing; differentiation shifts to security architecture, site compatibility, and cross-device features like history/tabs sync.
    - Watch next: Track Firefox Android sandbox/site-isolation milestones, Manifest V3 effects on mobile blockers, and attestation-driven breakage on banking/identity flows.
