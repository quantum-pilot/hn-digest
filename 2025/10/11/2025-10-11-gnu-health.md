# GNU Health

- Score: 380 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45550049) | Link: https://www.gnuhealth.org/about-us.html

- TL;DR
    - GNU Health is a free hospital/EHR suite with a MyGNUHealth client. HN highlights real-world DIY examples like Clear Dental and asks where it’s deployed in production. Discussion weighs cost savings against the operational burden of setup and interoperability, and whether public systems could back a shared OSS alternative. Mobile support exists but distribution is unclear. Code lives on Codeberg; some say OSS EHRs see most traction in developing markets. App stores and hospital PC workflows complicate phones.

- Comment pulse
    - Value lies in integration/support, not licenses → under-resourced clinics need hand-holding; creates a niche for paid deploy/migrate/maintain services — counterpoint: public consortia could standardize.
    - EU/NHS-scale OSS EHR could slash costs → shared development and open data formats reduce vendor lock-in and paperwork duplication.
    - Adoption is limited and mobile unfriendly → traction mainly in developing markets; app-store policies hinder MyGNUHealth; hospitals mostly use PCs.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat GNU Health as core plus paid integration to FHIR/HL7, identity, billing, and local compliance.
    - Impact: Opens market for MSPs and regional health IT teams; pressures incumbents on interoperability and pricing.
    - Watch next: Verified deployments, certification audits, FHIR conformance tests, and an app-store build of MyGNUHealth.
