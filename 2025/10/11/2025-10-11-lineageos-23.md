# LineageOS 23

- Score: 156 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553835) | Link: https://lineageos.org/Changelog-30/

- TL;DR
    - LineageOS 23 draws interest for phones and Android TV, offering a de-Googled, consistent Android that extends device life with monthly patches. HN weighs it against GrapheneOS: Lineage favors breadth and hackability, while Graphene focuses on Pixels, early security updates, and bootloader relocking. TV users see a spyware-free streaming option; some Nvidia Shield installs now need hardware mods, and launcher compatibility questions persist. Users highlight F-Droid-first setups, snappy performance, rooted ADB, and independence from OEM update neglect.

- Comment pulse
    - Android TV use-case → spyware-free streaming boxes; Lineage supports Shield, but latest install may need USB port soldering—counterpoint: launcher compatibility with built-in Google TV unclear.
    - Security updates model → GrapheneOS gets early patches via private source for optional “01” builds; Lineage likely avoids closed code to preserve openness.
    - Who uses it → de-Googled, consistent UI, F-Droid-first, monthly patches, root via Magisk; drawback: many devices can’t relock bootloader, weakening security vs Pixel+Graphene.

- LLM perspective
    - View: LineageOS 23 positions itself as the longevity-focused Android: broad hardware, decent privacy, and community-driven cadence over hardline security.
    - Impact: Likely boosts refurb markets, TV box repurposing, and buyers prioritizing Lineage support; Pixel security purists stick with GrapheneOS.
    - Watch next: Watch device list updates, Catapult launcher on Android TV, any bootloader relock progress, and a stance on early-patch partnerships.
