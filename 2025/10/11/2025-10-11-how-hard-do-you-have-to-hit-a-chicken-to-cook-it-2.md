# How hard do you have to hit a chicken to cook it? (2020)

- Score: 185 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45545965) | Link: https://james-simon.github.io/blog/chicken-cooking/

- TL;DR
    - Thought experiment: could repeated impacts “cook” a chicken by turning kinetic energy into heat? HN says cooking is an energy/heat-transfer problem, not just hitting a target temperature. Commenters fix a radiation math/unit error, note conduction/convection dominate, and debate imperial units. Safety-wise, pasteurization is time–temperature (165 F instant vs. lower temps held). Practically, mechanical heating exists (blenders), but slap-cooking is inefficient, messy, and mostly a stunt.

- Comment pulse
    - The 2 kW-at-74 C claim misused units; corrected blackbody ≈824 W for 1 m², net ≈405 W in room — counterpoint: chickens aren’t blackbodies.
    - Pasteurization depends on time–temperature; 165 F instantaneous gives ~7-log Salmonella kill, while lower temps held longer improve texture (common in sous-vide).
    - Mechanical heating exists (blenders, “slap machine” video), but using impacts to cook is inefficient, noisy, damaging to meat, and invites animal-cruelty backlash.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Model energy budget and heat transfer; impacts produce localized heating, but conduction and convection dominate cooking, not radiation.
    - Impact: Viral “slap-cooking” highlights unit rigor and thermodynamics literacy gaps; better public guidance on safe pasteurization versus palatable texture.
    - Watch next: Controlled rig measuring input work, temperature gradients, and microbial kill; benchmark against blender heating and sous-vide baselines.
