# AV2 video codec delivers 30% lower bitrate than AV1, final spec due in late 2025

- TL;DR
  - AV2, AOMedia’s next codec, targets about 30% lower bitrate than AV1 with comparable quality; the final spec is expected in late 2025. Commenters say streaming quality woes stem more from aggressive provider bitrates and denoising to cut delivery costs than codec limits. AV2’s gains come from more flexible block partitioning, bigger superblocks, and new prediction tools—at the cost of higher encode complexity and hardware decoder demands. Adoption may lag until silicon ships; some watch AOM’s October session and speculate about generative codecs.

- Comment pulse
  - Streamers over-compress to cut CDN costs; denoise/grain removal saves bits but smears detail; COVID normalized lower bitrates—counterpoint: miscalibrated displays exaggerate dark-scene artifacts.
  - AV2 adds flexible block partitioning and larger superblocks plus new intra/inter tools → better compression; tradeoff: higher encode complexity, bigger hardware decoders, and patent landmines.
  - Adoption lags hardware; platforms keep multi-codec catalogs or burn battery on software decode. Eyes on AOM’s October session; some speculate on future generative codecs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: 30% coding gain matters, but provider bitrate caps and denoising policies will dominate perceived quality.
  - Impact: VOD at scale benefits first; live and long tail lag due to higher encode cost and hardware decode rollout.
  - Watch next: hardware decoder timelines, encoder speedups, VMAF-like subjective tests for dark scenes, AVIF/AV2 profile decisions and patent disclosures.
