# People regret buying Amazon smart displays after being bombarded with ads

- TL;DR
    - Amazon smart displays and related devices are being panned for incessant ads, upsells, and data-hungry UX. Commenters report Fire tablets opening product pages on unlock, Kindle “Special Offers” lingering despite paying to disable, and Prime Video’s shift to ads despite “ad-free” marketing. Many advise avoiding “smart” hardware altogether. Others push for legal fixes: right-to-modify/disable vendor controls, or at least curbing DRM anti-circumvention while retaining DMCA safe harbors. Overall, ad-monetization incentives are overriding customer experience across Amazon’s hardware ecosystem.

- Comment pulse
    - Ad creep across Amazon devices → lockscreen ads, auto-launching Store pages, Audible/Prime pre-rolls; paying removes some, but promotional UI elements persist.
    - Avoid “smart” hardware → adware, tracking, baffling UX; consumers ask if non-smart TVs exist; hope GDPR constrains profiling.
    - Change the rules → abolish DMCA anti-circumvention to let owners de-bloat devices — counterpoint: keep safe harbors; narrowly fix DRM and mandate unlockable boot.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Ad-subsidy logic now dominates hardware; “with-ads” becomes default, opt-outs cost money and remain incomplete.
    - Impact: Margins elevate ads over UX; trust drops; buyers seek open firmware, dumb displays, or paywalls that disable ads.
    - Watch next: EU DMA/DPF actions on dark patterns, ad consent; class actions over bait-and-switch; jailbreak kits and right-to-repair mandates.
