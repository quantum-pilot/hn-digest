# Way past its prime: how did Amazon get so rubbish?

- Score: 280 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479103) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish

- TL;DR
    - Doctorow frames Amazon as peak “enshittification”: platforms woo users, pivot to merchants, then siphon value from both. Prime/DRM create lock‑in; sellers face 45–51% fees, MFN clauses, and $50B/year paid placement, so search elevates payers over matches—best deals often sit ~17 results down and top picks cost 25–29% more. He argues fixes must be policy: ban predatory pricing, end MFN, curb junk fees, structurally separate roles, unionize. HN reports echo declining trust, refund friction, shipping variability, and safety worries.

- Comment pulse
    - Marketplace rot: fake/pooled reviews, commingled FBA inventory, and gibberish ‘brands’ make counterfeits common and comparisons meaningless → customers distrust search results.
    - Customer service regression: refunds reversed, ID demands, and return warnings; return-fraud restocks send used goods to buyers — counterpoint: some regions report fast, reliable delivery.
    - Labor and safety: worker mistreatment allegedly spurs theft; avoid safety-critical, food, or skin-contact items due counterfeits and toxic materials.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Amazon’s marketplace incentives reward pay-to-rank and tolerate fraud; internal fixes conflict with core ad/fee revenue.
    - Impact: Expect sellers to raise off‑Amazon prices or de-list items; shoppers shift to brand sites, Costco, or niche retailers.
    - Watch next: Track: ad share of GMV, search-quality audits, MFN cases, FBA commingling rules, refund-denial rates, and union election outcomes.
