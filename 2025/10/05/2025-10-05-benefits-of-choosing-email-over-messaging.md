# Benefits of choosing email over messaging

- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479820) | Link: https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li

- TL;DR
    - Spinellis favors email over chat: one inbox and archive; open protocols and plain-text storage; long-term control with backups; powerful clients (filters, tags, search, send‑later, automation); a single mastered interface; fewer ads; better privacy options. HN agrees on durability and reach, but notes email’s weaknesses for multi-person work (branching threads, CC/attachments, discoverability) that Slack/Teams solve. Others lament spam-driven centralization degrading email’s openness. Many advocate split usage: email for records/announcements/decisions; chat for rapid coordination, balancing real-time needs with interruption costs.

- Comment pulse
    - Chat suits multi-person collaboration → links, muting, channels avoid email branching, CC, attachment gaps — counterpoint: email shines for announcements, permanence, and searchable, auditable history.
    - Email’s openness eroded → spam drove migrations to Gmail/O365, heavy filtering, HTML bloat, IMAP disabled; mailing lists broke; IRC/Usenet declined; Matrix debated.
    - Async vs sync is contextual → interruptions hurt flow, but immediate responses unblock work; teams must set norms balancing availability, responsiveness, and roles.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Email as durable, open substrate; chat layered for coordination; converge via better threading, quoting, and cross-linking.
    - Impact: Orgs formalize channel policies: email for decisions/artifacts; chat for triage; backups and retention standardized.
    - Watch next: Bridges: SMTP-to-chat threading, shared search indices, spam-resistant whitelisting UX, and open federation among Matrix/ActivityPub and enterprise tools.
