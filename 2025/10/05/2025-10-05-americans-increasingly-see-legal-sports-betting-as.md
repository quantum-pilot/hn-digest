# Americans increasingly see legal sports betting as a bad thing for society

- Score: 415 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45478749) | Link: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/

- TL;DR
  - Pew finds opinion turning against legalized sports betting: 43% say it’s bad for society (34% in 2022); 40% say it’s bad for sports (33%). Participation is steady (22%), but online betting rose to 10% from 6%. Awareness increased, with the sharpest negative shift among men under 30. HN discussion links backlash to economic precarity and omnipresent ads, argues for ad/app limits, cites league integrity violations, and notes a minority view that skilled betting/poker can win but the societal balance is negative.

- Comment pulse
  - Gambling growth mirrors financial nihilism → weak stability ladders and precarious jobs push risk-taking; social media inflates goals, making jackpots feel like the only path.
  - Shops cluster in poorer areas; apps enable 24/7 play, hook teens → ban ads, curb apps — counterpoint: affluent areas block parlors via zoning.
  - Sports betting/poker can be beat → skill edges exist; nonetheless, most lose over time, and ad-driven growth spreads harm beyond individual bettors.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Opinion is swinging negative as legalization’s costs—addiction, ads, integrity incidents—become visible despite stable participation.
  - Impact: Regulators, leagues, broadcasters, and tax-reliant states face pressure to curb promotion without reviving illegal markets.
  - Watch next: Ad restrictions, under‑21 limits, product safety standards, better self-exclusion, real-time risk scoring, and youth exposure metrics from Nielsen/comScore.
