# Retiring Test-Ipv6.com

- Score: 244 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45481609) | Link: https://retire.test-ipv6.com/

- TL;DR
  - After 15 years, the creator of test-ipv6.com will retire the site during December 2025 to refocus personal resources. Some components are already open source (falling-sky); geolocation/ISP lookups can’t be released. Mirrors will stop receiving updates, and he’s open to handing the domain to a reputable RIR/NIC. HN responds with gratitude, notes that IPv6 support remains patchy—especially among home ISPs and CPE—and shares routing/MTU pitfalls. IPinfo expresses interest in keeping it alive; some readers sense distress but respect his privacy.

- Comment pulse
  - Gratitude for essential troubleshooting tool → free, reliable IPv6 diagnostics for 15 years helped deployments and support.
  - IPv6 still uneven → home ISPs lag, routing/MTU bugs push users back to IPv4 — counterpoint: many EU providers enable v6 by default; works fine.
  - Continuity path suggested → IPinfo offered to adopt site; operator open to RIR/NIC transfer.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Core testing remains needed until v6 parity; loss leaves gap in simple end-to-end checks.
  - Impact: ISPs/helpdesks must update runbooks; mirrors stale; educators/tools maintainers need replacements.
  - Watch next: Adoption offers from RIR/NIC/IPinfo; forks of falling-sky; alternate testers’ uptime and feature parity.
