# Social Cooling (2017)

- Score: 369 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479165) | Link: https://www.socialcooling.com/

- TL;DR
  - The essay argues that pervasive data collection turns lives into “scores” used by employers, lenders, insurers, and platforms, pushing people toward self-censorship, risk-aversion, and social rigidity. Examples include biased ad targeting, perverse incentives in professional grading, and China’s social credit. HN discussion splits: some claim social media rewards provocation, not conformity; others note most users avoid harassment and optimize for employability. Several frame this as age-old herd pressure amplified by automated surveillance; anonymity is brittle against stylometry and device fingerprints.

- Comment pulse
  - Incentives favor provocation → Social platforms reward attention; a minority “edgelords” gain status. — counterpoint: most people avoid harassment, protect jobs, and self-censor.
  - Social cooling is old pressure, new magnitude → Conformity long predates tech; surveillance and automation monetize the “herd,” chilling government criticism without anonymity.
  - Anonymity tactics fail at scale → Stylometry, device/browser fingerprints, and LLM text-matching can re-link identities; robust OPSEC is rare.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Scoring systems create invisible governance; harms show up as opportunity throttling, not censorship headlines.
  - Impact: Hiring, lending, insurance, education; marginalized groups face compounding penalties via correlated proxies.
  - Watch next: US/EU data broker rules, model auditing mandates, consumer “data diodes,” stylometry-resistant writing tools.
