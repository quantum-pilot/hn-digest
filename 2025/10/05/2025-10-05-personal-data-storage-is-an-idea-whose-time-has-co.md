# Personal data storage is an idea whose time has come

- Score: 347 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45480106) | Link: https://blog.muni.town/personal-data-storage-idea/

- TL;DR
    - The piece argues user-sovereign “personal data storage” should replace platform-owned silos: apps request and cache what they need from your storage, not vice versa. It traces Solid’s vision (pods, standards, enterprise tilt) and highlights AT Protocol/Bluesky’s practical PDS model plus community-run “data-banking” co-ops akin to credit unions. HN debates incremental adoption paths, highlights E2EE “dumb server” tooling, and warns that schemas, identity, and moderation/spam are the hard blockers; laws and incentives may be as critical as protocols.

- Comment pulse
    - Make servers dumb, clients smart → E2EE state lives client-side; storage only for durability; Blobcache/Peergos show viable APIs.
    - Evolve via Bluesky PDS → start with payment tokens to cut merchant PII; credible exits, alt relays signal momentum — counterpoint: usage still clusters on Bluesky.
    - Schemas/ACLs are brittle → Evolving fields and decentralized identity break portability and fine-grained permissions; cross-repo sync risks data loss.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat PDS as capability-based storage; servers attest access, not truth; clients handle schema evolution.
    - Impact: Merchants, publishers, and adtech shift from hoarding PII to tokenized pull-access; co-ops gain fiduciary roles.
    - Watch next: Interop pilots across AT/Solid/ActivityPub; shared schemas and ACLs; anti-spam attestation and rate-limit standards; self-hosted PDS metrics.
