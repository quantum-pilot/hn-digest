# Link Khan: Activision-Blizzard buyout is 'harming both gamers and developers'

- Score: 160 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45482719) | Link: https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/

- TL;DR
  - PC Gamer reports Lina Khan’s “I told you so”: since Microsoft closed the $69B Activision Blizzard deal, Xbox raised Game Pass prices twice and cut thousands (1,900 + 650 + 9,000). Khan argues consolidation let a “too‑big‑to‑care” firm harm gamers and developers; she’s no longer FTC chair but claims vindication. HN debates causality: some say Steam/Valve constrained Microsoft anyway, Game Pass’s early value was unsustainable, and ABK’s problems predated the merger; others call for faster antitrust to matter.

- Comment pulse
  - Steam/Valve blocked Microsoft’s buyout playbook; SteamOS/Proton and Deck reduce Windows reliance. Game Pass dominance unlikely — counterpoint: some find Game Pass good value despite hikes.
  - Consolidation seldom benefits gamers; ABK investors won. Others note past positives (Unity/Unreal, early Blizzard) and argue we can’t prove the no‑merger counterfactual.
  - ABK was already failing; Microsoft hurt itself. Outcomes likely similar without merger; some predict Xbox hardware’s decline by 2030 and asset sales.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Post-merger behavior matches playbook: raise ARPU, cut costs, cancel risks; causality murky, but consumer surplus lower and labor precarity higher.
  - Impact: Gamers pay more and lose titles; developers face subscription cannibalization and higher cancellation risk; rivals Valve, Sony, Nintendo gain leverage.
  - Watch next: Track Game Pass churn/ARPU, Xbox hardware roadmap, potential divestitures, and faster antitrust moves or remedies on subscription tying and exclusivity.
