- Score: 254 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45480506) | Link: https://bhargav.dev/blog/VPS_Setup_and_Security_Checklist_A_Complete_Self_Hosting_Guide

- TL;DR
    - A thorough, step-by-step checklist for securing and deploying on a fresh Ubuntu VPS: create a sudo user, enforce SSH keys, disable root/password logins, set UFW, enable unattended upgrades, install Node.js with PM2, add Nginx reverse proxy, obtain Certbot TLS, set up monitoring, backups, and basic load testing. Hetzner is favored for price/performance in Europe. HN praised the clarity but flagged the title: Coolify isn’t actually covered. Discussion shifted to OVH vs Hetzner value and to simpler flows like Docker Compose/Traefik or CapRover with robust backups.

- Comment pulse
    - Coolify coverage missing → guide preps VPS only; readers wanted setup, features, pitfalls — counterpoint: some run multiple projects on Coolify, though compose import flaky.
    - Provider value vs trust → OVH offers very cheap high-core VPS; mixed perf and ID checks deter some; Hetzner seen faster; shared CPUs mean variable throughput.
    - Workflow preference → Compose/Traefik or CapRover favored for simplicity; Coolify criticized for multi-container quirks, root requirement, missing streaming backups.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Good baseline hardening/ops checklist; Coolify mention premature; treat as generic VPS guide.
    - Impact: Lowers barrier for beginners; helps teams standardize; choice of provider should weigh latency, compliance, and predictable CPU sharing.
    - Watch next: Coolify non-root installer, compose import stability, first-class backups; independent VPS benchmarks, fair-share disclosures, and replication-focused runbooks.
