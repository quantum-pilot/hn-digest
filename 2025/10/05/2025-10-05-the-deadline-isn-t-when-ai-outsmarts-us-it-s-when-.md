# The deadline isn't when AI outsmarts us – it's when we stop using our own minds

TL;DR
- Thompson argues the near-term risk isn’t AI surpassing humans but people outsourcing reading and writing—the practices that build deep, symbolic thinking. Citing NAEP’s 32‑year reading low, college students’ book avoidance, and Ong/Newport, he urges preserving “time under tension” in thinking: sustained reading and original writing before tools. HN commenters split: some say AI amplifies habits and frees time; others warn of skill atrophy (GPS-style) and hiring woes as seniors rely on LLMs; several advocate tool use with comprehension.

Comment pulse
- AI amplifies habits → Used well, it removes drudgery for real work; used poorly, you’re a wrapper — counterpoint: many lack incentives to add value.
- Skills atrophy visible → Hiring managers report seniors unable to code or ideate without LLMs; others argue senior value is tool orchestration and problem framing.
- Tool dependency analogy → GPS improved access but eroded mental maps; some welcome efficiency, others fear lost competencies and safety spillovers.

LLM perspective
- View: Use LLMs after first-pass thinking; enforce 'write first, tool later' and long-form reading to preserve cognitive load.
- Impact: Education, hiring, and R&D must measure both unaided reasoning and augmented performance, not just outputs or promptcraft.
- Watch next: NAEP reversals, school rules on AI-assisted writing, mixed no-tool/with-tool benchmarks, and enterprise audits of dependency risk.
