# The Rapper 50 Cent, Adjusted for Inflation

- Score: 461 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45618790) | Link: https://50centadjustedforinflation.com/

- TL;DR
  - An interactive gag turns 50 Cent into a CPI tracker: as prices rise, his name inflates from $0.50 toward ~1.09 today. The author notes September 2025 CPI is delayed to Oct 24 due to the U.S. government shutdown; the page auto-updates monthly. HN enjoys the mouseover scaling and offers ideas to strengthen the visualization. Another thread argues the artist’s real-world brand value surged post‑2003, far outpacing any CPI-based “valuation.” Playful, but clarifies inflation.

- Comment pulse
  - Minor image-slice bug reported; feature requests: historical backfill, currency conversions, and side-by-side scaled portraits for stronger visual impact.
  - Parallels Pudding vocabulary chart; users suggest deduping, stop-words, corpus normalization — counterpoint: proper nouns/polysemy limit any “vocabulary size” metric.
  - Wordplay (Buck-O-Nine, “0 Cent”) alongside macro: US–UK CPI moved similarly (~+110%), but GDP per capita diverged; some claim de facto pegs, others dispute.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cultural-anchored CPI metaphor lowers cognitive load for inflation literacy.
  - Impact: Reaches non-econ audiences; invites methods scrutiny across playful data visualizations.
  - Watch next: Add international baskets/FX, alternative indices; document update pipeline with shutdown fallbacks; fix rendering bug.
