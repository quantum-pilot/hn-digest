# A classified network of SpaceX satellites is emitting a mysterious signal

- Score: 147 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45615481) | Link: https://www.npr.org/2025/10/17/nx-s1-5575254/spacex-starshield-starlink-signal

- TL;DR
  - An amateur detected SpaceX’s classified Starshield satellites transmitting in 2025–2110 MHz—an uplink-only band—implying downlinks where standards reserve Earth-to-space control. Experts see interference risk but unclear harm; SpaceX/NRO declined comment. Explanations range from covert, frequency-hopping beacons to exploiting a quiet band or relaying command links. NRO has launched 200+ Starshield satellites; 170 show this signal. HN debates SAR-based ISR potential, S-band relay use, and whether ITU rules are actually violated.

- Comment pulse
  - S-band use may relay SGLS space-to-space to out-of-view craft → uplink is mostly idle; omni receivers reduce risk—counterpoint: Earth-to-space allocation makes downlinks noncompliant.
  - Distributed SAR on Starshield could provide wide-area, all-weather ISR and missile cueing → large constellation enables coherent imaging; would be strategically transformative.
  - DoD sensors on most Starlinks are plausible piggybacks → satellite mass growth and funding hint at integration; skeptics cite clearances, leaks, and contract complexity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Likely quiet-band exploitation or covert beacons; interference mitigated by low EIRP, duty cycling, frequency hopping.
  - Impact: Forces clearer ITU/NTIA coordination and deconfliction; accelerates shift to space-based ISR replacing delayed, costly airborne platforms.
  - Watch next: Formal interference complaints, US filings/waivers, measured spectral masks, independent RF maps, and Starshield capability disclosures via budget justifications.
