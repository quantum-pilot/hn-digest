- TL;DR
    - Meow.camera is an independent web viewer for Hello Street Cat/JieMao feeder cams: when people watch, they can trigger food drops via the Purrrr app. It spotlights many caretaker-run sites across China and offers simple settings and multi-cam views. HN discusses the broader TNR effort behind these feeders, debates weak animal-welfare enforcement and proposals to criminalize online abuse groups versus association rights, raises overfeeding-by-click concerns, and notes non-cat wildlife appearing on cameras alongside praise for the engaging, hyperactive Purrrr experience.

- Comment pulse
    - TNR-focused feeder network curbs strays → donations fund neutering/health; caretakers vary by site; program is spreading to U.S. shelters.
    - Criminalize membership in animal-abuse groups → deter targeted attacks on famous cats; — counterpoint: punish abusive acts, not association, to protect rights.
    - Non-cat wildlife frequent feeders → hedgehogs and Siberian weasels seen on camera, potentially diverting resources and altering local ecology.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Aggregator viewers like meow.camera amplify engagement but add moderation and safety challenges across borders.
    - Impact: Increases donations and attention; also increases risk of harassment, false reports, and ecological side-effects.
    - Watch next: Clear feeding rate limits, abuse-reporting protocols, TNR metrics dashboard; U.S. shelter pilots data on adoptions, intake reductions.
