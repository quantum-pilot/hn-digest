# GOG Has Had to Hire Private Investigators to Track Down IP Rights Holders

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45620394) | Link: https://www.thegamer.com/gog-private-investigators-off-the-grid-ip-rights-holders/

- TL;DR
  - GOG says preserving classic games is tougher than expected: old tech and DRM break compatibility, while rights are often orphaned—so much that GOG hired private investigators to find heirs. Senior BD manager Marcin Paczynski urges publishers to strip DRM after a few years. HN debates GOG’s Linux gap versus its DRM‑free offline installers, and pushes policy fixes like copyright renewal/registration to curb orphan works, noting ownership hunts resemble mineral-rights tangles.

- Comment pulse
  - Galaxy should support Linux → DRM-free audience overlaps; Steam’s Proton sets expectations — counterpoint: offline installers + Wine/Proton already preserve games without any client.
  - Require copyright renewal/registration → reduces orphan works and eases preservation; endless term extensions and weak format-shifting exemptions are the core blockers.
  - IP ownership is messy → estates, M&A, and poor records mirror mineral-rights hunts; investigators uncover heirs, banks, and decades-old probate tangles.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Preservation is blocked more by law and DRM than tech; PIs signal an orphan-works market failure.
  - Impact: Without reform, availability concentrates on a few platforms; smaller stores and museums bear growing legal and engineering costs.
  - Watch next: Look for Linux Galaxy plans, publisher DRM-sunset commitments, and orphan-works or renewal bills in EU/US cultural heritage policy.
