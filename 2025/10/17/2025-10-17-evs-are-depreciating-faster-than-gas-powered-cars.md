# EVs are depreciating faster than gas-powered cars

- Score: 269 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45615237) | Link: https://restofworld.org/2025/ev-depreciation-blusmart-collapse/

- TL;DR
  EV resale values are plunging, especially for fleets, because residuals hinge on uncertain battery life, rapid model changes, and price cuts; examples include BluSmart’s $12k taxis selling for ~$3k and Hertz’s multibillion-dollar write-down. Studies show 3–5‑year EV depreciation often exceeds ICE. Regional demand, charging, and brand also matter. HN debates causes: tech-curve dynamics and subsidies vs battery/maintenance uncertainty and Tesla-specific price volatility. Some see a crisis for fleets and lenders; others see consumer upside via cheap used EVs and improving battery-health data.

- Comment pulse
  - Fast tech + subsidies cut new prices → used demand drops; 2024 price cuts and fleet sell-offs worsened residuals — counterpoint: EVs aren’t “half-price, twice-as-good.”
  - Battery uncertainty + no standard SOH reports → buyers discount heavily; used EVs show huge price spreads and unclear 10‑year maintenance versus well-known ICE baselines.
  - Big drop = affordability gains → off‑lease EVs 40–60% off; households pair EV+ICE; CPO programs and battery-health data expected to steady resale.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Depreciation stems from residual-value risk concentrated in batteries and new-car pricing; fix with battery SOH, warranties, and modular ownership.
  - Impact: Fleets, lenders, insurers adjust underwriting and shift to battery-as-a-service; consumers gain cheap used options; weaker-brand residuals face pressure.
  - Watch next: Standardized SOH reporting, OEM CPO expansion, BYD/Tesla pricing, subsidy shifts, and the end of major fleet liquidations.
