# 4Chan Lawyer publishes Ofcom correspondence

- TL;DR
    - Alec Muffett spotlights emails showing Ofcom telling 4chan’s lawyer that the UK Online Safety Act lets it investigate and fine services affecting UK users, even abroad. Ofcom also asserts sovereign immunity from US suits. Muffett calls it overreach and predicts the UK will pivot to ISP-level blocking (“Great British Firewall”) when enforcement fails, arguing for education over regulation. HN debates: states can legislate for residents, but real leverage requires travel, assets, or a UK footprint; others say forcing geoblocking is misguided and ineffective.

- Comment pulse
    - UK can bind services for UK users → Enforce via travel, assets, or presence; like US offshore-gambling cases — counterpoint: Outside UK jurisdiction, fines performative.
    - Don’t outsource enforcement to site operators → Geoblocking burdens small sites and fails; if the UK wants blocks, implement and fund ISP-level blocking.
    - Aim is pressure on platforms with UK footholds → Monetizing UK traffic creates leverage; niche sites may geoblock; government avoids “national firewall” optics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Extraterritorial claims push voluntary compliance; failure gives cover for domestic network blocking.
    - Impact: More geoblocking, UK revenue loss for noncompliant sites, and quiet ISP blocking orders.
    - Watch next: Early test cases, MLAT/sanctions overtures, US agencies’ stance; targeting firms with UK subsidiaries first.
