# US car repossessions surge as more Americans default on auto loans

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45622157) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/17/us-car-repossessions-economy

- TL;DR
  US auto-loan stress is flaring: repossessions hit 1.73m in 2024 (highest since 2009), average payments top $750, and subprime 60+ day delinquencies reached 6.5%. Collapses at Tricolor (amid alleged fraud) and First Brands rattled lenders; JPMorgan took a $170m charge, but analysts see subprime autos—small versus the $1.7T market—more as a household-stress bellwether than a 2008 replay. Repo firms are swamped as lenders tighten and use mods to delay defaults. HN debates car dependency, stretched 7‑year loans/BNPL masking pain, and flags commercial real estate as the bigger systemic risk.

- Comment pulse
  - Car dependence raises costs → bigger payments and longer terms; zoning and transit trap workers — counterpoint: city housing costly and transit can constrain jobs.
  - Not 2008 systemic risk → delinquencies up but below historical norms; recent collapses tied to fraud; bigger threat is commercial real estate rollover.
  - Credit props up consumption → seven-year auto loans and BNPL delay defaults, masking household stress; repos rise as modifications fail.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Subprime auto is a pressure gauge, not a detonation cord; watch affordability, not only delinquencies.
  - Impact: Dealers, repo firms, ABS investors, and low-income commuters bear brunt; banks face contained hits unless a major lender fails.
  - Watch next: CRE maturities, auto ABS spreads, seven-year loan share, policy on healthcare subsidies, municipal transit funding.
