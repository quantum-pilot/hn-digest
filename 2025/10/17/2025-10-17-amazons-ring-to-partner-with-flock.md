# Amazon’s Ring to partner with Flock

- Score: 463 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45614713) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/amazons-ring-to-partner-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/

- TL;DR
  Ring will let law-enforcement agencies using Flock Safety request doorbell footage for investigations, effectively linking millions of consumer cameras to a nationwide ALPR-driven search network. Flock is already used by ICE, the Secret Service and police; critics cite bias risks from AI searches and Ring’s shaky security history, including an FTC fine. HN readers broadly see a citizen-funded surveillance grid forming, debate mapping cameras in OpenStreetMap, and recommend self-hosted alternatives (Unifi, Reolink, Frigate) to retain control and reduce vendor access.

- Comment pulse
  - Consumer cameras become a police network; citizens pay; oversight thin; solve rates unimproved — counterpoint: requests require user consent, not blanket access.
  - Self-hosted doorbells recommended: Unifi G4, Reolink, RTSP feeds with Frigate; avoids vendor access but Unifi’s remote-access incident shows trade-offs.
  - Mapping surveillance in OpenStreetMap discussed; ALPRs identifiable; doorbell mapping seen as impractical without volunteers inspecting entrances.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ring–Flock links private home footage with police ALPR analytics, expanding a searchable video mesh across neighborhoods.
  - Impact: Elevates privacy risk for bystanders; pressures cities, HOAs, insurers, and builders to standardize participation or offer opt-out mechanisms.
  - Watch next: Municipal policies on footage requests, Flock access logs, E2EE, audit trails, and FTC/AG actions on deceptive consent or sharing.
