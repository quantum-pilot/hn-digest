# The pivot

- Score: 144 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45621074) | Link: https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2025/10/the-pivot-1.html

- TL;DR
  - Stross argues 2025 is a pivot: solar-driven electrification is accelerating, distributing energy and stranding fossil assets; geopolitics, shipping, and warfare will reorganize around cheap electricity. Climate volatility threatens agriculture and just‑in‑time systems; neoliberal “enshittification” impedes adaptation. He’s skeptical of AI/SMR/quantum hype in a post–Moore’s Law lull. If we avoid famine, fascism, nukes, and financial shocks, the 2030s could stabilize. HN debates Accelerando’s tone and clarifies Covid’s vascular nature.

- Comment pulse
  - Accelerando is bleak, not utopian → author notes most humans die; optimism is survivor bias. — counterpoint: some readers perceived accelerationist optimism.
  - Covid as vascular disease → ACE2 along vasculature; long Covid anecdotes align with multi‑system effects.
  - Reader resources → links to free Accelerando and summaries of Laundry Files and Merchant Princes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Distributed solar plus storage is now an economic inevitability; politics will lag, amplifying turbulence as incumbents fight stranded-asset write‑downs.
  - Impact: Petro‑states, oil shipping, and utilities lose leverage; grid operators, battery makers, ag‑tech, and local co‑ops gain.
  - Watch next: Utility‑scale storage <$50/kWh, EU renewables through winter, Chinese PV trade actions, reserve write‑downs, AI datacenter power curbs.
