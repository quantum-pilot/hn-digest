- TL;DR
    - A Science study reports dendrite–dendrite nanotubes that form a nonsynaptic network ferrying calcium and small molecules—and transmitting human amyloid‑β between neurons. Super‑resolution/EM plus ML show these bridges are distinct from synapses; blocking their formation halts Ca2+ and Aβ transfer. In an Alzheimer’s mouse model, nanotube density rises before plaques; modeling predicts selective intracellular Aβ buildup. HN debated Penrose/quantum angles (largely dismissed), the legitimacy of “super‑resolution,” ongoing anatomical surprises, and whether this should reshape artificial neural-network design.

- Comment pulse
    - Not quantum consciousness → nanotubes enable classical cargo transfer; undermines Orch‑OR ties to cognition — counterpoint: others see broad support for non‑synaptic mechanisms in thinking.
    - Super‑resolution is microscopy, not AI upscaling → methods like STORM/SRRF surpass diffraction to resolve sub‑100‑nm structures; widely used, peer‑reviewed.
    - ANN redesign premature → DNTs mainly carry molecules/ions, not high‑bandwidth signals; ANNs already diverged far from biological wiring.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Parallel dendritic nanotubes add material-exchange connectivity; they likely modulate homeostasis and pathology more than fast information processing.
    - Impact: Prioritize AD mechanisms targeting nanotube formation/traffic; update connectomics and diffusion models to include nonsynaptic conduits.
    - Watch next: In vivo human evidence, selective markers/inhibitors, transport bandwidth/latency measurements, and causality tests linking nanotube modulation to cognitive/behavioral outcomes.
