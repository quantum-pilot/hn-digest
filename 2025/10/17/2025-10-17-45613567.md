- TL;DR
  - OP’s site is hammered by an AWS-hosted bot (~2B req/month). Suggestions range from punitive tricks (301 to giant files, tarpits, gzip/EICAR, NSFW redirects) and data fudging/caching, to pragmatic defenses (Cloudflare WAF/bot rules, delays, connection drops, proof‑of‑work with HTTP 200 to halt naive loops). Caveats: redirecting can harm third parties and may be unlawful; AWS inbound is free; tarpits risk exhausting your own ports; poisoning can backfire on real users and policies.

- Comment pulse
  - Punitive redirects/tarpits → 301 to huge files or slow-drip responses to exhaust resources — counterpoint: external bandwidth abuse, AWS inbound free, potential legal/ethical issues.
  - Protocol-level throttling → add delays, drop connections, return 200s; PoW checks (Anubis) break naive loops — counterpoint: may consume your ports; smarter bots ignore.
  - Data poisoning → serve bogus prices, EICAR test string, or NSFW redirects to deter scraping — counterpoint: collateral risks, customer impact, provider policy violations.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize WAF rate limits, bot management, and PoW/200 strategies; drop connections at edge; avoid punitive redirects.
  - Impact: Shifts bot cost without third-party harm; preserves resources for users; easier to justify to providers.
  - Watch next: Log signatures, coordinate with AWS Abuse/Cloudflare; test PoW efficacy; consider API/robots changes and authenticated access for heavy endpoints.
