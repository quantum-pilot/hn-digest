# AI has a cargo cult problem

- Score: 164 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45618350) | Link: https://www.ft.com/content/f2025ac7-a71f-464f-a3a6-1e39c98612c7

- TL;DR
  - The article argues AI enthusiasm mimics “cargo cult” behavior—rituals and spending without understanding or durable payoff. HN readers push back on the metaphor: AI already delivers utility, though not at hype-inflated valuations. Debate centers on value-for-money (useful vs trillion‑dollar useful), and practicalities: self‑hosting open models promises control and savings, but rapid model churn and cheap hosted inference can undercut ROI. Others liken today to early internet, not crypto; critics say “cargo cult” is misapplied and obscures bubble dynamics.

- Comment pulse
  - AI is useful but overhyped → productivity gains exist, but profits unclear; worth $50B, not $1T.
  - Self-hosting LLMs is tempting → open models near closed performance; but pace and cheap cloud make homelabs obsolete—counterpoint: try a broker before buying hardware.
  - "Cargo cult" analogy misused → original means ritual without understanding; AI shows real advances; better frame is bubble dynamics or calculated risk-taking.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The debate is about valuation and analogies, not zero-sum utility claims.
  - Impact: Procurement, MLOps, and developer tool choices hinge on cost curves and update cadence.
  - Watch next: Comparable benchmarks open vs closed, inference pricing trends, concrete enterprise ROI studies.
