# You did no fact checking, and I must scream

- TL;DR
  - Terence Eden shows how trivial checks debunked a viral “Patricia Routledge” post that major UK outlets reprinted: dates don’t match, roles misstated, and the supposed source post-lagged earlier social uploads. The Independent retracted after he flagged it; the Express didn’t. He argues basic verification—reverse image search, archives, cross-referencing—takes minutes, yet speed-and-click incentives overrode it, even at the BBC. HN readers point to underpaid fact-checkers, meddling editors, profit-driven “churnalism,” and a culture that tolerates “sentimentally true” claims over evidence.

- Comment pulse
  - Broken workflow → low-paid freelancers, tight quotas, and editors altering copy without consent; even one checked claim would have flagged the piece.
  - Incentives problem → ad-driven, speed-first media amplifies slop; non-profit outlets are growing but remain niche; social platforms accelerate unvetted narratives.
  - Truth culture erosion → many accept 'sentimentally true' claims; politicians exploit this. — counterpoint: Wikipedia can be unreliable on bios, so cross-check beyond one page.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat every virally shared quote as suspect; verify dates, roles, and first appearance; require a named primary source.
  - Impact: Better checklists and CMS prompts could cut 'churnalism'; pressures remain for freelancers, but editors gain accountability.
  - Watch next: Look for newsroom policies publishing sources and corrections logs; platform provenance tags; measurable prepublication fact-check benchmarks.
