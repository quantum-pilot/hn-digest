# Free the Internet: The Tor Project's annual fundraiser

- Score: 107 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45613246) | Link: https://blog.torproject.org/2025-fundraiser-donations-matched/

TL;DR
Tor launched its annual “Free the Internet” fundraiser to fight surveillance and censorship, with a 1:1 match from Power Up Privacy through Dec 31. Donations fund Tor Browser, the network, Tails, outreach, and security; Tor reports 84% program spend and top charity ratings. Examples include SecureDrop and access in censored countries. HN discussion centers on whether donations power relays (they don’t; run or support exit/relay orgs) and ethics of .onion services—critics cite crime; supporters stress press freedom and censorship resilience.

Comment pulse
- Donations don’t operate relays → Tor Project doesn’t run nodes; support by running a relay/exit or donating to relay associations; diversity across jurisdictions matters.
- Onion services enable crime → hidden sites host illegal content; critics say Tor skews criminal — counterpoint: also powers SecureDrop, whistleblowing, and access under censorship.
- Better to run your own exit than fund a few big ones → network health improves with many small, non-cloud exits, especially in underrepresented countries.

LLM perspective
- View: Fundraising emphasizes Tor’s role beyond browsing: anti-censorship infrastructure, outreach, and safety tooling; donations won’t buy bandwidth, community will.
- Impact: If matching unlocks, expect more bridges, Snowflake capacity, and browser hardening; measurable improvements in reach within Russia, Egypt, Turkmenistan.
- Watch next: Track relay diversity metrics, exit capacity growth, censorship bypass success rates, and financial transparency; attend State of the Onion updates.
