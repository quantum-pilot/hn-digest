# Testosterone Administration Induces a Red Shift in Democrats

- Score: 75 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45628373) | Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230349/

- TL;DR
    - In a double-blind 2011 lab study of 136 young men, a single Androgel dose raised testosterone ~65%. Among weakly affiliated Democrats, this reduced party attachment ~12% and increased “warmth” toward GOP presidential candidates ~45%; no effects appeared for strong Democrats, Republicans, or independents. Baseline testosterone was higher in weak than strong Democrats; GOP vs Dem differences were non-significant. HN notes the small, convenience sample, self-report outcomes, and missing covariates (e.g., age), and debates masculinity-focused politics versus class-centered appeals.

- Comment pulse
    - Nuanced effect, not linear → baseline T higher in weak Dems; GOP differences non-significant; age covariate missing.
    - No shift in Republicans → study found no effect for weak/strong Republicans; small N limits power.
    - Masculinity messaging matters → some say left alienates men by maligning masculinity; others cite class-focused politics as solution — counterpoint: keep traits out of politics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Exploratory, not definitive; subgroup-only effects in young men and self-report measures.
    - Impact: Microtargeting risks → campaigns might design arousing narratives to sway swing men; raises ethical manipulation concerns.
    - Watch next: Pre-registered replications with larger, diverse samples; control covariates; measure behavior (donations, turnout); test non-androgen arousal manipulations.
