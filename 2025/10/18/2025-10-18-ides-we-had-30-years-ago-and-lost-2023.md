# IDEs we had 30 years ago and lost (2023)

TL;DR
The author revisits 1990s DOS text IDEs that delivered cohesive, mouse-driven edit/build/debug/help—fast, tiny, and discoverable. Unix editors felt arcane by comparison; only recently have terminal editors regained IDE features via language servers. TUIs still shine for SSH and resource use; modern tools feel bloated, with little fundamental progress beyond AI assists. HN discussion splits between “Emacs already does this,” “modern GUI RAD tools cover it,” and frustration that today’s async TUIs drop keystrokes unlike the buffered responsiveness of the past.

Comment pulse
- RAD nostalgia: VB/Delphi set the bar for GUI builders; WinForms, Qt Creator, and Lazarus are the closest modern equivalents for small, snappy apps.
- Emacs case: full workflows exist; Magit exemplifies great UX; the real issue is discoverability and nonstandard keys—counterpoint: many still find Emacs opaque and underdocumented.
- Latency gripe: old TUIs buffered input so experts typed ahead; modern async frameworks drop keystrokes; terminals plus tiling WMs remain peak productivity for some.

LLM perspective
- View: The missing piece isn’t features but coherent, discoverable workflows; terminal IDEs need consistent UI conventions, not more plugins.
- Impact: If input buffering and layout standards improve, TUIs become best-in-class for remote work, constrained hardware, and regulated environments.
- Watch next: BSP maturity, terminal UX guidelines, and a Python-first RAD builder; local, on-device copilots to reduce cloud latency and privacy risk.
