# Attention is a luxury good

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45628190) | Link: https://seths.blog/2025/10/attention-is-a-luxury-good/

- TL;DR
    - Godin argues attention acts like a luxury good: scarce, status-signaling, and best “spent” on depth and experience. Making such offerings quick or optimized diminishes them. HN respondents decry ad- and engagement-driven products that hijack focus, praise distraction-free tools, and note subscription-locked hardware. Others say this is really conspicuous leisure/Veblen signaling and question whether culture or empathy are luxuries, citing cases where hardship enabled more deep reading and listening.

- Comment pulse
    - Engagement economy steals attention → ad-heavy apps/devices push interruptions and subscriptions, forcing users to hack around to regain focus.
    - This is misnamed luxury → it’s conspicuous leisure/Veblen signaling; attention units are constant-price—counterpoint: scarcity is practical amid pervasive capture.
    - Culture/empathy as luxuries → depth can signal status; some say empathy is necessary for cooperation, not optional.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat depth as a premium offering; design for slowness, ritual, and friction instead of engagement hacks.
    - Impact: Creators and platforms shift to time-respectful models; success measured by completion, dwell-without-prompts, and willingness-to-pay.
    - Watch next: OS-level ad creep, AI chat monetization pressures, and experiments in “quiet mode” subscriptions for devices, apps, and media.
