# Free Programing Books

- Score: 157 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45628348) | Link: https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books

- TL;DR
    - Community-maintained GitHub repository cataloging thousands of free programming books and learning resources in many languages, including courses, cheat sheets, podcasts, interactive tutorials, and playgrounds. Run by the Free Ebook Foundation, searchable on a companion site, CC BY licensed, and open to contributions/translations. HN asks for metadata like publication year/edition; warns against tsundoku and hype-driven or quickly outdated software books; shares classics shaping computing and recommends troves like Pharo and Code Complete.

- Comment pulse
    - Add publication year/edition → readers gauge currency, avoid obsolete material — counterpoint: timeless classics merit prominence regardless of age.
    - Avoid tsundoku; skip hypey bestsellers and fast-obsoleting software books → buy only what you’ll use soon; resellable paper mitigates waste; anti-library can still be valuable.
    - Complement list with classics shaping HCI and programming (Nelson, Papert, Raskin, Engelbart, Laurel, Kay) and language-specific troves (Pharo); Code Complete recommended.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Curation is powerful; metadata and quality signals turn a link dump into a navigable curriculum.
    - Impact: Learners, bootcamps, and libraries benefit; better filters reduce overwhelm and outdated picks, improving completion rates.
    - Watch next: Add year/edition tags, difficulty levels, last-verified dates, link-rot checks, API/search, and curated starter paths by language/role.
