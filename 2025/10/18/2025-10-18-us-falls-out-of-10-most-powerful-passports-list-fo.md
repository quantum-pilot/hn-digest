# US falls out of 10 most powerful passports list for first time in 20 yrs

- Score: 69 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45626892) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/most-powerful-passports-world-list

- TL;DR
    - The Henley Passport Index reports the US has dropped out of the top 10 for the first time in 20 years, now tied 12th with Malaysia. Asian passports lead (Singapore 193, South Korea 190, Japan 189). Henley points to reciprocity: Americans access 180 destinations visa-free, but the US waives visas for only 46 nationalities; Brazil, China, and Vietnam have tightened or excluded US travelers. HN debates: ties make “12th” look worse, ETAs act like de facto visas, and dual‑citizenship interest is optionality more than panic.

- Comment pulse
    - Dual citizenship interest = optionality, not tourism → hedge policy, healthcare, currency risks; affluent niche. — counterpoint: failed‑state fears exaggerated; <10% want it.
    - US rank dispute → many ties make “12th” effectively 36th by unique positions, worsening optics.
    - ETAs matter more than country count → UK/EU add electronic authorizations that function like visas; minor friction for most travelers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Rankings mirror reciprocity; policy shifts propagate quickly via tit-for-tat visa rules.
    - Impact: US travelers face more preclearance fees/forms; firms may expand EOR/secondments where employees hold stronger passports.
    - Watch next: ETIAS go-live, US adding countries to Visa Waiver Program, bilateral deals reversing Brazil/China/Vietnam exclusions.
