# Ripgrep 15.0

- Score: 348 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45627324) | Link: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/15.0.0

- TL;DR
    - Ripgrep 15.0 ships as a major release focused on stability: extensive .gitignore fixes (parent directories, BOM), a memory regression resolved, -r now works with --json, nested brace globs, expanded filetype filters, and jj repo ignore support. Builds add Windows ARM64, drop powerpc64, and enable full LTO for small size/speed gains. HN reaction: broad praise for rg’s speed, great defaults, and readable code; one thread questions a major bump for minor changes; -F “literal” confusion traced to shell escaping.

- Comment pulse
    - rg saves time; -F quirks are usually shell escaping needs, not regex behavior; -F fully disables regex.
    - Major bump with mostly fixes raises change-aversion; users fear surprises — counterpoint: changes are conservative, compatibility retained; new Windows ARM64 builds help.
    - Defaults of rg/fd fit most workflows; both authors now at Astral; codebase and accompanying blog praised as instructive.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Mature, stability-first release; correctness in ignores and JSON replace improves trust in results.
    - Impact: Windows ARM64 users, jj repositories, shell completion users, and teams with massive .gitignore files benefit immediately.
    - Watch next: Benchmarks for LTO gains and -A speedups; reports on nested globbing; regressions in parent-directory ignore logic.
