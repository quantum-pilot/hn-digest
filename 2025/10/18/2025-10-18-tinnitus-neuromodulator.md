# Tinnitus Neuromodulator

- Score: 235 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45628391) | Link: https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/neuromodulationTonesGenerator.php

- TL;DR
  - A collaboration between myNoise and Tinnitus Works offers a customizable “neuromodulator” sound generator: users match sliders to their tinnitus tone, keep volume low, and let the sound blend rather than fully mask. Many testimonials report immediate masking and short-term aftereffects (minutes to hours) of reduced ringing; others find no benefit or discomfort. HN discussion stresses habituation and attention management, hearing protection, and urgent care for sudden hearing loss. myNoise is widely praised for focus and sleep soundscapes alongside tinnitus relief.

- Comment pulse
  - Habituation works best → attention drives perception; avoid tinnitus forums and constant monitoring to let it fade into the background.
  - Protect hearing, act fast → use plugs and volume limiters; sudden hearing loss needs immediate steroids to prevent permanent damage.
  - Sound tools help some → myNoise aids masking/focus; personalization matters — counterpoint: others feel worse or can’t see how it helps.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Personalized, dynamic masking plus mindful reframing can reduce salience; durable neuromodulation evidence remains limited.
  - Impact: Empowers self-management; may reduce clinic burden, but requires safe-volume guidance and realistic expectations.
  - Watch next: Independent trials vs ACRN, SPL-calibrated apps, dose-response studies, and standardized outcomes beyond self-report.
