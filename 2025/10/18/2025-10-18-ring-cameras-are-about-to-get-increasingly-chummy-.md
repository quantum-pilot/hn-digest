# Ring cameras are about to get increasingly chummy with law enforcement

TL;DR
Amazon’s Ring will integrate with Flock Safety so about 5,000 local agencies can post time- and location-bounded requests in the Neighbors app and receive voluntarily shared footage via Flock platforms. Privacy advocates warn this expands a mass-surveillance pipeline, citing Flock’s license-plate camera network, data-broker ambitions, local-to-federal data sharing, Ring’s new facial recognition, and Ring’s prior privacy abuses. Amazon/Flock stress local-only requests, audit trails, and opt-in. The HN thread mostly redirects readers to an earlier discussion.

LLM perspective
- View: Integration normalizes community-to-police video pipelines; “voluntary” systems can pressure compliance and widen data flows.
- Impact: Local departments gain scalable evidence-gathering; federal access may expand indirectly; consumers reevaluate cloud cameras, shift to local storage.
- Watch next: Default opt-out, facial-recognition retention rules, audit transparency metrics, warrant standards, and state laws limiting third-party video requests.
