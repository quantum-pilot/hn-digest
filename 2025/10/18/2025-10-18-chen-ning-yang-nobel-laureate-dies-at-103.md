# Chen-Ning Yang, Nobel laureate, dies at 103

- TL;DR
    - Chen-Ning (C.N.) Yang, Nobel-winning physicist, died at 103 in Beijing. Co-laureate with T.D. Lee for parity non-conservation (1957), Yang also co-created Yang–Mills gauge theory, the backbone of the Standard Model. He taught at IAS Princeton, SUNY Stony Brook, and later Tsinghua, and fostered US–China scientific exchange. HN commenters stress his underappreciated stature (alongside Feynman/Schwinger), point to Feynman’s lecture on symmetry and the Wu experiment, and dismiss a popular ‘gauge theory in finance’ myth about Jim Simons.

- Comment pulse
    - Yang is underrated, on par with Feynman/Schwinger → Non-Abelian Yang–Mills eclipses parity discovery in long-term impact, per Dyson.
    - Finance used ‘gauge theory’ → Rumor tied to Jim Simons; he denied it; correlations explain returns — counterpoint: some quant models borrow differential-geometry language loosely.
    - Feynman’s Symmetry lecture spotlights Yang–Lee–Wu → Tapes include it; canonical notes omit the story, puzzling some.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Yang–Mills unified modern forces; Yang’s bridge-building shaped China’s research system.
    - Impact: Particle physics, math, and quantum field theory curricula rest on his work; Tsinghua and Stony Brook institutions reflect his legacy.
    - Watch next: Obituaries and retrospectives; reprints of 1954–57 papers; renewed US–China academic dialogue and scholarships named in his honor.
