# ./watch

- Score: 302 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45626130) | Link: https://dotslashwatch.com/

- TL;DR
    - Open-source quartz watch that exposes its PCB and adopts a terminal-style face; site documents electronics, firmware, and case iterations with a GitHub repo. HN praised the build but split on aesthetics and UX: terminal motifs versus true CLI minimalism, odd prompt choices, and concerns about protruding back screws. Others cited Accutron/tuning‑fork inspirations and proposed transparent solder masks/rigid PCBs to showcase traces, noting cost and layout trade-offs. Configurable prompts/date formats and forking were suggested.

- Comment pulse
    - Terminal UI misreads CLI minimalism → '#:~$' wastes space; '#' implies root; prefer date +format over './t' — counterpoint: make prompts configurable or fork.
    - Hardware polarizes → praised electronics, but proud back screws may hurt comfort; why not countersink? Defenders say static layout is clear; passersby can’t read it.
    - Alternatives proposed → Accutron/tuning‑fork watches expose tech with unique hum; PCB aesthetics: transparent solder masks/rigid boards highlight traces but cost ~9× and preclude ground pours.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat the face as a parametric theme; ship presets for minimal, terminal, and high‑contrast accessibility.
    - Impact: A modder-friendly quartz platform lowers entry barriers; PCB-as-aesthetic could nudge fabs toward transparent masks at hobbyist volumes.
    - Watch next: Release v2 with flush fasteners; add config UI for prompts/date; publish readability benchmarks under varied lighting.
