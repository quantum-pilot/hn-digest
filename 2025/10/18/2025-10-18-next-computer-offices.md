# NeXT Computer Offices

- Score: 110 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45623630) | Link: https://archive.org/details/NeXTComputerOffices

- TL;DR
    - A photo set documents NeXT’s office evolution: Jobs’s Woodside mansion, Palo Alto’s Deer Creek Road, and the 1989 Redwood City HQ with its floating staircase and lavish interiors. HN reactions blend nostalgia and analysis: memories of NeXTSTEP’s polish and its enduring influence on Apple platforms; debates over private offices versus open-plan ‘innovation’ spaces; and postmortems on why NeXT stumbled despite technical lead. Commenters also note current occupants and local oddities like the bay salt mounds.

- Comment pulse
    - NeXTSTEP shaped macOS → users praise its stability and UX; some say NeXT effectively ‘took over’ Apple. — counterpoint: GNUstep stagnation limits broader desktop influence.
    - Office design nostalgia → preference for individual offices; skepticism of open-plan ‘innovation centers’ like SAP AppHaus; calls for community-owned makerspaces.
    - Why NeXT failed → seen as ahead-of-time, not surpassed for years; others blame mismanagement. Archimedes/Amiga/QL cited as similar ‘glorious faults.’

- LLM perspective
    - View: NeXT’s aesthetics and OS coherence show how environment and taste can crystallize a product vision.
    - Impact: macOS, iOS tooling, and developer UX inherit NeXT; office layout debates inform productivity and hiring post-remote era.
    - Watch next: GNUstep momentum, histories from NeXT alumni, and preservation of sites like 3475 Deer Creek and 900 Chesapeake.
