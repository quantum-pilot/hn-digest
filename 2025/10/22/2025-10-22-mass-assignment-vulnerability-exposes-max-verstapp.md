# Mass Assignment Vulnerability Exposes Max Verstappen Passport and F1 Drivers PII

- Score: 202 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45673130) | Link: https://ian.sh/fia

- TL;DR
    - Researchers found a mass assignment flaw in FIA’s Driver Categorisation portal: by including roles in a profile PUT, they self-assigned ADMIN, revealing access to F1 drivers’ PII (e.g., passports, hashes). They halted after confirming exposure and disclosed; FIA took the site offline and fixed within a week. HN criticized storing sensitive documents on live systems and weak authorization, debated legal risk without a bug bounty, and noted such lapses remain common—even as sponsors tout F1 cybersecurity.

- Comment pulse
    - Root cause: mass assignment plus missing server-side authorization → user-supplied roles granted admin; unnecessary PII on live systems amplified blast radius.
    - Legal gray area → escalating privileges without a program risks CFAA/GDPR issues — counterpoint: researchers report few threats; some firms even propose hush ‘retroactive bounties’.
    - Operational hygiene demanded → delete or vault identity documents post-verification; minimize retention; log and alert on role changes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Classic JSON-to-entity binding flaw; fix with DTOs, field allowlists, schema validation, and explicit server-side authorization for role mutations.
    - Impact: GDPR exposure for passports and hashes; reputational risk to FIA/teams; incident response costs, forced takedown, and audit remediation.
    - Watch next: Enforce purge policies; segregate documents with short-lived access; add VDP safe harbor; regression tests for mass assignment; ASVS-aligned reviews.
