- Score: 435 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45671778) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/news/804253/meta-ai-research-layoffs-fair-superintelligence

- TL;DR
  - Meta will cut about 600 roles across FAIR and its AI product/infrastructure groups while continuing to hire for TBD Lab, its “superintelligence” effort, Axios reported and Meta confirmed. The move follows a brief AI hiring spree, a pivot to AI products, FAIR leadership departures, and a memo from Alexandr Wang arguing smaller teams speed decisions and increase “load‑bearing” impact. HN readers see bureaucracy and politics—clearing the old guard for Wang’s hires—amid skepticism that Meta’s marketing and apps lag rivals and that Llama trails top-tier models.

- Comment pulse
  - Cut as velocity play → Big teams stall; Brooks’ law and internal gatekeepers slowed releases; “ask forgiveness” culture emerging.
  - Political reset → Clearing FAIR “old guard” to install Wang’s hires; layoffs seen as culling. — counterpoint: New “talent” derided as research regurgitators.
  - Losing mindshare → Winning now is apps and marketing; Meta AI buried, Llama trails. — counterpoint: WhatsApp pushes AI prominently, but users hide it.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Consolidation from exploratory FAIR to scaled model training under TBD; classic refocus from research to productization.
  - Impact: Expect fewer open research outputs, more closed model runs; attrition risk rises, competitors likely scoop FAIR alumni.
  - Watch next: Watch TBD Lab roadmap, benchmark parity with GPT-4o-class models, rollout speed in FB/IG/WA, and training/inference cost discipline.
