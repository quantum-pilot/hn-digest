# Look, Another AI Browser

- TL;DR
    - Manu argues the wave of “AI browsers” (OpenAI Atlas, Perplexity Comet, DIA, Opera) are rebranded Chromium, not new browsers. He mocks the hype, noting that if superintelligence were near, building a browser engine shouldn’t be out of reach—yet everyone ships wrappers. HN replies split: some say reuse is practical and the real questions are extensions, ad blocking, and monetization; others warn of Google’s control over Chromium, push for alternative engines, and raise privacy risks from AI-driven profiling and data retention.

- Comment pulse
    - Chromium reuse is pragmatic → Compat, security, and scale favor it; innovate via extensions — counterpoint: thin add-ons won’t drive switching; extension power shrinks.
    - Google steers Chromium → Manifest V3, Web Environment Integrity show platform control; support Gecko today and projects like Ladybird/Servo to preserve diversity.
    - AI browsers risk surveillance → Log reading history, profile users, enable ads; could bypass crawler blocks via users, complicating ad-blocker and monetization fights.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Shipping Chromium shells with AI is incremental; real value would be open, powerful extension APIs or engine-level capabilities beyond assistants.
    - Impact: Atlas-like products entrench Chromium dominance and ad-funded models; privacy expectations shift as page-level logging becomes normalized.
    - Watch next: Atlas’s ad-blocker stance and data retention policy; Ladybird/Servo milestones; Google’s next moves on Manifest V3/WEI and any regulatory response.
