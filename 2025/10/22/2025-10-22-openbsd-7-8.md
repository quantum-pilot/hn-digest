# OpenBSD 7.8

- Score: 271 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45664147) | Link: https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.8/ANNOUNCEMENT

- TL;DR
    - OpenBSD 7.8 focuses on correctness-first performance and broader hardware: SMP-parallel TCP and softnet threads, improved suspend/S0ix, and Raspberry Pi 5 plus Qualcomm DRM. VMM/VMD and KVM gain AMD SEV‑ES confidential VM support; drivers expand 2.5–100G NIC features and Wi‑Fi stability. Security hardening includes guard pages, pledge tweaks, LibreSSL 4.2.0, and OpenSSH 10.2 with PQ‑safety warnings and agent changes. HN notes OpenBSD’s small, integrated base and httpd ease, debates lack of journaling, and reports multi-core networking gains on modest firewall hardware.

- Comment pulse
    - BSDs feel simpler and lighter → Linux shows hundreds of kernel threads in top; OpenBSD hides them, yielding ~<20 processes; alternatives: Void/Arch approximate BSD minimalism.
    - No journaling; softupdates removed → FFS2 favors synchronous correctness; occasional fsck after power loss — counterpoint: reports of robustness, low data loss; Hammer2 port exists.
    - Networking throughput is up → multi-CPU TCP, parallel IPv6, more driver queues/TSO; users report 2x gains and 1–2.5GbE saturation on modest routers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: OpenBSD prioritizes auditable simplicity while steadily unlocking SMP in networking and modernizing hardware without chasing feature creep.
    - Impact: Better fit for routers, SBCs, and AMD SEV‑ES hosts; admins gain defaults via pledge tweaks, guard pages, and OpenSSH changes.
    - Watch next: Independent fs journaling or Hammer2 integration, more driver MP-ification, and reproducible benchmarks of TCP scaling on common firewall hardware.
