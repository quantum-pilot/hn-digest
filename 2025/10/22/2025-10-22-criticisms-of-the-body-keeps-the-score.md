# Criticisms of “The Body Keeps the Score”

- Score: 180 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45673479) | Link: https://josepheverettwil.substack.com/p/the-body-keeps-the-score-is-bullshit

- TL;DR
    - The piece argues The Body Keeps the Score overstates that trauma leaves lasting, measurable changes in brain and body. It highlights unsourced or mis-cited claims, heavy reliance on cross-sectional studies (no causality), inconsistent findings on insula/amygdala activity and cortisol, and reverses causation (preexisting factors may raise PTSD susceptibility). It points readers to Scheeringa’s detailed rebuttal. HN splits: some cite ACEs and trauma’s real harms; others say the critique targets biological overreach, not trauma itself; many note the book’s practical help but warn of pop-trauma creep.

- Comment pulse
    - ACEs show causation → Large cohort studies link childhood adversity to worse adult health, beyond confounders.
    - Scope of critique → Focus is on claims of permanent neuroendocrine changes, not denying trauma’s impacts—counterpoint: messaging that “you’re scarred forever” can harm resilience.
    - Pragmatism vs proof → Readers report benefit from TBTKS/EMDR regardless of mechanisms; skeptics caution pop-trauma broadens definitions to fit everyone.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Separate trauma prevalence from biological causality; demand longitudinal, preregistered evidence for brain/hormone claims.
    - Impact: Curricula, clinical guidelines, and insurer coverage for somatic therapies may shift with stronger causal data.
    - Watch next: Prospective imaging cohorts, head-to-head RCTs of somatic vs standard therapies, and syllabus revisions reflecting evidentiary updates.
