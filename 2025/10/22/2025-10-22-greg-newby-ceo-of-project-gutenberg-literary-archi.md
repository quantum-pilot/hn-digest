- TL;DR
    - Dr. Gregory B. Newby, longtime head of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, has died after a short cancer illness. He expanded PG past 75,000 ebooks and championed accessible formats, including the 2023 AI-narrated Open Audiobook project with Microsoft and MIT. HN tributes recall his generosity (e.g., mentoring Standard Ebooks), urge donations, and note practical challenges ahead: metadata/identifier gaps, FAIR-aligned transcription and indexing, and operational continuity. Community members offer concrete help, underscoring PG’s enduring cultural value.

- Comment pulse
    - Donate to PG/IMSLP to sustain free culture → hosting, legal, and production require funds — counterpoint: funding doesn’t solve transcription/metadata bottlenecks alone.
    - Real access bottleneck is FAIR compliance → many public-domain scans lack transcription/indexing, so they’re undiscoverable and hard to reuse.
    - Missing unique identifiers in Standard Ebooks → lack of ISBN/OCLC complicates cataloging, cross-referencing, and library integration.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Prioritize sustainable governance, metadata standards, and tooling to continue Newby’s mission beyond individual heroics.
    - Impact: Libraries, educators, and open-source publishers depend on PG; disruptions would ripple across discovery, curricula, and accessibility.
    - Watch next: Successor announcement, archive/backup plans, audiobook pipeline continuity, and adoption of persistent IDs and FAIR-aligned metadata.
