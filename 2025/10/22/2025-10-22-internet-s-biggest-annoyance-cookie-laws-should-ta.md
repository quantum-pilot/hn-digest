# Internet's biggest annoyance: Cookie laws should target browsers, not websites

- Score: 526 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45667866) | Link: https://nednex.com/en/the-internets-biggest-annoyance-why-cookie-laws-should-target-browsers-not-websites/

- TL;DR
    - The piece argues cookie banners are a UX and policy failure: users should set data-consent once in the browser, which then enforces it everywhere. Centralized, browser-level consent would reduce fatigue, lift compliance burdens on small sites, and let regulators audit a few browsers instead of millions of sites; DNT failed because sites ignored it. HN debate spans enforcement vs bad law, feasibility of browser-side purpose tagging and per-site overrides, and ad-tech incentives, with proposals from mandating DNT/GPC to outright bans on tracking.

- Comment pulse
    - It’s enforcement, not law → courts are pushing “Decline all” and GPC; malicious compliance persists—counterpoint: if law allows it, it’s a bad law.
    - Browser-level consent is nontrivial → browsers can’t infer ‘necessary’; would need cookie purpose tags, legal liability, and per-site overrides; DNT/GPC enforcement suggested.
    - Ad-tech incentives drive annoyance → CMPs and TCF complexity push dark patterns; some want bans or contextual ads, others cite 3x revenue from targeted ads.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Standardize a browser-enforced consent signal (GPC+) plus mandatory cookie-purpose tagging; add simple per-site override UI.
    - Impact: Cuts banners, shifts accountability to browser vendors and ad networks, reduces small-site compliance costs, clarifies regulator audit scope.
    - Watch next: W3C spec and tests; EU/US mandates for GPC; audit Chrome’s conflicts; track banner prevalence and consent-denial metrics.
