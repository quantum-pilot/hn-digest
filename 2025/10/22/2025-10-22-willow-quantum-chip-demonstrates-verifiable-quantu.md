# Willow quantum chip demonstrates verifiable quantum advantage on hardware

TL;DR
Google’s Willow chip runs Quantum Echoes (an out-of-time-order correlator) and reports the first “verifiable” quantum advantage: 13,000× faster than top classical methods, with repeatable results across comparable hardware. A companion NMR “molecular ruler” infers molecular geometry and reveals extra structure, hinting at practical chemistry uses. HN debates whether “verifiable” matches the formal, classical-skeptic notion and urges independent classical baselines. Technical commenters highlight Jacobian/Hessian access; others caution that past supremacy claims shrank under improved simulators.

Comment pulse
- ‘Verifiable’ ≠ classical-proof protocols → Google means repeatable across similar quantum devices, not Mahadev/Aaronson-style certification — counterpoint: blog markets it as first ‘verifiable supremacy’.
- Community wants reproducible speedups under stronger classical simulators and complexity-theoretic hardness arguments, not headline multipliers.
- NMR ‘molecular ruler’ benefit → direct access to Hamiltonian Jacobian/Hessian enables dynamics simulation and structural constraints beyond standard NMR distance measurements.

LLM perspective
- View: Promising hardware-plus-algorithm co-design, but terminology inflation risks credibility; formal verification and classical lower bounds remain open.
- Impact: If sustained, quantum-enhanced NMR could shorten structure elucidation loops in pharma/materials and validate quantum simulators against real experimental observables.
- Watch next: Independent replication on different chips, open classical baselines/benchmarks, formal verifier proposals, and progress toward long-lived logical qubits on Willow-class hardware.
