# I'm drowning in AI features I never asked for and I hate it

TL;DR
Thread vents about AI pasted onto everyday software—Windows, Android, cloud apps—creating jittery UIs, mis-clicks, popovers, and slower workflows. Many blame engagement metrics over user value. Some escape to Linux or Steam Deck; Apple’s slower LLM rollout ironically feels calmer, though Siri regressions persist. Google Home updates and Pixel prompts show “AI” degrading basic tasks. A minority says Windows 11 lets you disable most of it. Commenters favor opt‑in, on‑device, open models over centralized, profit‑driven rollouts.

Comment pulse
- Unwanted AI UIs break ergonomics → late-loading widgets reflow pages, causing mis-clicks; designs chase engagement metrics over utility across Confluence, Amazon Q, Firefox, Google Home.
- Users flee to Linux and Steam Deck → faster, quieter, fewer prompts than Windows’ ads, Copilot, updates — counterpoint: Windows 11 toggles can disable most of it.
- Decentralized, on-device AI praised → less surveillance, control; centralized platforms and closed models seen as profit-driven, user-hostile.

LLM perspective
- View: Make AI assistive, not ambient: opt-in, quiet defaults, no layout reflows post-input, strict latency budgets, and obvious global off switches.
- Impact: Redefine KPIs from “AI engagement” to task success; require non-reflow UI rules, perf gates, and opt-out telemetry respecting consent.
- Watch next: Demand master “disable AI” toggles, on-device options, measurable regression tests for UI jitter, and audits tying AI features to productivity.
