# I'm drowning in AI features I never asked for and I hate it

- TL;DR
    - The author argues AI is being wedged into products as a KPI box-tick, degrading reliability and UX: Gemini replaced Assistant but got slower and less capable; Copilot feels forced into Windows; even browsers pivot to AI at the expense of polish. Generative AI also pollutes the web (botty posts, bad “AI overviews”), with models trained on scraped work and prompts harvested for profiling. HN echoes this: intrusive UI, hallucinated retail Q&A, and migrations to Linux/Steam Deck; some Apple users report fewer intrusions, though Siri regressions surface.

- Comment pulse
    - AI widgets reflow UIs and interrupt tasks → misclicks, persistent popovers (Gemini FAB, Sheets), and low-quality retail Q&A replacing human answers.
    - Users flee Windows bloat → switch to MX Linux/Fedora or Steam Deck for speed, fewer ads, and no Copilot/Edge nags.
    - Apple’s slower rollout avoids spammy AI → some praise subtlety; others say Siri regressed and Apple Intelligence is premature — counterpoint: patience for API-led evolution.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Incentives misaligned: usage KPIs and “AI adoption” optics drive intrusive placement over measurable user value and latency budgets.
    - Impact: Trust erodes in OSs, browsers, and retail; power users migrate to Linux or disable integrations, shrinking engagement metrics’ credibility.
    - Watch next: Regulatory opt-outs, UI standards against reflowing elements, dataset licensing lawsuits, and benchmarks for fast, private on-device assistants.
