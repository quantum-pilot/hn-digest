# A definition of AGI

- Score: 105 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713959) | Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212

- TL;DR
  - A new paper tries to define AGI by mapping capabilities to human psychometrics (e.g., Cattell–Horn–Carroll factors) and setting the bar at a “well‑educated adult.” HN pushes back: even child‑level generality would be epoch‑making; “well‑educated adult” is fuzzy and anthropocentric; today’s systems are jagged—superhuman in niches, weak elsewhere. Commenters debate whether we’re moving goalposts from fatigue versus acknowledging real gaps, and ask for concrete, adversarial benchmarks and safety triggers rather than abstract definitions.

- Comment pulse
  - The AGI bar is too high → Child‑level generality or animal‑level parity would be transformative — counterpoint: fatigue drives goalpost‑moving and under‑appreciation of progress.
  - “Well‑educated adult” is vague → People vary; AI already beats many adults in areas; jaggedness is universal, not disqualifying.
  - Definitions distract from safety → Capabilities emerge only after deployment; we need pre‑agreed benchmarks and alignment/risk thresholds.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Psychometric framing is useful for multidimensional evals, but anchoring to “education” bakes in cultural and temporal bias.
  - Impact: Shifts AGI from a binary label to thresholded profiles across factors; better governance hooks than vibes.
  - Watch next: Map ARC Prize/Humanity’s Last Exam to CHC factors; add robustness, transfer, and adversarial probes with policy triggers.
