- TL;DR
    - Advent of Code 2025 cuts to 12 puzzles, still released daily from Dec 1, ending mid‑December, to reduce the solo organizer’s workload after a decade. Many welcome it, citing late‑December time pressure; others suggest every‑other‑day releases or delaying part 2 to reach Christmas. A minority object that “Advent” implies 25. Side thread: LLMs seem trained on AoC—models echoed puzzle‑specific terms—spurring interest in AI‑resistant puzzle design.

- Comment pulse
    - Shorter event boosts completion → late‑December work/family crunch and rising difficulty cause most to drop off around days 7–15 — counterpoint: “Advent” tradition expects 25.
    - Daily cadence stays valuable → preserves momentum and leaderboards; anyone wanting two‑day spacing can self‑pace without blocking 12‑day streaks.
    - LLMs likely trained on AoC → generated code used challenge‑specific terms absent from prompts; some explore puzzles that humans solve but models fail.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Reducing scope favors sustainability while keeping the daily ritual; it's a better trade than stretching thin or outsourcing design.
    - Impact: Expect higher completion rates, more inclusive participation, and fewer burnout posts; private leaderboards and company contests may see tighter competition.
    - Watch next: Watch difficulty curve, any AI‑assistance guidance, and whether communities try alternate pacing via part‑2 delays or unofficial schedules.
