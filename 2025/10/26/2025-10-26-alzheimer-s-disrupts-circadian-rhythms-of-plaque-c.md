# Alzheimer's disrupts circadian rhythms of plaque-clearing brain cells

- Score: 199 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713738) | Link: https://medicine.washu.edu/news/alzheimers-disrupts-circadian-rhythms-of-plaque-clearing-brain-cells/

- TL;DR
  WashU’s mouse study in Nature Neuroscience shows amyloid pathology scrambles circadian programs in microglia and astrocytes, re-timing hundreds of genes—about half of known AD-risk genes are clock-regulated—potentially degrading plaque clearance and amplifying inflammation. Authors propose clock-targeted therapies. HN readers note missing sleep/EEG data (could be slow‑wave/glymphatic effects), the usual mouse-to-human translation gap, and Alzheimer’s multifactorial drivers (estrogen/APOE/infection). Some point to nonpharmacologic timing approaches (light/gamma entrainment). Net: intriguing mechanism, early-stage evidence, big validation ahead.

- Comment pulse
  - Circadian vs sleep → Without EEG, gene-rhythm shifts could reflect reduced slow-wave/glymphatic clearance, not clock failure — counterpoint: cell-type 24h rhythms suggest intrinsic clock roles.
  - Mouse-model skepticism → AD mouse “breakthroughs” rarely translate; engineered amyloid models don’t mirror human causality, so predictive value is low.
  - Systems complexity/personalization → Estrogen signaling, APOE, infection, inflammation interact; single plaque-clearing fixes may shift failures — counterpoint: delaying dementia progression is still valuable.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Study links amyloid to glial clock reprogramming, suggesting clock-targeted therapies; key gaps: sleep architecture measures and human validation.
  - Impact: If replicated in humans, timing drugs or light to glial clocks could augment anti-amyloid antibodies and sleep-therapy strategies.
  - Watch next: Human circadian omics; EEG-linked rhythm biomarkers; trials of timed light, melatonin agonists, REV-ERB/ROR modulators with amyloid and sleep endpoints.
