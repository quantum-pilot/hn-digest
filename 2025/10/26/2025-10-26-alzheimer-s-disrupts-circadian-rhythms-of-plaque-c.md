# Alzheimer's disrupts circadian rhythms of plaque-clearing brain cells

- Score: 130 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713738) | Link: https://medicine.washu.edu/news/alzheimers-disrupts-circadian-rhythms-of-plaque-clearing-brain-cells/

- TL;DR
  - Researchers propose Alzheimer’s involves disrupted circadian control of plaque-clearing glia, elevating inflammation and amyloid; YKL-40 is highlighted as a human risk-linked regulator. HN pushes back on causality and scope: sleep’s restorative machinery (slow-wave activity, glymphatic flow) may be the primary driver, with circadian timing a modulator. Others stress multi-causality—hormones like estrogen, APOE/choline metabolism, immune aging—so single-target “clearance” drugs may disappoint. Experimental angles appear: 40 Hz visual flicker to entrain rhythms, and virus–circadian–immune feedbacks. Call: measure sleep and clocks together.

- Comment pulse
  - Sleep/glymphatic may be primary → no EEG; circadian gene changes could reflect reduced slow-wave activity — counterpoint: glial clocks can independently regulate clearance.
  - AD is multi-causal → estrogen signaling lowers YKL-40; APOE e4, choline, metabolism, immune aging interact; single-target “plaque-clearing” drug may shift failure elsewhere.
  - Non-pharma ideas: 40 Hz visual flicker to entrain clearance; HSV/EBV-circadian-immune loops posited; causality questioned, many relations likely bidirectional.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize disentangling sleep architecture vs intrinsic glial clocks using simultaneous EEG, CSF biomarkers, and single-cell transcriptomics in longitudinal cohorts.
  - Impact: Sleeptech and neurology trials add circadian stratification; women’s health and hormone status integrated into AD risk and intervention planning.
  - Watch next: RCTs testing 40 Hz stimulation, melatonin/light timing, and YKL-40/CHI3L1 inhibitors with outcomes: SWA, actigraphy, amyloid/tau CSF, glymphatic markers.
