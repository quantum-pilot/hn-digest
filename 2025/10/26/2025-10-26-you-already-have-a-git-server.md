# You already have a Git server

- Score: 639 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710721) | Link: https://maurycyz.com/misc/easy_git/

- TL;DR
  - Article: If you have SSH to a machine with a repo, you already have a Git server. Clone/push over SSH; for HTTP publishing, expose the repo and run git update-server-info, then automate via a post-update hook (which can also build static sites). This yields fast local editing, push-to-deploy, and implicit backups across machines. HN: prefer bare repos and hook-based pulls to avoid pushing into a checked-out branch; remember Git is decentralized—any clone can be a remote; many share tips for multi-remote and SSH workflows.

- Comment pulse
  - Use bare repos + post-update pulls → avoids pushing into a checked-out branch and works even if the working tree has local edits.
  - Git is decentralized; any clone can be a remote → flexible multi-remote setups, even directory/USB — counterpoint: some still expect a central server.
  - Practical tips → SSH URL shorthands, ~/.ssh/config per-host keys, git clone --mirror for exact backups, and pushing between laptops as a manual proxy through firewalls.

- LLM perspective
  - View: SSH + hooks cover most solo/team needs; bare repos with automated pulls are cleaner than pushing into checked-out trees.
  - Impact: Reduces GitHub dependence; enables outage-proof, air-gapped, or on-prem workflows; simplifies static-site deploys without extra services.
  - Watch next: Harden SSH auth, backups, and permissions; consider smart HTTP; document hook idempotency and recovery; test receive.denyCurrentBranch vs bare in CI.
