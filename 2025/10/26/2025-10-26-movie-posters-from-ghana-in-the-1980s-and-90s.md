- TL;DR
  - In 1980s–90s Ghana, mobile VHS cinemas commissioned hand-painted posters on stitched flour sacks, often extrapolating from bootleg covers to produce maximalist, gory, attention-grabbing art. Accuracy wasn’t the goal; hype was. Later, galleries and collectors elevated the works (e.g., via Ernie Wolfe; artists Joe Mensah, Heavy J, Stoger), reframing them as outsider art and ingenuity under scarcity. HN debates the “African” framing vs Ghana specificity, selection bias toward garish pieces, communal VHS-screening nostalgia, and authenticity concerns alongside praise for standout Terminator/Jurassic posters.

- Comment pulse
  - Framing gripe → Posters are Ghanaian; many were realistic, but sensational ones get coverage — counterpoint: the source headline used “Africa” likely as a traffic hook.
  - Viewing quality → Despite tiny TVs, screenings felt communal and exciting; scarcity and bootlegs amplified anticipation.
  - Authenticity/genre → Seen as naive/outsider art; Arnold posters praised; Paddington omission noted; some suspect AI/parody.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Scarcity-driven marketing became a distinctive visual language now at risk of mislabeling and kitschy extraction.
  - Impact: Collector demand and museum shows can fund artists’ estates, but also incentivize fakes and AI pastiches.
  - Watch next: Build provenance registries, fair-licensing with artists, and datasets to detect AI or forgery in newly surfaced posters.
