- TL;DR
  - Hand-painted Ghanaian movie posters from the 1980s–90s marketed traveling cinemas and video clubs, mixing realism with hyperbolic “naive” reinterpretations that now attract collectors. A Ghanaian commenter describes quick, wall-sized work and notes many posters were realistic—garish ones get attention. Discussion debates calling them “African” versus Ghana-specific; whether TV “screenings” were inferior versus communal and nostalgic; and celebrates inventive takes on Hollywood icons. Some note Ghanaian films trending on streaming and a per‑capita output brag compared to Nigeria.

- Comment pulse
  - Use Ghanaian, not generic African → specificity respects context; many posters were realistic; artists could finish wall pieces in hours.
  - TV screenings were poor substitutes for theaters → small screens underwhelm — counterpoint: communal vibe, VHS nostalgia, and bootleg scarcity made experiences memorable.
  - Hollywood reimagined (Arnold, Terminator, Jurassic, Paddington) → exuberant, sometimes absurd; several are legitimately skilled compositions.
