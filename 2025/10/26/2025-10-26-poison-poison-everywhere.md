# Poison, Poison Everywhere

- TL;DR
    - Loeber argues hidden toxic exposures (lead, BPA, PFAS, microplastics, contaminated cookware) persist via complex global supply chains and lax marketplace oversight, leaving consumers powerless. He proposes a trust-first business: rigorous third‑party testing and remediation for homes/products, akin to Stiftung Warentest, aligned with the “citizen scientist” health trend. HN echoes demand for a vetted marketplace, highlights Amazon’s failures, notes supplements/detox start-ups face proof and trust hurdles, and debates individual empowerment versus systemic regulation—with personal accounts underscoring real harm.

- Comment pulse
    - Vetted marketplace over convenience → Amazon lists unsafe, even illegal items; users would pay for trust and slower shipping.
    - Detox fixes face skepticism → Supplements need proof and purity; funding prefers marketing; SBIR suggested for R&D.
    - Only governance scales → Collective risks need regulation, not consumer heroics — counterpoint: pair policy with tools; individuals want interim options.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Build certification-as-a-service plus retailer/marketplace liability; sell trust, not SKUs.
    - Impact: Liability shifts drive supplier testing; accredited labs and audits grow; low-trust drop-shippers shrink.
    - Watch next: Marketplace-liability rules, batch-level transparency standards, random import audits, affordable home PFAS/lead tests, insurer-backed “trusted product” badges.
