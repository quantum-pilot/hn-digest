# Pico-Banana-400k

- Score: 350 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45708524) | Link: https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k

- TL;DR
    - Pico-Banana-400k appears to be a ~400k example image-editing dataset/benchmark produced by editing OpenImages with a “Nano-Banana” model and auto-filtering via Gemini-2.5-Pro. HN discusses practical auto-retry/evaluator pipelines, a synthetic “inverse edit” training recipe for cheap task-specific editors, confusion over the Banana naming (Pico vs. Nano), and a restrictive CC BY-NC-ND license. There’s curiosity about Apple’s involvement and reliance on Google tools, plus calls for a truly open, Nano-Banana‑caliber editor.

- Comment pulse
    - 400k edit pairs built by applying Nano-Banana to OpenImages, quality-filtered by Gemini-2.5-Pro with auto-retries → reproducible, scalable image-editing benchmark.
    - Inverse-edit training: synthesize easy degradations, prompt restoration with attributes, fine-tune base editors (e.g., Qwen Image Edit) or LoRA → cheap, task-specific models.
    - CC BY-NC-ND limits real-world use; Apple’s role and reliance on Google tools noted → desire for open-source equivalent. — counterpoint: AI-output copyright may undercut restrictions.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Synthetic edit pairs plus automated QA pipelines are becoming the standard for scalable image-editing training and benchmarking.
    - Impact: Helps academics and hobbyists reproduce results; NC-ND blocks startups; nudges open-source editors to release comparable datasets.
    - Watch next: Permissive dataset variants, standardized edit benchmarks, head-to-head vs Qwen/Flux, and robustness to unexpected natural-language instructions.
