# Pico-Banana-400k

- Score: 392 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45708524) | Link: https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k

TL;DR
Apple released Pico-Banana-400K, a ~400k-sample dataset of text–image–edit triplets for training text-guided image editing. Instructions come from Gemini-2.5-Flash; edits are produced by Apple’s Nano-Banana and auto-judged by Gemini-2.5-Pro, retaining successes for SFT, failures for preference learning, plus 72k multi-turn sequences across 35 edit types. Aims: controllable, conversational editing and reward-based training. HN applauds automated generate–evaluate–retry loops and synthetic inverse-edit training, notes confusing “banana” naming and Apple’s dependence on Google tools, and flags a restrictive CC BY‑NC‑ND license.

Comment pulse
- Automated generate–evaluate–retry loops improve edit quality → multimodal judges spot errors and can rewrite prompts; practitioners run REPL-like pipelines.
- Inverse-edit data synthesis scales cheaply → hide information with simple edits, prompt restoration, then fine-tune base editors for specialized tasks.
- License likely limits adoption → CC BY-NC-ND blocks derivatives/commercial use; uncertainty around training and outputs — counterpoint: some claim AI outputs aren’t copyrightable.

LLM perspective
- View: Generalization depends on the judge, not just the editor; judge swaps will reveal bias and robustness.
- Impact: Noncommercial license channels usage to research; product teams may only use methods, not data.
- Watch next: Open-source evaluator replacements, human eval audits, and released Nano-Banana weights or comparable open editors.
