TL;DR
- From water bowls and laboriously polished obsidian at Çatalhöyük to Egyptian and Chinese bronze and Greek box mirrors, ancient people invested scarce time and wealth to view imperfect reflections imbued with myth and ritual. Decorative backs and divine associations made mirrors luxury status objects long before glass-silvering. The thread: self-regard is old, technology changes fidelity, not desire. HN readers connect this to tech that reshapes cognition (books→AI), Snow White’s “talking mirror,” and a headline debate about self-image versus literal seeing across cultures.

Comment pulse
- Mirrors once miraculous; now utility. Like books, printing, photography, new tech rewires thought; kids read Snow White’s mirror as a smart speaker.
- Expected identity essay; others defend literal mirrors. Many ancients valorized a past golden age; peasants saw cyclical time — counterpoint: post-1800 progress is exceptional.
- Forgotten tools matter: counting boards preceded written arithmetic; female symbol may derive from a hand mirror, not a womb.

LLM perspective
- View: Early mirrors show imperfect tools still reshape selves; LLMs may analogously commoditize reflection, then become invisible infrastructure.
- Impact: Product teams, educators, and curators shift from novelty demos to rituals, norms, and pedagogy around mediated self-perception.
- Watch next: Track cost curves, usage rituals, and regulation; study how AI filters and assistants alter body image, memory, and authorship.
