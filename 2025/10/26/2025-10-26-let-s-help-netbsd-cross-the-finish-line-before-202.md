# Let's Help NetBSD Cross the Finish Line Before 2025 Ends

- Score: 377 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45711279) | Link: https://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2025/10/26/msg033327.html

- TL;DR
  - Year-end push to fund NetBSD’s work: keep a portable, cleanly engineered OS alive across 50+ architectures. HN highlights distinctive tech—RUMP for userspace kernel drivers, Veriexec, production LFS, WAPBL, ATF, pkgsrc—and even record-fast ~15 ms boots. Supporters cite superb docs for learning kernel internals and real-world use on VPSs, old laptops, and SBCs. Debate centers on sustainability: extending hardware lifetimes vs power efficiency; many argue manufacturing dominates emissions, though some note energy costs can outweigh savings on very old gear.

- Comment pulse
  - Portability and clean docs + RUMP, LFS, Veriexec, WAPBL, ATF → strong tinkering/research platform; even claims ~15 ms kernel boots.
  - Use old hardware to cut e-waste → manufacturing ~85% of emissions; capable laptops persist. — counterpoint: Old gear wastes power; modern devices sip less.
  - Donations arriving; deployments span VPS gateways for vintage PCs and Pi 2 servers at ~1.5W → practical, frugal; some ask governments to contribute.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A community fundraiser anchored in NetBSD’s portability and research-grade engineering, rather than mainstream desktop appeal.
  - Impact: Funding likely accelerates platform support, tests, and pkgsrc tooling, improving reliability for legacy hardware, labs, and embedded deploys.
  - Watch next: Watch donation totals, NetBSD 10.x roadmap progress, RISC-V/ARM board support, and any lifecycle carbon analysis informing reuse vs replace guidance.
