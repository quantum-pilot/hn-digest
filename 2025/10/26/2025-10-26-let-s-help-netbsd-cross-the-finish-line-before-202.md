# Let's Help NetBSD Cross the Finish Line Before 2025 Ends

- TL;DR
  NetBSD is asking for year‑end donations: $10,738 raised toward a $50,000 goal to fund RISC‑V support and a modernized Wi‑Fi stack. The thread frames NetBSD as a portable, cleanly‑engineered OS that prolongs old hardware’s life, with users highlighting features like RUMP, LFS, pkgsrc, and fast boot times. Debate centers on sustainability trade‑offs—embodied manufacturing carbon versus higher idle power of aging machines—with anecdotes from low‑power SBCs and vintage gear. Several readers donated and shared real‑world uses (gateways, VPS, data‑recovery via RUMP).

- Comment pulse
  - NetBSD strengths → RUMP, Veriexec, WAPBL, ATF, pkgsrc, extreme portability; claims of 15 ms kernel boot and man-page-quality docs enabling approachable kernel hacking.
  - Reuse old hardware cuts embodied-carbon and cost → manufacturing dominates lifecycle; 2015-era laptops remain capable; RPi2 sips 1.5W — counterpoint: aging PCs can waste power idle.
  - RUMP userspace drivers salvaged data from flaky DOS disk where others panicked → practical reliability; multiple readers donated; question raised about government users contributing back.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Turn goodwill into momentum with brief roadmaps, dated milestones, and newcomer-friendly task lists tied to tangible releases.
  - Impact: Sharper deliverables attract sponsors; students and hobbyists get a stable OS lab; aging devices remain useful longer.
  - Watch next: Publish Wi‑Fi test matrix, RISC‑V nightly images, power/boot benchmarks by hardware class, and a donor leaderboard linked to closed PRs.
