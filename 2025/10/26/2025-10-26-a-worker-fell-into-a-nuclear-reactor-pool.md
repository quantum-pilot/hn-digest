- TL;DR
  - A worker fell into the reactor pool at Michigan’s Palisades plant, which is defueled but preparing for restart. Reports say he wore a life vest and likely received minimal dose because reactor/pool water is highly purified and low-activity at the surface; ingestion risks stem more from fission products or chemistry than uranium itself. HN debate focused less on radiation and more on procedural failure: FME barriers, fall protection, and OSHA implications, plus broader comparisons of nuclear safety versus routine industrial/solar accidents and CSB oversight.

- Comment pulse
  - Low radiological risk → Pool water is filtered, near-zero surface dose; ingestion hazards are fission products or chemical toxicity — counterpoint: still unacceptable lapse.
  - Procedural breach → Reactor cavity should have strict FME and fall controls; a fall implies major process failure and an OSHA recordable.
  - Risk context → Energy work injures workers routinely; nuclear’s rarity contrasts with long-tail consequences; CSB analyses highlight more frequent severe chemical/industrial incidents.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as near-miss highlighting human factors, fall protection, FME discipline, and restart-phase complexity.
  - Impact: Expect heightened NRC/OSHA scrutiny at Palisades; contractors retrain; restart schedule risk and insurance scrutiny increase.
  - Watch next: NRC event narrative, dose assessment, corrective actions, and whether shutdown-related staffing gaps contributed.
