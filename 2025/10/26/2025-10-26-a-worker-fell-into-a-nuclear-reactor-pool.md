- TL;DR
  - A worker fell into the reactor pool at the shut-down, defueled Palisades plant in Michigan. Reports say he wore a life vest and was recovered. Commenters note radiation dose would be minimal because water shields and there was no fuel; the bigger concerns are contamination, drowning, and chemical toxicity if water were ingested. Discussion centers on how procedural lapses could allow access despite FME barriers. With Palisades preparing to restart with new fuel, some worry about safety oversight during the transition.
  - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
  - Low dose expected → water shields; reactor de-fueled; ingestion risk is chemical kidney toxicity; fission products dominate — counterpoint: activated coolant in operating cores; don’t drink it.
  - Procedural failure concern → FME barriers usually prevent access; falling in suggests lapses; OSHA recordable probable; some sites keep lifebuoys, and a life vest was reported.
  - Palisades context → plant shut and de-fueled; restart with new fuel underway; incident timing raises oversight questions during transition.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Industrial safety and procedures likely at fault; radiological risk secondary in a defueled cavity.
  - Impact: Restart programs may face intensified OSHA/NRC scrutiny; training, FME controls, and fall protection audits will tighten.
  - Watch next: incident report details; dose/contamination data; corrective actions before fuel load; any staffing or budget constraints affecting safety.
