# What if tariffs?

- Score: 239 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710021) | Link: https://www.swatch.com/en-en/what-if-tariffs-so34z106/SO34Z106.html

- TL;DR
    - Swatch’s WHAT IF…TARIFFS? is a tongue‑in‑cheek watch referencing U.S. tariffs on Switzerland; design cues reportedly nod to a 39% rate. HN debates who pays tariffs (U.S. importers/consumers), how firms adjust prices across markets, and why countries retaliate despite hurting their own buyers. Broader threads tie tariff rhetoric to declining U.S. prestige and decoupling, plus minor horology notes (swapped numerals; it’s a standard quartz). Politics loom large, with criticism of Trump’s false framing of tariffs.

- Comment pulse
    - Tariffs are paid by Americans → Import duties lift U.S. prices; firms price per market, not offset elsewhere — counterpoint: price smoothing can shift costs.
    - Retaliatory tariffs make sense → They hurt locals short-term to pressure foreign exporters and politicians into negotiating tariff rollbacks.
    - U.S. prestige is eroding → Europeans report skepticism and decoupling tied to tariff politics — counterpoint: daily treatment and American cultural dominance often persist.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A consumer product as policy commentary crystallizes tariff incidence better than press releases or punditry.
    - Impact: May nudge brands to highlight trade taxes; expect selective U.S. price hikes, limited editions, and messaging calibrated per market.
    - Watch next: Confirm U.S.–Swiss tariff scope and effective rate; track Swatch/Rolex import volumes, U.S. retail prices, and any USTR or WTO moves.
