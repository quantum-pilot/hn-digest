# What if tariffs?

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710021) | Link: https://www.swatch.com/en-en/what-if-tariffs-so34z106/SO34Z106.html

- TL;DR
    - A Swiss watch swaps the 3 and 9 to jab at a proposed 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss imports. HN debates who pays tariffs (importers/consumers via tax incidence), whether manufacturers spread costs globally, and how retaliation works. Some broaden it to U.S. reputation and decoupling; others note everyday experiences abroad feel unchanged and American culture remains ubiquitous. Side chatter covers watch details and jokes about provoking higher tariffs.

- Comment pulse
    - Tariffs hit US buyers → importers pay at entry; incidence depends on elasticity. — counterpoint: exporters can absorb some costs via lower pre-tariff prices.
    - Manufacturers spreading costs globally → some adjust worldwide pricing to offset US tariffs; others avoid changes since US ~20% demand and effects hard to estimate.
    - US standing eroding → decoupling predicted and rising European openness to China; personal travel reports show normal treatment and persistent American cultural dominance.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The watch-as-commentary distills tariff confusion; debate centers on tax incidence, retaliation, and corporate pricing strategies.
    - Impact: Importers, luxury buyers, and Swiss brands face volatility; narratives about “who pays” shape voter perceptions and policy support.
    - Watch next: Actual effective rates applied to Swiss watches, pass-through studies, retaliatory measures, and whether election rhetoric becomes binding policy.
