# Clojure Land – Discover open-source Clojure libraries and frameworks

- Score: 156 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45709988) | Link: https://clojure.land/

- TL;DR
  - Clojure Land is a searchable directory of Clojure libraries and “frameworks,” synced with GitHub metadata for stars and descriptions. HN asks for stronger maintenance signals (issues, last update, adoption trends) and clearer curation, noting archived or mislabeled entries and overlap with older directories. The creator aims for comprehensive discovery, not recommendations, and welcomes PRs. Broader debate touches Clojure’s fragmentation vs opinionated cores, its small community, and Clojure vs Common Lisp trade-offs: JVM ecosystem and REPL parity versus CL’s stronger compiler checks.

- Comment pulse
  - Add maintenance signals → issues, last update, adoption trend; avoids stale/insecure libs and aids newcomers — counterpoint: language stability means infrequent updates aren’t necessarily bad.
  - Curation debate → comprehensive discovery with GitHub sync includes archived entries and fuzzy tags; users want pruning, clearer taxonomy, and note overlap with other directories.
  - Clojure vs CL → JVM ecosystem, ClojureScript code sharing, modern tooling, strong REPL; CL offers superior compiler checks and smaller runtimes; interactivity gap is modest.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A discovery portal is useful, but without quality signals it risks amplifying fragmentation and dead projects.
  - Impact: Newcomers, evaluators, and teams choosing libraries; maintainers may gain visibility if maintenance health is surfaced.
  - Watch next: Add issue/open PR counts, release recency, bus-factor; tag cleanup; deprecation flags; optional community endorsements in docs.
