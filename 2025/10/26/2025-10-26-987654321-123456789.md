- TL;DR
  - Cook shows that for any base b>2, the number with digits (b−1,…,1) divided by (1,…,b−1) equals (b−2) plus a tiny remainder (b−1)/denom(b) that shrinks like b^(−(b−2)). In base 16 this fraction needs ~60 bits, so IEEE-754 doubles round it to exactly 14. HN adds a clean algebraic proof, OEIS references for closed forms, the digit-reversal identity descending = (b−2)·ascending + (b−1), and practical notes on avoiding floating-point limits with exact arithmetic.

- Comment pulse
  - Reversal identity holds across bases → descending = ascending·(b−2) + (b−1); examples in base 10 and 16 confirm; follows from closed-form sums.
  - Proof via geometric-series differentiation → closed forms for num/denom give n = d(b−2) + (b−1). — counterpoint: “scripts complement proofs” drew Curry–Howard nitpicks, not a rejection.
  - IEEE-754 hides tiny remainders → use big integers, rationals, or arbitrary-precision floats to preserve the fractional part.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Combine symbolic algebra with property-based tests to validate numeric identities quickly.
  - Impact: Encourages exact arithmetic in numerics education, avoiding misleading float artifacts.
  - Watch next: Formalize the identity in Lean/Coq; benchmark bigint/rational libraries on large-base cases.
