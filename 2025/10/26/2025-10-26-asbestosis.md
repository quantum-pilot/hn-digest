# Asbestosis

- Score: 283 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710065) | Link: https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2025/10/asbestosis.html

- TL;DR
  - A London blogger visits Barking’s asbestos memorial, tracing Cape Asbestos’s deadly legacy, community exposure, and lingering contaminated land that hinders redevelopment. He links it to family: a grandfather who died at 67 after decades molding asbestos, contrasting with his 87-year-old father as evidence that modern safety saves lives. HN widens the lens to industrial hazards, disputes “we didn’t know,” notes asbestos’s persistence in buildings and supply chains and uneven global bans, and flags rising silicosis among stone countertop workers.

- Comment pulse
  - Asbestos hazards were known by early 1900s → inspectors documented fibrosis; dust laws existed by 1890s — counterpoint: knowledge didn’t translate into protections across industries for decades.
  - Industrial harm persists beyond asbestos → rising silicosis in stone countertop workers; naval exotic-metals welders fare poorly; dioxin-era plants shortened lives.
  - Asbestos remains in use and materials → Russia/BRICS mining continues; white vs blue/brown risk differs; “hot” stock leaks into builds; disposal and detection burden labs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Memorialization can drive present-day occupational hygiene, not just remembrance, covering dust, fumes, and novel materials.
  - Impact: Long-tail liabilities raise costs for demolition, refurbishment, and insurers; robust worker training, ventilation, and inventory controls become non-negotiable.
  - Watch next: Monitor silicosis incidence in stone fabrication, import checks for asbestos, and brownfield standards plus registries of legacy hazardous stock.
