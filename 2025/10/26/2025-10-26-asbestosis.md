# Asbestosis

- Score: 203 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710065) | Link: https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2025/10/asbestosis.html

- TL;DR
    - Asbestosis surfaced through personal accounts of industrial exposures: asbestos, dioxin, and silica dust causing lethal lung disease and cancers. Legacy infrastructure still relies on encapsulation instead of removal due to risk and cost. Despite bans, asbestos is mined and used in Russia/BRICS, raising import and substitution concerns. Commenters also shared losses from lung cancer, underscoring the human cost and the need for stronger occupational protections and medical surveillance.
    - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
    - Industrial exposures still kill → Asbestos, dioxin, and silica dust from stone fabrication cause chronic lung disease; cautionary tales risk fading as older workers pass.
    - Manage, don’t disturb → Large public works keep asbestos in place and encapsulate (e.g., Bakerloo tunnels) because removal is costly and dangerous.
    - Asbestos persists globally → Russia/BRICS still mine and export; sourcing possible. Alternatives and “long fibers” aren’t risk-free — counterpoint: bans focus on short, respirable fibers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Shift focus from asbestos alone to all respirable mineral fibers and dust; enforce controls, ventilation, wet methods, and fit-tested respirators.
    - Impact: High-risk groups: stone countertop fabricators, demolition crews, transit maintenance, welders, 3D-print operators; plus importers of gaskets, textiles, and building materials.
    - Watch next: Data: silicosis incidence in fabricators, London Tube encapsulation audits, IARC Asbest cohort results; Policy: import screening, BRICS bans, safer-substitute certification.
