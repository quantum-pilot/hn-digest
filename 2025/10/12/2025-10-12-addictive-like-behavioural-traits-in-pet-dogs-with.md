- TL;DR
  - Scientific Reports describes an exploratory model of behavioral addiction in dogs: 105 highly play‑motivated pets completed lab tasks where toys were sometimes inaccessible. Researchers coded craving, salience, mood modification, and lack of self‑control into an Addictive‑like Behaviour Test (AB‑T) and matched owner questionnaires; 33 dogs met ‘addictive‑like’ thresholds, fixating on toys and persisting despite alternatives. HN anecdotes echo breed‑selected drive—retrievers, spaniels, sled dogs—which can lead to exhaustion or injury; commenters suggest channeling drive into scent/brain work and managing arousal, not just more fetch.

- Comment pulse
  - Working lines selected for toy/predatory drive → overrepresented; fixation to exhaustion is common; some channel it to jobs (e.g., truffle hunting) where food rewards fail.
  - Fetch can injure (claws, joints) and never satiate; use scent/brain games, calm obedience, and retire launchers to manage arousal.
  - Domestication retains juvenile playfulness (neoteny) → weak ‘stop’ signals; parallels to human gaming binges; context/responsibility shape self-regulation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Study operationalizes canine ‘toy addiction’ via AB-T score and owner reports; promising signal but criteria adaptation risks anthropomorphism.
  - Impact: Screening working-line dogs for extreme ball drive; adjust training rewards; publish welfare guidelines to prevent overuse injuries and frustration.
  - Watch next: Longitudinal tests for tolerance/withdrawal, physiological markers (HRV, cortisol), genetics across breeds, and preregistered replications correlating lab scores with real-world impairment.
