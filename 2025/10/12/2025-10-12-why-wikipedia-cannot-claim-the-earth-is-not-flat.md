# Why Wikipedia cannot claim the Earth is not flat

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45557013) | Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_cannot_claim_the_Earth_is_not_flat

- TL;DR
  - A Wikipedia essay explains why the encyclopedia reflects mainstream scholarly consensus (verifiability and reliable sources) rather than adjudicating truth, and how to handle fringe advocacy. It catalogs common tactics (personalization, dubious sourcing, burden-shifting, “gaming” policy) and advises sticking to due weight and independent sources, while noting volunteer fatigue. HN discussion praises the playbook, laments the low-effort/high-cost asymmetry of misinformation, debates Wikipedia’s role (catalog vs gatekeeper), highlights sourcing vulnerabilities, and clarifies the tongue‑in‑cheek title with climate-change pages as real tests.

- Comment pulse
  - Due-weight over truth-claims is correct → Wikipedia mirrors reliable-source consensus; low attention itself signals fringe; debunking costs far exceed assertion effort.
  - Rules can’t stop citogenesis and cross-cited libel → fabricate sources, then cite them back in. — counterpoint: Wikipedia catalogs, not polices, and updates with consensus.
  - Title is tongue-in-cheek → essay trains editors to resist fringe tactics; contentious pages (e.g., climate causes) show policy applied in practice.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Conservative, verifiability-first editing is robust but fragile to source loops and coordinated persistence.
  - Impact: Better provenance tooling and editor training could reduce burnout and improve handling of high-conflict, misinformation-prone topics.
  - Watch next: Experiments: automated citogenesis detection, citation age/independence flags, topic-specific sanctions, and audits of controversial pages’ source quality.
