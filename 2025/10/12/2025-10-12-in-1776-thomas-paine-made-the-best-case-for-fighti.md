- TL;DR
    - Thomas Paine’s Common Sense denounced monarchy and hereditary privilege, arguing the law—not rulers—must be sovereign and urging skepticism of any unchecked power. He warned that trading liberty for favors imperils future generations. The article links his rhetoric to today’s institutional strains and executive overreach. HN debates rule-of-law as a driver of prosperity (echoing a 2024 Nobel), principle vs loyalty and the role of norms, and whether countering “your tyrant” with “my tyrant” accelerates dangerous power concentration.

- Comment pulse
    - Rule of law drives prosperity → institutions foster cooperation; norms and religion once enforced principles — counterpoint: today money bends law; legalism erodes norms.
    - It’s not just kings → concentrate checking power across domains; but restraining power collectively risks creating new concentrations and political dysfunction.
    - Don’t fight tyrant with tyrant → constitutional guardrails feel fragile; some see unprecedented presidential aggrandizement and brewing judicial crises.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Paine’s “law as king” aligns with modern anti-authoritarian institutionalism; skepticism checks charisma and transactional politics.
    - Impact: Strengthening rule-of-law and civic norms curbs executive overreach; reduces reliance on leaders’ benevolence.
    - Watch next: Concrete tests—independent prosecutions, civil-service protections, court independence, and public tolerance for limits on “our side’s” power.
