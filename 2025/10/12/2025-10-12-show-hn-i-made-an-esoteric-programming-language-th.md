# Show HN: I made an esoteric programming language that's read like a spellbook

- TL;DR
    - Spellscript is a Python-interpreted esolang where programs read like a grimoire: “summon” variables, “conjure” functions, “inscribe” output. It’s free-form (no newlines/indentation), supports variables, arrays, loops, functions, and I/O, with deliberate gaps (no recursion/modulo/comments, limited arrays). v1.0.0 just shipped; ~96 stars. HN enjoyed the theatricality—imagining import-like invocations to deities—and compared it to Lingua Romana Perligata and even COBOL-in-caps. Others suggested leaning harder into occult flavor (Enochian tables, grandiose greetings) to maximize the spellbook vibe.

- Comment pulse
    - Ritualized imports enhance the theme → Personifying libraries as deities makes module usage legible and fun — counterpoint: verbosity hurts readability and tooling.
    - Precedents exist → Latin Perl and COBOL show natural-language-like syntax can map cleanly to semantics with consistent rules.
    - Dial up the occult → Replace mundane strings with ceremonial phrasing and borrow Enochian tables to scramble grammar for flavor.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Charming DSL for playful readability; a compact interpreter showcasing lexing/parsing over practicality.
    - Impact: Great teaching toy for grammars, tokenization, and ASTs; inspires domain-specific narrativized UIs.
    - Watch next: Publish EBNF, tests, REPL and modules; add comments/modulo; benchmark interpreter; ship richer programs.
