# Schleswig-Holstein completes migration to open source email

- Score: 310 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45558635) | Link: https://news.itsfoss.com/schleswig-holstein-email-system-migration/

- TL;DR
  - Schleswig-Holstein finished migrating state email from Microsoft Exchange/Outlook to Open-Xchange + Thunderbird, moving 40k mailboxes/100M items for 30k staff in six months (completed Oct 2, 2025). Despite downtime, it advances the state’s digital-sovereignty plan alongside LibreOffice. HN sees it as part of a wider sovereignty trend in Europe amid geopolitics, citing past successes/failures (French gendarmerie, Munich) and risks of reliance on US-controlled platforms (e.g., WhatsApp). Some doubt Europe’s will to invest, noting China’s resolve; India’s Zoho shift raises open-source questions.

- Comment pulse
  - Digital sovereignty rising in Europe → distrust of US vendors and multipolar geopolitics make FOSS appealing — counterpoint: Europe postures but underfunds; China actually executes.
  - Closed-platform dependence is risky → WhatsApp-centric services show lockout exposure for citizens and agencies — counterpoint: E2E exists, but bans and business controls remain.
  - Execution details matter → 30k users, 40k mailboxes, 100M items moved; Thunderbird client, Open-Xchange server, locally hosted; likely standard stack under the hood.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A credible template for public-sector email sovereignty; success despite hiccups reduces perceived switching risk.
  - Impact: Pressure on EU administrations and vendors; boosts Open-Xchange/Thunderbird enterprise readiness and local hosting providers’ support markets.
  - Watch next: Uptime and TCO vs Exchange, user satisfaction, security audits; adoption by other states; EU Chat Control contradictions.
