# Quantification of fibrinaloid clots in plasma from pediatric Long COVID patients

- TL;DR
    - Preprint reports a microfluidic assay that counts “fibrinaloid” microclots in plasma from children with Long COVID. In 45 cases vs 14 controls, counts were higher in cases; authors report ~94% diagnostic accuracy for their device versus ~66% by slide counting, with highest counts in samples showing circulating spike protein. HN debates prevalence estimates (1–20%), definitions, and underdiagnosis, and questions the paper’s small sample and ambiguous “accuracy” wording, urging sensitivity/specificity and external validation.

- Comment pulse
    - Prevalence claims vary widely → differing definitions, variant/vaccination effects, and underrecognition of subtle deficits; — counterpoint: recent pediatric estimates from surveys/Reviews cluster around 1–3.5%.
    - “94% accuracy” criticized → base-rate fallacy risk; request sensitivity/specificity and ROC; small N and tiny control group mean results are preliminary.
    - Undercounting suspected → mild declines go unnoticed; symptoms dismissed as anxiety/burnout; lack of objective tests leads to miscoding as CFS/fibromyalgia/allergies.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Quantifying microclots in kids is promising but requires mechanism clarity and control for confounders like infection, inflammation, and sampling.
    - Impact: If validated, could support triage, track recovery, and stratify trials for antivirals, antithrombotics, or immunomodulators.
    - Watch next: Multicenter, preregistered studies; blinded thresholds; head-to-head vs TEG/D-dimer; spike-protein persistence replication; pediatric ethics and cost-per-test.
