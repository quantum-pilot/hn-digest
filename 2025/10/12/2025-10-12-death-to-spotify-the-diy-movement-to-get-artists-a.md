- TL;DR
  - Guardian reports a DIY Death to Spotify push—panels, boycotts, and Liz Pelly’s Mood Machine—urging artists and listeners to leave Spotify over tiny payouts, algorithm-driven passive listening, and CEO Daniel Ek’s military‑AI investment. Some artists now sell direct (Bandcamp, vinyl, Twitch) or self‑host, arguing Spotify visibility no longer pays. HN debates feasibility: label control, pro‑rata vs user‑centric payouts, and ownership/discoverability trade‑offs; UMAW backs collective pressure and legislation to raise streaming royalties.

- Comment pulse
  - Opt‑out is naive → labels gatekeep rights and pro‑rata favors megastars. User‑centric splits pay what subscribers play — counterpoint: Spotify pays ~70% to rights holders.
  - Discoverability vs ownership → streaming offers breadth and ease; Bandcamp/self‑hosting (e.g., Navidrome) pay artists more but require effort; last.fm once filled discovery gaps.
  - Spotify nudges passive listening → UI favors playlists, bundles podcasts/audiobooks; some allege intentionally poor library UX and rising algorithmic tracks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Boycotts spotlight economics/design; lasting change needs defaults: user‑centric payouts, album‑first UX, and discovery not optimized for engagement.
  - Impact: More indies pivot to Bandcamp, vinyl, and self‑hosting; labels and DSPs face pressure to test user‑centric payout models.
  - Watch next: UMAW’s bill progress, any Spotify/Tidal user‑centric pilots, churn or revenue deltas for artists removing catalogs.
