# How I'm using Helix editor

- Score: 180 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45559076) | Link: https://rushter.com/blog/helix-editor/

- TL;DR
  - Author details a Helix setup for remote development that minimizes plugins to reduce supply‑chain risk: tmux popups for yazi/lazygit and piping terminal history into Helix, Vim-like keybindings, richer statusline, git shortcuts, autosave, inline diagnostics, and harper‑ls for comment grammar. HN discusses plugin minimalism versus IDE convenience, Emacs/Neovim’s growing built-ins, and Helix’s trade‑offs: fast, coherent defaults and solid LSP, but weaker ecosystem and less portability of Vim muscle memory across tools.

- Comment pulse
  - Minimalism to reduce supply-chain risk → Emacs 30/Eglot and modern Neovim built-ins lessen plugin sprawl; stability improves — counterpoint: PyCharm+IdeaVIM beats DIY time-cost.
  - Helix trade-offs → Fast defaults and solid LSP; but Vim muscle memory portability is lacking, and limited extensibility pushes file management/linting to tmux/external tools.
  - Onboarding aids → Keybinding sprawl is hard to remember; some use printed cheat sheets to internalize Helix without heavy configuration.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Helix + tmux + external TUIs is a pragmatic, low-trust editing stack for remote servers.
  - Impact: Fewer in-editor plugins shift complexity to well-scoped tools; Emacs/Neovim trends toward built-ins reinforce this direction.
  - Watch next: Helix features: auto-reload, editable file explorer, lint beyond LSP, plugin policy; measure startup time, memory, and remote latency.
