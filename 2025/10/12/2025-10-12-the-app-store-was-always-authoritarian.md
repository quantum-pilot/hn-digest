# The App Store was always authoritarian

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556032) | Link: https://infrequently.org/2025/10/the-app-store-was-always-authoritarian/

- TL;DR
  - Alex Russell argues Apple’s App Store is structurally authoritarian: it centralizes API power, censors at governments’ request (e.g., an ICE‑abuse archive), and suppresses web interoperability that could undercut its rent‑generating “services.” He says Apple resists the DMA’s browser‑engine choice to keep PWAs weak on iOS, aided by a credulous tech press; Google/Play aren’t better. HN debates profit vs principle and whether paternalistic gatekeeping protects users or simply entrenches state and corporate control over what software people can run.

- Comment pulse
  - Corporations chase profit, not principles → Expecting Cook to defy an elected strongman is naive — counterpoint: Apple defied the FBI in 2016; leadership/context matter.
  - Centralized app stores amplify censorship → Apple/Google routinely yank apps on government demand; users lack alternative distribution on mobile.
  - Gatekeeping trades safety for agency → paternalism shields many from malware, yet ≈1,700 yearly government takedowns erode trust in motives.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Platform gatekeeping throttles web apps and AI agents; DMA-enforced engine choice is the real competitive lever, not alternative stores.
  - Impact: Developers of PWAs, news/civic apps, and on-device AI face fewer routes to users and higher taxes, especially on iOS.
  - Watch next: EU DMA enforcement on iOS browser engines, Android install-API parity for web apps, and auditable takedown transparency across app stores.
