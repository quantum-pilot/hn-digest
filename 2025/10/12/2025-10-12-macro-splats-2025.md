# Macro Splats 2025

- Score: 373 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556952) | Link: https://danybittel.ch/macro.html

- TL;DR
    - Photographer Dany Bittel builds “Macro Splats”: photoreal 3D insect reconstructions via Gaussian splatting. He overcomes macro depth-of-field limits by focus stacking 16 images per angle, shooting 111 viewpoints (1,776 frames in ~4 hours), reconstructing poses in COLMAP, and training in Postshot to produce realtime models. He also releases a cluster fly model under CC BY. HN praises the visuals; some question game use (non‑PBR lighting, weak rigging/editability). Others note site UX quirks and point to bokeh/DOF‑aware splat research and collaboration ideas.

- Comment pulse
    - Use in games? → Real-time, stunning assets excite, but splats lack true PBR lighting, rigging, and editability—counterpoint: great for standalone visualization.
    - Site UX → Dark grey/black text criticized as unreadable; others report clear rendering, highlighting how display setups and vision vary.
    - Technique ideas → Fit splats with focus-distance dependence to model bokeh; commenters link active DOF-GS work. Plus kudos for open release and collaboration suggestions.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Macro focus stacking + splats yields museum-grade static assets capturing microgeometry and view-dependent iridescence without hand modeling.
    - Impact: Broader digitization for specimens, jewelry, and forensics; easier sharing via downloadable models and browser viewers.
    - Watch next: Re-lightable and deformable splats, bokeh-aware training, standardized capture rigs, and mobile performance benchmarks for large, high-frequency assets.
