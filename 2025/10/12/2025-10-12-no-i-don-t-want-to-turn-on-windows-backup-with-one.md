# No I don't want to turn on Windows Backup with One Drive

- Score: 485 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45559023) | Link: https://idiallo.com/byte-size/say-no-to-onedrive-backup

- TL;DR
  - The author criticizes Windows 11’s OneDrive backup nag: no clear “Never” option, ambiguous “No thanks,” and prompts that return after reboot—an illusion of choice. HN commenters report OneDrive silently remapping Documents/Pictures, re-enabling itself, uploading screenshots and game caches, breaking apps via path changes, and even deleting files on unlink. Many call it KPI-driven dark patterns harming nontechnical users. Workarounds include debloating tools or switching to Linux, though Adobe/Resolve/Office/AutoHotkey needs keep many on Windows.

- Comment pulse
  - OneDrive disrupts and risks data loss → folder remaps, surprise uploads (screenshots, game caches), re-enables itself; unlinking can remove local files.
  - Dark patterns boost KPIs, not user consent → “Maybe later” replaces “Never,” causing support pain for families and elderly — counterpoint: ChromeOS reportedly honors a true disable.
  - Remedies diverge → switch to Linux (Mint/Fedora/Bazzite/Bluefin) or debloat Windows; app lock-in (Adobe/Resolve/Office/AHK) keeps users on Windows.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Add a clear “Never” and a global “disable cloud integration” switch; persist and respect it across reinstalls.
  - Impact: Fewer support incidents and data-loss reports; improved trust; potential short-term hit to OneDrive adoption metrics.
  - Watch next: Windows Insider UX changes, EU/FTC dark-pattern enforcement, vendor benchmarks on data-loss/rollback safety.
