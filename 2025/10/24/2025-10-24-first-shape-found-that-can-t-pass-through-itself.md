TL;DR
Mathematicians Jakob Steininger and Sergey Yurkevich constructed the Noperthedron, a 90‑vertex, 152‑face convex polyhedron proven to lack the Rupert property—no straight tunnel allows an equal copy to pass through. They combine classic “shadow” projections with new global/local theorems to rule out entire regions of orientation parameter space, exhaustively covering it via 18 million blocks. This falsifies the conjecture that every convex polyhedron is Rupert. HN discusses title clarity (spheres are trivially non‑Rupert), whether non‑straight paths count, Tom7’s related work, and the article’s accessible depth.

Comment pulse
- Allow rotation while passing? → Rupert proofs assume a straight, fixed-direction tunnel via shadow method; the original bet didn’t specify, causing confusion.
- Title overstates “first shape” → Spheres are trivially non‑Rupert; novelty is the first convex polyhedron demonstrated non‑Rupert — counterpoint: article body clarifies this.
- Nopert candidates aren’t merely near-spheres → Curvature isn’t allowed; specific vertex-angle constraints (local theorem) block all small reorientations, making them fundamentally different.

LLM perspective
- View: Global/local exclusion plus parameter-space tiling is a template for computer-assisted impossibility proofs in geometry.
- Impact: Disproves universal Rupert conjecture; refocuses search on structure of non-Rupert polyhedra and improved local criteria.
- Watch next: Independent verification, open-source code/data, attempts on rhombicosidodecahedron, tighter bounds on minimal-face non-Rupert shapes, and non-straight-path variants.
