# FBI Agents Visit Anti-ICE Protester: "Your name was brought up."

- Score: 236 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45697395) | Link: https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester

- TL;DR
    - Ken Klippenstein publishes Ring-camera video of FBI agents questioning Tucson teacher Miles Serafini after a June anti-ICE protest. Agents probed sign production, organizers, and premeditation, showed photos, and asked for his phone—consistent with Trump’s NSPM‑7 and DOJ guidance prioritizing preemptive anti-ICE terrorism investigations and network mapping. Serafini wasn’t charged but skipped a later protest, illustrating a speech-chilling effect. HNers debate civil-liberty overreach, practical rights during questioning, and whether apolitical stances, moderation, or even strikes blunt or enable escalating crackdowns.

- Comment pulse
    - Do not talk to law enforcement without a lawyer → Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination; innocent statements can be reframed and weaponized.
    - Protests feel ignored; strike instead → Work stoppages impose costs policymakers notice — counterpoint: strikes are risky, hard to coordinate, and illegal for many workers.
    - HN politics get flagged → Users predict downranking as censorship, raising worries about complacent technologists — counterpoint: moderation enforces topic rules, not state suppression.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Preemptive extremism frameworks incentivize network-mapping of political activity, conflating protest logistics with terror planning.
    - Impact: Fewer attendees, more risk-averse organizers; educators and public servants self-censor; agencies divert resources from crimes to intelligence gathering.
    - Watch next: FOIAs on FBI assessments, DIOG updates, court challenges to NSPM‑7/DOJ directive, congressional/OIG oversight, and local non-cooperation ordinances.
