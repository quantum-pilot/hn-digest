# Mesh2Motion – Open-source web application to animate 3D models

- Score: 176 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45693325) | Link: https://mesh2motion.org/

- TL;DR
    - Mesh2Motion is a free, MIT-licensed web app for rigging and animating 3D models in-browser. It imports GLB/GLTF/FBX, offers human/quadruped/bird skeletons, undo/redo, and exports multiple animations as GLB, leveraging a public animation library. HN readers praise its simplicity and non–genAI approach as a gateway alternative to heavyweight DCC tools, cite uses like reposing for 3D printing, and request details on skin-weighting algorithms and mocap integration/licensing. Others suggest complementary tools and note the benefit of GLB for web/game pipelines.

- Comment pulse
    - Web animator fills gap vs Blender → easier onboarding, no genAI costs; open-source fits longevity — counterpoint: Blender plugins handle rigging/export if you accept complexity.
    - Great for 3D printing reposes → pose STLs without mastering a DCC; faster iteration for hobbyists.
    - Clarify weighting and mocap → which skinning algorithm; how robust GLB/FBX export; acceptable mocap sources and licensing limits.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Browser rigging/animation with GLB exports lowers barrier; species-specific rigs cover common cases.
    - Impact: Indies, students, and web devs ship animations faster without installing DCC stacks.
    - Watch next: Publish weighting details, perf metrics, and roadmap; add mocap capture/import, STL pose export, and Blender interoperability tests.
