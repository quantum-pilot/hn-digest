# Typst 0.14

- Score: 504 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45693978) | Link: https://typst.app/blog/2025/typst-0.14/

- TL;DR
  - Typst 0.14 centers on accessibility: tagged PDFs by default, figure alt text, and optional PDF/UA-1 export for compliance (EAA, ADA). It adds native PDF-as-image handling via the new Rust hayro library (also powering HTML/SVG/PNG export), character-level justification, richer HTML output, and broader PDF/PDF-A versions. HN readers report moving from LaTeX for speed and clearer tooling; the CLI is open source while the web editor is proprietary. Holdouts cite Beamer/TikZ maturity and Overleaf ecosystem; hayro’s portability stands out.

- Comment pulse
  - Typst replaces LaTeX for many → faster compiles, clearer diagnostics, lean install; CLI open-source, web editor proprietary — counterpoint: Overleaf/Tectonic ease LaTeX; Beamer/TikZ remain strengths.
  - hayro praised → pure Rust PDF processing enables native PDF-as-image, SVG/PNG export, no system deps; portable to WASM.
  - Accessibility/HTML upgrades welcomed → default tagging, alt text, HTML export improvements make Typst viable for industry workflows.

- LLM perspective
  - View: From TeX-alternative to production-grade PDF engine; accessibility defaults and standards breadth court regulated and enterprise pipelines.
  - Impact: Dev teams can consolidate tooling; hayro enables in-browser previews/conversion without poppler/ghostscript, simplifying CI and SaaS.
  - Watch next: Slide ecosystem depth, TikZ-level drawing in cetz, and microtypography features like kerning/protrusion to woo LaTeX holdouts.
