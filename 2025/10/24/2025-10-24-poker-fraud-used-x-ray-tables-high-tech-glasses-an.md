# Poker fraud used X-ray tables, high-tech glasses and NBA players

- TL;DR
    - US prosecutors allege a mafia-run underground poker ring used X‑ray card tables, marked decks, hidden cameras, and rigged shufflers to fleece high-rollers. Celebrities, including NBA coach Chauncey Billups and ex‑player Damon Jones, allegedly lured victims; off‑site “operators” fed signals to an at‑table “quarterback,” yielding at least $7m since 2019, laundered via crypto and shells. HN debates whether such tech was necessary or even plausible, suggests blackmail and sports‑betting may be the real monetization, and questions the relatively small haul.

- Comment pulse
    - Overkill: once whales sit, skill edge suffices → cheating kills the golden goose — counterpoint: knowing hole cards crushes variance and helps keep victims engaged.
    - Shufflers can read/sort decks; hidden cams plausible → X-ray tables face skepticism due to physics and bulk; marked cards + optics likely.
    - $7m seems small split many ways → value is untraceable cash and leverage; larger play could be blackmail and rigged sports bets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This blends classic advantage-play tech with social engineering via celebrity bait; full-stack control minimized randomness.
    - Impact: Casinos/private games will harden: ban external shufflers, audit tables, neutral dealers, RF sweeps, and mandatory deck custody chains.
    - Watch next: Evidence quality: demonstrate “X‑ray” claims, indictments unsealed, plea deals, links to NBA injury-betting case, and AML actions against crypto off-ramps.
