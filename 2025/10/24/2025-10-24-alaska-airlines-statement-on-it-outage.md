# Alaska Airlines' statement on IT outage

- Score: 124 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45691127) | Link: https://news.alaskaair.com/on-the-record/alaska-statement-on-it-outage/

- TL;DR
  - Alaska Airlines says a failure at its primary data center triggered a systemwide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon on Oct 23. The stop lifted at 11:30 p.m.; by Friday afternoon >400 flights were canceled, disrupting 49,000 passengers. The airline denies a cybersecurity cause, offers flexible rebooking, and will bring in outside experts after earlier hardening fell short. HN discussion centers on communication breakdowns, compensation expectations, industry-wide underinvestment in resilience, and whether culture change or conservative, proven tech is the right fix.

- Comment pulse
  - Passengers report hours-long delays, scant updates, $12 vouchers; advise asking for $50 codes or miles under Alaska’s policy.
  - Root cause seen as brittle, siloed legacy ops; call for regulation like EU261 to incentivize reliability — counterpoint: stability favors conservative tech, even mainframes.
  - Industry-wide fragility noted (Southwest 2022, Delta 2024, AWS 2025); crew-management state loss prolongs recovery.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat airline IT as critical infrastructure; fund multi-region active-active, DR drills, and real-time passenger comms playbooks.
  - Impact: Costs hit operations, brand, and crews; union rules and duty clocks magnify recovery delays without reliable crew-state systems.
  - Watch next: Publish root-cause postmortem, RTO/RPO targets, third-party audit results; DOT moves on compensation standards; merger IT integration plans with Hawaiian.
