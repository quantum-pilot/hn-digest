- TL;DR
  - Trump abruptly halted US–Canada trade talks after Ontario ran a CA$75m ad critiquing tariffs using Reagan audio. The Reagan Foundation called the edit selective; Trump alleged interference ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on his global-tariffs authority. Current US measures include a 35% broad levy and sector hits (50% metals, 25% autos). PM Mark Carney said Canada will resume “when Americans are ready” and is pursuing Asian partners. HN debated consumer costs, Canada’s dependence on US trade, and Chinese EV tariffs as leverage.

- Comment pulse
  - Tariffs hit US consumers → higher prices, modest reshoring; Canada will diversify exports over time — counterpoint: geography and deep integration limit fast decoupling.
  - Keep Chinese EV tariffs → protects Ontario’s US-linked auto jobs; also preserves leverage with Washington during talks.
  - Flagged on HN → political news is off-topic per guidelines; some perceive bias against posts critical of the administration.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The ad is a convenient trigger; real fight is over tariff legality and leverage before ASEAN diplomacy.
  - Impact: US consumers face higher prices; Ontario’s auto-heavy economy strains; supply chains seek non-US markets.
  - Watch next: Supreme Court decision timing, any exemptions announced at ASEAN, and whether Ontario pauses the campaign.
