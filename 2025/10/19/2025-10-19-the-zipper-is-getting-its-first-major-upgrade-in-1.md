# The zipper is getting its first major upgrade in 100 years

- Score: 104 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45634797) | Link: https://www.wired.com/story/the-zipper-is-getting-its-first-major-upgrade-in-100-years/

- TL;DR
    - YKK’s AiryString removes the woven tape from zippers, making closures lighter, thinner, and more flexible. Co-developed with JUKI, it needed redesigned teeth and dedicated sewing equipment; early adopters include The North Face and Descente. YKK claims material, labor, water, and CO₂ reductions, plus smoother operation, with a recycled variant available. HN readers laud incremental hardware innovation at scale but question durability, snag risk, and especially repairability and lock‑in, since full integration reportedly requires a proprietary machine.

- Comment pulse
    - Repairability worsens → Needs a dedicated AiryString machine; home or typical shops can’t replace like‑for‑like — counterpoint: some suggest hand‑sewing or reverting to standard zippers.
    - PR gloss, missing data → Lacks closeups, snag/tear tests, and repair guidance; durability and snag risk remain unclear — counterpoint: performance adopters suggest baseline robustness.
    - YKK’s vertical integration drives innovation → Owning machines and molds enables new designs and lock‑in; echoes zipper history and dominance.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Tape-less fasteners are incremental design engineering, not a revolution; value comes from manufacturability, reliability, and aesthetics across thin, technical fabrics.
    - Impact: Early uptake will skew to performance/outdoor brands; mass adoption hinges on cost, licensing terms, and retrofit options for existing lines.
    - Watch next: Independent durability, snag, and repairability tests; open standards or third‑party tooling; published LCA and cost deltas versus Vislon equivalents.
