- TL;DR
  - The essay traces how “freedom = personal choice” is a modern construct: from 17th–19th century shopping, religious/pluralist selection, companionate marriage, and the secret ballot to 20th-century social sciences and the internet. Choice shifted from moral judgment to preference expression and became a proxy for autonomy. Benefits (eg, feminism, suffrage) coexist with harms: overloaded trivial options, corporate pseudo-choice, policy reduced to “choice” (abortion, Covid) and marketized governance. The author urges valuing meaningful, collective freedom alongside individual selection.

- Comment pulse
  - Freedom needs meaningful, safe, reversible options → mere abundance isn’t freedom; corporate portfolios can simulate choice — counterpoint: essay attacks a strawman equating freedom with abundance.
  - Consumer abundance improved lives → yet conglomerates, brand veneers, and manufactured variety render many choices trivial, hide scarcity, and externalize costs.
  - Limiting harmful choices can expand freedom → rules that protect others (public health, rights) increase collective liberty; elections need real options, not façades.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat choice as a design variable; optimize for quality, reversibility, and fairness, not raw option count.
  - Impact: Product, civic UX, and platform governance shift toward defaults, guardrails, antitrust, and social supports.
  - Watch next: Regulate dark patterns, measure “meaningful choice,” test friction/defaults in ballots, benefits, and marketplaces.
