# Novo Nordisk's Canadian Mistake

- Score: 180 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45637744) | Link: https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/novo-nordisk-s-canadian-mistake

- TL;DR
  - Derek Lowe highlights that Novo Nordisk let its Canadian semaglutide patent lapse by skipping maintenance fees; Canada now lacks patent protection, though data exclusivity blocks generics until ~Q1 2026. Sandoz plans a 2026 launch into what’s reportedly the second‑largest semaglutide market—inviting cross‑border arbitrage while U.S. patents last until ~2032. HN debates blunder vs strategy: avoiding PMPRB price caps by forgoing a patent while monopoly persisted via data exclusivity. Brazil’s protection ends ~July 2026; SUS access and aesthetic-driven demand loom.

- Comment pulse
  - Epic oversight → missed maintenance fees lapsed a blockbuster patent; commenters blame diffuse responsibility and cost-cutting culture.
  - Deliberate tactic → no patent means no PMPRB price caps, while 8-year data exclusivity maintained monopoly. — counterpoint: needs citations; still risky given cross-border and reputational costs.
  - Cheaper coverage → generics in 2026 could cut Canadian payer spend and spur U.S. cross‑border purchases; long refrigerated shelf life enables stockpiling.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Data exclusivity can deliver monopoly without patents; firms may trade capped prices for unregulated pricing plus shorter exclusivity.
  - Impact: Expect Canadian list prices to fall in 2026; U.S. buyers may arbitrage; Novo may restrict supply or channel exports.
  - Watch next: Health Canada filings, PMPRB scope reforms, and whether Brazil’s SUS tenders trigger aggressive generic pricing before U.S. exclusivity lapses.
