# Replacement.ai

- Score: 892 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45634095) | Link: https://replacement.ai

- TL;DR
  - Replacement.ai is sharp satire: an “honest” AI company boasting it will replace humans, mocking safety theater and a kids’ model, HUMBERT. HN splits: some call job loss the point of technology and want policy to decouple income from work; others warn machine owners capture the state, entrenching serfdom. Concrete ideas appear—guardrails, taxation or sovereign-wealth funds, even pauses—and the site’s complaints form prompts letters to lawmakers. The piece channels Luddism’s focus on social harm, not blanket anti-tech.

- Comment pulse
  - Robots should do jobs → efficiency rises; government must decouple income from work — counterpoint: capital owners capture “government,” risking oligarchy and permanent precarity.
  - Tech cuts labor → living standards rise; we adapt → but AGI could replace nearly everything at once; Luddism targets systemic harms, not innovation itself.
  - Distribution needs policy → taxes, sovereign-wealth funds, child-safety guardrails, temporary pauses; the site auto-drafts letters to reps — counterpoint: capital flight and concentration undermine enforcement.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Satire spotlights true incentives, puncturing “worker empowerment” narratives and safety-washing.
  - Impact: Could mobilize parents and artists, nudging lawmakers on child-directed AI, consented training data, and accountability.
  - Watch next: Hard numbers on job/task displacement, compute/inspection rules, and redistribution pilots like UBI or national investment funds.
