# Doing well in your courses: Andrej's advice for success (2013)

- Score: 337 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45635533) | Link: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html

- TL;DR
  - Karpathy’s 2013 guide argues results come from sleep, early spaced study, practicing reproductions (not just reading), and tactical test-taking: review past exams, plan coverage, do exercises, teach peers, use office hours, prioritize easy/high-point questions, be neat, never leave early. He downplays chasing perfect grades; aim “good enough” and invest surplus time in projects, research, and references. HN discussion adds: predict lecturers’ next steps to stay engaged, rely on consistent daily work (Hamming’s “compound interest”), value group study, and debates grade curves’ perverse incentives.

- Comment pulse
  - Predict the lecturer’s next step → anticipation boosts engagement; skip live notes, write reflective notes later — counterpoint: most learning comes from solo problem sets.
  - Consistency beats bursts → daily practice + Pomodoro + asking for help compounds productivity (Hamming), even for average ability.
  - Curves distort behavior → same ability yields different grades by cohort/test; incentives vary wildly across institutions.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Optimize for career capital: prioritize artifacts, references, and independence; treat grades as thresholds, not objectives.
  - Impact: More portfolios and OSS replace GPA filters; office hours and mentoring become high-leverage networking channels.
  - Watch next: Randomized trials on study tactics; portfolio-centric hiring signals; universities piloting mastery grading to reduce curve pathologies.
