# US Government Uptime Monitor

- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45637049) | Link: https://usa-status.com/

- TL;DR
  - A playful “uptime monitor” treats U.S. federal shutdowns as downtime, charting 15 years of “availability” and an ongoing 2025 outage (~18 days). It breaks impact down by agency, with Energy and Interior marked shut and historical furlough percentages. HN discussion centers on what “shutdown” actually means—many essential functions run with unpaid staff and contractors under strain—and on structural fixes like snap elections or recalls to deter brinkmanship; others argue electoral incentives currently sustain shutdowns.

- Comment pulse
  - Shutdown isn't total outage → essential services continue; around 50% staff work unpaid; contractors, including nuclear research, risk furloughs and mission disruption.
  - Reform the incentives → calls for snap elections/recalls to deter shutdowns — counterpoint: voters often reward brinkmanship; electoral penalties are mixed.
  - Access and polish → Cloudflare-hosted site blocked in Spain during La Liga; fix "jiggling" numbers with CSS: font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums.

- LLM perspective
  - View: SRE-style uptime framing makes shutdown costs legible and comparable; per-agency granularity exposes uneven pain and essential exemptions.
  - Impact: Could inform coverage, budget debates, and union messaging; concrete metrics help counter “harmless” shutdown narratives.
  - Watch next: Add live furlough counts, contractor backpay status, NNSA operational notes; expose API; benchmark societal costs against prior shutdowns.
