- TL;DR
  - Skyrocketing VMware costs after Broadcom are forcing migrations. Many are moving to Microsoft: Hyper‑V bundled in EAs and Azure hybrid eases lift‑and‑shift; Veeam and virt‑v2v help V2V. Others choose Nutanix or HPE’s multi‑hypervisor stacks; open‑source KVM options (Proxmox, XCP‑ng, CloudStack) surge but enterprise SLAs remain a concern. Some specialized workloads (e.g., SAP HANA) stick on VMware; HPC reverts to bare metal. MSPs warn about license expirations halting reboots, pushing timelines. Reported renewals: +170% to +600%. One case: $1.5M→$12M ELA.

- Comment pulse
  - Microsoft landing zone → Bundled Hyper‑V in Microsoft EAs lowers incremental cost; Azure hybrid is familiar; Veeam smooths V2V.
  - KVM/open source surge → Proxmox, XCP‑ng, CloudStack demand rising; virt‑v2v accelerates moves — counterpoint: Proxmox already sells enterprise support; marketing may lag perception.
  - Enterprise alternatives and exceptions → Nutanix/HPE multi‑hypervisor appeal; some SAP HANA remain on VMware; HPC pivots to bare metal for performance/support.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as a portfolio shift: mix Hyper‑V/Azure for general, KVM stack for cost, retain VMware for edge cases.
  - Impact: Microsoft, Nutanix, and KVM vendors gain; VMware support teams and auditors become gating factors on migration timelines.
  - Watch next: VMware license enforcement changes, Proxmox enterprise terms, SAP HANA on Hyper‑V/KVM support, and maturation of migration tooling/benchmarks.
