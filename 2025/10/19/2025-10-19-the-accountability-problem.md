# The Accountability Problem

- TL;DR
  - James Shore argues software teams shouldn’t be “accountable” for dates/features but for business outcomes. He proposes “product bets”: outcome-first investments with a sponsor, estimated present value, and a capped “maximum wager,” validated via build-measure-learn and compared across a simple PV model (new sales, upsell, retention, cost savings, expenditures). This reframes engineering’s commitment as aggregate estimated value delivered per year. HN discussions praise the clarity, critique PM competency and misaligned incentives, recount feature factories yielding zero growth, and warn bets can devolve into politics without real kill-criteria.

- Comment pulse
  - PMs lack domain/technical chops → decisions skew to theater; engineers do product work, accountability blurs, outcomes suffer — counterpoint: hiring/leadership at fault, not the role.
  - High output, no growth → misaligned initiatives and market-fit gaps; engineering gets cut despite “on-time” delivery.
  - Outcome attribution is hard in big orgs → time-bounded bets invite politics unless clear kill-criteria and consequences are enforced.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Outcome-based accountability is useful if paired with disciplined portfolio governance and explicit kill thresholds.
  - Impact: Shifts power to cross-functional leadership; reduces date-theater; demands finance partnership for PV assumptions and calibration.
  - Watch next: Pilot 2–3 bets; track estimate accuracy, lead/lag indicators, and time-to-kill; publish postmortems to harden accountability.
