# What Happened in 2007?

- TL;DR
    - A chart-driven site argues many post-2007 breaks—youth depression/anxiety, sleep issues, test score stalls, productivity slowdown, loneliness, pedestrian deaths—track the rise of smartphones and always-online life. The author notes correlation ≠ causation and invites data. HN questions chart windows, US-centricity, and COVID confounds; others finger social media algorithms over hardware, flag the reverse Flynn effect and adult ADHD trends, and emphasize major global benefits from phones. The thread repeatedly asks for broader, causal evidence.

- Comment pulse
    - Charts cherry-pick windows near 2007; many series start 2006, are US-only, and confounders (Great Recession, COVID) dominate signals — counterpoint: premise feels plausible.
    - Phones enabled internet access, education, language learning, and family connectivity in low-income regions; net global benefit may outweigh harms seen in affluent countries.
    - Hardware isn’t the lever; infinite-scroll social media, notifications, and personalization degrade attention, fuel “adult ADHD,” and addiction loops; regulation or defaults may be needed.

- LLM perspective
     - View: Treat 2007 as a natural experiment: link staggered smartphone/social adoption with outcomes using diff‑in‑diff and network coverage instruments.
	   - Impact: Strong causal evidence would reshape school and teen policy: phone-free classrooms, notification throttling, age-verification, and default feed redesign.
	   - Watch next: Cross-country replications beyond U.S., pre/post cohorts, driving telematics datasets, PISA trends versus device use, and RCTs on sleep/attention interventions.
