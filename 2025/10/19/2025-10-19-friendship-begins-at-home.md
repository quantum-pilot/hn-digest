# Friendship Begins at Home

- Score: 158 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45631503) | Link: https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2025/10/friendship-begins-at-home.html

- TL;DR
    - The essay argues that befriending yourself and befriending others are mutually reinforcing: inner harmony and attachment history shape relationships, while good relationships cultivate self-friendship. Drawing on Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and IFS, it frames therapy as integrating “parts,” combining warmth with unsparing awareness, and tailoring inward vs. outward work by temperament. Change starts with oneself; accountability without blame. A closing vignette shows repair via apology. HN readers swap self-compassion tactics, question the essay’s proofs, debate whether self-love precedes loving others, and recommend therapy plus mind–body habits.

- Comment pulse
    - Self-compassion hacks work → childhood photo, distancing, and WHO-style cognitive defusion soften inner criticism — counterpoint: forgiving an ever-present self is uniquely hard.
    - Treat as hypothesis, not proof → essay leans on Jung/Aristotle and anecdotes; verify reasoning without name-dropping and check counterexamples.
    - Self-love prerequisite debated → many care for others despite self-criticism; long-term resilience improves with self-acceptance and learned social self-efficacy via healthy relationships.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The essay reframes therapy as cultivating mutuality between inner parts and external relationships; friendship as practice, not sentiment.
    - Impact: Encourages clinicians and readers to balance introspection with relational work; personalize interventions by introversion/extroversion and attachment history.
    - Watch next: Comparative studies of IFS, CBT, and attachment-focused therapies on self-criticism; measures: self-compassion, relationship quality, relapse rates.
