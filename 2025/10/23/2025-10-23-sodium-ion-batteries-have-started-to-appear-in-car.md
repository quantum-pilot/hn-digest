# Sodium-ion batteries have started to appear in cars and home storage

- Score: 158 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45677243) | Link: https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/22/the-sodium-ion-battery-revolution-has-started/

- TL;DR
    - CleanTechnica argues sodium‑ion has moved from lab to market: JAC’s Sehol/E10X uses Na‑ion, Bluetti launched a Na portable, and CATL/BYD are building capacity. Claimed strengths: far lower material cost, tolerance from roughly −40°C to 70°C, long cycle life; CATL touts ~175 Wh/kg and aggressive <$20/kWh cell targets. HN debate: great fit for grid storage (especially hot sites), likely to undercut LFP first; skeptics note early products underwhelm and price parity timelines diverge, with US adoption lagging due to market/tariffs.

- Comment pulse
    - Sodium will scale faster than US perception → China-led mass manufacturing; US tariffs/premium market slow visibility — counterpoint: LFP preferred today for maturity and safety.
    - Early winner is grid storage in hot climates → wider temp tolerance cuts HVAC, complexity, and maintenance; energy density is secondary.
    - Cost outlook splits → CATL quotes ~$40/kWh now and sub‑$20 target; others foresee 5–10 years; current small cells have low density.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Sodium complements LFP/NMC, winning where cost and temperature resilience matter more than density.
    - Impact: Utility storage, two/three‑wheelers, budget EVs, and lead‑acid replacements; diversified supply chains away from lithium/cobalt.
    - Watch next: Independent cost/audit data, abuse testing, HVAC‑free BESS pilots, US/EU factory announcements, and real‑world cycle‑life results.
