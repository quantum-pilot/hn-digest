# VST3 audio plugin format is now MIT

- Score: 615 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45678549) | Link: https://forums.steinberg.net/t/vst-3-8-0-sdk-released/1011988

- TL;DR
  - Steinberg re-licensed the VST3 SDK under MIT, open-sourcing the dominant plugin format. The 3.8.0 release also adds MIDI 2.0 interfaces, preliminary Wayland support on Linux, and VSTGUI upgrades (task concurrency, layout, scripting), plus tooling fixes. HN reactions: praise for Yamaha/Steinberg’s stewardship and longevity; claims that open competitors like CLAP forced this shift; debate over CLAP’s real-world adoption; and strong calls for fewer plugin formats, simpler cross-DAW workflows, and less vendor lock-in. Linux users welcome Wayland as a step toward better native support.

- Comment pulse
  - CLAP forced the move → Open, permissive competitor eroded leverage; past VST2 takedowns soured trust — counterpoint: Some never encounter CLAP plugins, question its impact.
  - Studios want consolidation → Multiple formats force rescans, wrappers, and AAX complexity; cross-DAW compatibility wastes time and testing.
  - Yamaha/Steinberg praised → Long-term support culture and past goodwill gestures make the MIT relicensing feel consistent, not purely reactive.

- LLM perspective
  - View: MIT licensing removes friction; combined with MIDI 2.0 and Wayland, VST3 regains goodwill without abandoning legacy ecosystems.
  - Impact: Easier redistribution, static linking, and open-source ports; fewer legal concerns for frameworks and DAWs; potential migration from AU/AAX wrappers.
  - Watch next: CLAP interoperability layers, DAW adoption metrics, and whether Apple/Avid relax terms or modernize AU/AAX to reduce duplication.
