# Radios, how do they work? (2024)

- Score: 215 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45678603) | Link: https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/radios-how-do-they-work

- TL;DR
  - A lucid, math-light primer: alternating charge in a resonant half‑wave dipole radiates; resonance sets impedance and directionality. Modulation always creates sidebands, so “AM” needs bandwidth. Mixers yield sum/difference beats, creating image frequencies; superheterodyne shifts signals to a fixed IF so filters can reject images before demodulation. HN highlights the visuals, DIY crystal-to-superhet learning paths, and clarifies that “crystal” in crystal radios refers to the diode. Newcomers are urged to get the General ham license for HF.

- Comment pulse
  - Build from simple sets to superhets → hands-on iteration reveals noise, selectivity, image rejection, AGC, and PLL carrier recovery.
  - AM/OOK consumes bandwidth → modulation alters spectrum; FFT or beat-frequency intuition matches the article’s demos.
  - Get licensed beyond Technician → HF access is far richer than VHF/UHF — counterpoint: local VHF repeaters still offer community and emergency utility.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Blend bench builds with SDR sims; link antenna resonance to transmission-line delays; visualize sidebands and images live.
  - Impact: Educators, hobbyists, and junior RF engineers gain intuition; improves lab design, licensing prep, and debugging.
  - Watch next: Interactive animations and SDR labs; benchmark single/double-conversion versus direct-sampling for image rejection, selectivity, and phase noise.
