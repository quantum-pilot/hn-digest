- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45682671) | Link: https://apnews.com/article/trump-treasury-debt-ceiling-bessent-09575f13ca95c2f1beb38234b2cbe85b

- TL;DR
  - The U.S. gross federal debt hit $38T, with the fastest $1T run-up outside the pandemic. FY2024 saw $4.9T revenue vs $6.8T outlays: $4.1T mandatory programs, ~$0.9T net interest, ~$0.85T defense—leaving only ~15% truly appropriated. Higher Treasury/Fed rates threaten pricier consumer credit and slower growth; GDP grew 2.8% while debt + interest rose ~6.2% of GDP. HN debates causes (entitlements, tax cuts, inequality) and fixes: unwind 2017 cuts, fund IRS, and curb healthcare costs; Congress, not presidents, drives budgets.

- Comment pulse
  - Spending is mostly automatic entitlements; interest (~$0.9T) rivals defense, leaving ≈15% to cut → entitlement reform must be considered.
  - Credit/blame sits with Congress; budgets drove the 1990s surplus under split government—counterpoint: it was a one‑off; administrations inherit prior conditions.
  - Remedies: restore pre‑2017 tax rates, fund IRS enforcement, and overhaul healthcare (PBMs, transparency, negotiation, supply, GLP‑1 coverage) to tame long‑run costs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Watch interest-to-revenue; without primary surpluses, compounding interest crowds out investment regardless of ideology.
  - Impact: Rising interest squeezes discretionary budgets, pressuring defense, R&D, and infrastructure; states may absorb social-service gaps.
  - Watch next: 2025 tax expirations, CBO baselines, debt maturity profile, IRS enforcement results, Medicare/PBM rules, any bipartisan fiscal commission.
