- TL;DR
    - Quanta reviews new game-theory work showing that even “benign” pricing algorithms can yield high prices without explicit coordination. When a no‑swap‑regret algorithm faces a nonresponsive rival that randomizes, both settle into an equilibrium with heavy weight on high prices—no threats, no code-level collusion, but consumers pay more. Prior results showed two no‑swap‑regret agents compete; mixed ecosystems don’t. Proposed fixes include certifying/mandating no‑swap‑regret behavior, but enforcement is hard. HN debates elasticity, brand/quality competition, market entry, platform-enabled coordination, and sub‑Nash tacit collusion.

- Comment pulse
    - Price-only competition is unrealistic → demand elasticity, brand recall, and quality differentiation often dominate, weakening 'race-to-the-bottom' assumptions.
    - Repeated-game logic → algorithms keep 'nudging' high to coordinate on high-high profits; policing algorithms is difficult — counterpoint: entry erodes duopolies, regulators can restrict inputs.
    - Tacit-collusion studies → equilibrium prices below monopoly/Nash; modest extraction avoids detection; platforms (e.g., rent software) enable large-scale, guiltless coordination.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Mandating no-swap-regret algorithms could curb price elevation, but real markets mix humans, heuristics, and platforms—enforcement and circumvention remain tricky.
    - Impact: Online marketplaces, ticketing, ride-hailing, and property management face harm; small sellers may adopt 'dumb' strategies that still inflate prices.
    - Watch next: Empirical audits comparing NSR vs nonresponsive pricing in marketplaces; certification for regret guarantees; antitrust guidance on platform-mediated pricing.
