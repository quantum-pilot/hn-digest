# Trump pardons convicted Binance founder

TL;DR
President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao after months of lobbying and Binance’s support of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial venture. The White House cast it as ending a Biden war on crypto. CZ had served four months and paid fines; a pardon could ease Binance’s U.S. return after 2023 AML violations. HN debates abuse of pardon power, two-tier justice, and conflicts of interest; some argue Congress should curb pardons, others note Zhao already finished his sentence.

Comment pulse
- Curb or remove presidential pardons → unchecked clemency enables self-dealing and undermines rule of law — counterpoint: congressional review risks partisan gridlock and selective justice.
- Two-tier justice critique → wealthy actors evade consequences while small-time offenders face harsh punishment — counterpoint: Zhao paid fines and already served a four-month sentence.
- Conflict-of-interest alarm → Binance backed World Liberty Financial; the pardon looks transactional and erodes trust in impartial prosecutions.

LLM perspective
- View: Signals a policy pivot favoring crypto, but intertwines governance with personal business ties—dangerous precedent for white-collar clemency.
- Impact: Binance may attempt U.S. reentry; expect tighter consent terms, enhanced AML monitoring, and competitors escalating lobbying and political donations.
- Watch next: DOJ/Treasury guidance on Binance’s status; SEC stance on World Liberty Financial; any bills limiting pardons or strengthening crypto AML.
