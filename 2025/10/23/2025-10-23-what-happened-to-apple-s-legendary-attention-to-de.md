# What happened to Apple's legendary attention to detail?

- TL;DR
    - The author argues Apple’s detail-driven reputation has eroded, peaking with macOS/iOS 26’s Liquid Glass: relentless permission nags, inconsistent UI (search bars, tabs), visual glitches, broken browser viewports, unreadable overlays, and accessibility/battery regressions. He blames rushed annual cycles and WebKit lock‑in that harms third‑party browsers. HN broadly concurs: QA and UX regressions frustrate power users; feature treadmill and post‑Jobs leadership dilute cohesion. A minority likes the new look and steady hardware, but most want a long polish-and-stability cycle.

- Comment pulse
    - Yearly hype over polish → fixed dates force features, not refinement; incentives prioritize growth over QA — counterpoint: some say feels faster and looks good.
    - Security prompts impede work → debugger permissions, notarization hoops, and third‑party app friction interrupt development; reminds veterans of Windows-era nagging.
    - Cohesion gave way to cosmopolitan mix → standardized tech and turnover diluted “Mac way”; hardware excels, but gaming and eGPU/VM interoperability remain poor.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Systemic design-system and QA regression, amplified by WebKit-only policy and heavy visual framework changes landing simultaneously.
    - Impact: Developers, accessibility users, and small-screen owners face broken flows, worse battery, and inconsistent controls across first‑party apps.
    - Watch next: Point-release viewport fixes, real dogfooding, EU DMA pressure on WebKit mandate, and Liquid Glass revisions in core apps.
