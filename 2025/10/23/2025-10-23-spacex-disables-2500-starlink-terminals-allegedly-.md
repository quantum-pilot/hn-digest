# SpaceX disables 2,500 Starlink terminals allegedly used by Asian scam centers

- Score: 224 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45680547) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/starlink-blocks-2500-dishes-allegedly-used-by-myanmars-notorious-scam-centers/

- TL;DR
  - SpaceX says it disabled over 2,500 Starlink terminals around suspected scam compounds in Myanmar, following junta raids that seized dozens at KK Park and detained ~2,200. Starlink isn’t licensed in Myanmar; SpaceX cites policy violations and tools like terminal-ID blocks/geofencing. UN and reporters had flagged criminals bypassing controls; Sen. Maggie Hassan pressed Musk to act. HN splits between viewing this as overdue action against human‑trafficking “scam cities” and concerns about Starlink’s role in conflicts and U.S. leverage over connectivity.

- Comment pulse
  - Abuse is clear → scam centers use trafficking and torture; militias profit; cutting links disrupts crimes — counterpoint: may aid one faction in civil war.
  - Action was late → UNODC and reporters flagged Starlink-aided scams in 2024; SpaceX moved after U.S. Senate pressure, then disabled ~2,500 beyond ~30–80 seized.
  - Scale limits U.S. control → Starlink serves few users; terrestrial ISPs dominate; satellite IP/geofencing can block regions but won’t govern global internet access.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Harder onboarding and reseller audits plus geofenced-by-default regions reduce gray-market terminal leakage.
  - Impact: Scam compounds lose bandwidth; traffickers pivot to 4G/microwave; some humanitarian users near borders risk collateral cutoffs.
  - Watch next: Starlink transparency metrics, SEA licensing decisions, anti-tamper hardware, reseller takedowns, and law-enforcement MoUs to verify sustained disruption.
