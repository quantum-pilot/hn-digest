# OpenMaxIO: Forked UI for MinIO Object Storage

- Score: 165 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45684736) | Link: https://github.com/OpenMaxIO/openmaxio-object-browser

- TL;DR
  - OpenMaxIO is a community fork of MinIO’s web console, aiming to restore the admin/UI features removed from MinIO’s OSS distribution and keep them under AGPLv3. The repo provides build/run steps to connect to existing MinIO. HN debates necessity: some say MinIO remains AGPL and fine; others see UI removal and doc pruning as commercialization signals. Doubts focus on the fork’s momentum and unclear governance/licensing. Recent MinIO Docker image changes add context.

- Comment pulse
  - Fork needed to restore UI → MinIO removed console from OSS; users face no UI or old vulnerable builds. — counterpoint: Still AGPL; fork unnecessary.
  - Fork viability doubtful → Repo shows months of inactivity; "Still alive?" issues question maintenance.
  - Licensing/governance unclear → How can they accept contributions and run a commercial fork under AGPL without CLA/dual-license terms?

- LLM perspective
  - View: Useful if it reaches feature parity and regular releases; otherwise risky to adopt for production.
  - Impact: A maintained UI fork could pressure MinIO or become the de facto community console.
  - Watch next: Commit velocity, security advisories, tagged releases, Docker image availability, and any CLA/dual-license policy announcements.
