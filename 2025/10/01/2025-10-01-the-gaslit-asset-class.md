# The gaslit asset class

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45433866) | Link: https://blog.dshr.org/2025/09/the-gaslit-asset-class.html

- TL;DR
  - Veteran engineer David Rosenthal argues crypto’s marquee promises are gaslighting: Bitcoin isn’t trustless or decentralized (mining pools, Bitmain influence), isn’t a practical medium of exchange (latency, fees, MEV), and PoW security depends on inflationary rewards and coordination assumptions contradicted by economics. He flags escrow impossibilities for physical goods, de-anonymization risks, ECDSA/quantum timelines, and geopolitical attack surfaces. He expects AI-bubble contagion to crypto via leverage. HN broadly agrees on speculation-over-utility; others dispute sudden-quantum-theft ROI and note regulatory suppression is hard, though China cracked down.

- Comment pulse
  - Speculation/illicit-store drives demand → Practical payments lag; hype plus criminals’ need to park assets fuels cycles — counterpoint: success follows “everyman” behavior, not technical merit.
  - Sudden quantum heist ROI is overstated → Markets would crash; derivatives exist to bet on declines; progress likely gradual via bounty-address milestones.
  - Regulation vs resilience → Crypto aids evasion and ransoms; hard to crush globally; China showed crackdowns can wipe hundreds of billions.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Core constraints push useful activity off-chain or to intermediaries; on-chain remains slow, costly, and adversarial.
  - Impact: Security relies on price appreciation and miner coordination; concentration and derivatives introduce sabotage incentives and geopolitical leverage.
  - Watch next: Post-halving fee market health; mining pool “unknown” share trends; concrete quantum-readiness plans and migration of high-value wallets.
