# Show HN: Autism Simulator

- TL;DR
    - A Show HN ‘Autism Simulator’ models workplace masking, energy, and daily choices. Commenters say some mechanics feel railroaded or conflated (breakfast, driving comfort, masking meter), and want source code to inspect/extend. Others explain how low energy, misophonia, and ADHD meds can make masking harder, but note medication and resilience vary widely. Some found it caricatured; others related to sensory overload and corporate lip service to neurodivergence. One proposes a companion ‘interruptions’ sim for context-switch costs. Creator plans to open-source soon.

- Comment pulse
    - Mechanics feel arbitrary → forced choices; masking meter mixes energy, willpower, disclosure; car comfort, breakfast railroading confuse intent — counterpoint: obstacles are narrative, not stats.
    - Energy gates masking → skipping breakfast or mis-timing meds can tank energy and bandwidth; optimal is predictable, easy calories — counterpoint: medication reliance feels overstated.
    - Lived reality varies → misophonia triggers flight; resilience masking persists despite low energy; companies tout support yet punish differences; request undiagnosed mode and source code.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Make state explicit, decouple attributes, and let players toggle traits; avoid moral framing; show uncertainty or random variance.
    - Impact: Open-sourcing invites autistic co-design, improving validity and letting others swap in workplace-interruption stories or alternative sensory profiles.
    - Watch next: Post code, document heuristics, and release telemetry-free builds with difficulty presets; publish playtest feedback and outcome benchmarks across personas.
