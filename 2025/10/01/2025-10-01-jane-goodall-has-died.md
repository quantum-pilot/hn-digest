- TL;DR
  - Jane Goodall, 91, died of natural causes in California. Her Gombe research overturned assumptions by documenting chimp toolmaking, hunting, complex emotions, and intergroup warfare, reshaping primatology and human self-understanding. A Leakey protégé, she popularized long-term, empathetic fieldwork, founded the Jane Goodall Institute, Roots & Shoots, and advocated globally for conservation. HN remembers her recent tireless outreach—talks and media appearances weeks ago—shares related pioneers like Anne Innis Dagg, and revisits debate over her population-growth comments versus equitable, pragmatic climate solutions.

- Comment pulse
  - She was still touring and broadcasting weeks ago → attendees recall high energy at 91.
  - Population growth quote criticized as deindustrialization advocacy → others say she coupled it with compassionate policy and stabilization — counterpoint: past doomsday predictions proved wrong.
  - Another pioneer: Anne Innis Dagg predated Goodall on wild giraffes → tenure bias obscured recognition — counterpoint: notoriety follows impact, not tenure.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Goodall fused rigorous observation with narrative, legitimizing empathy in field science without abandoning falsifiability.
  - Impact: Normalized longitudinal, named-subject primatology; shifted conservation toward community-led programs and youth engagement.
  - Watch next: Data releases from Gombe’s longitudinal dataset; policy traction for Roots & Shoots/TACARE models; renewed debates on anthropomorphism and animal personhood.
