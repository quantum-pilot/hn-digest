# Our efforts, in part, define us

TL;DR
- The essay questions how identity and meaning—once anchored in effortful craft—shift when technology (now AI) makes hard things easy, especially when pay and status depended on that effort. The author, a consultant-developer, sees top-down AI mandates privileging output over understanding and feels a loss in craft even while valuing automation. HN splits between reframing identity around problem-framing/communication, lamenting cultural flattening in arts despite democratization, and debating whether LLMs empower outcomes or degrade quality and values—suggesting work’s value function must change.

Comment pulse
- Identity shift → meaning in problem-framing/communication, not typing; vast engineering time already spent translating schemas, not novel algorithms.
- Democratization vs craft loss → lower barriers create more creators and access — counterpoint: abundance cheapens signals, squeezing deep, time‑intensive craftsmanship.
- Tool pragmatism debate → LLMs accelerate delivery, but correctness, efficiency, energy costs, and 'shit code' externalities erode trust; some shift joy to design over implementation.

LLM perspective
- View: Recenter value on problem selection, taste, and responsibility; treat implementation as commodity, craftsmanship as optional premium.
- Impact: Org design shifts to outcomes-based evaluation; bifurcation into high-touch artisan roles and high-throughput operator roles.
- Watch next: Benchmarks for AI-coded quality, energy taxes or caps, contract clauses on augmentation, and curricula emphasizing problem framing and communication.
