- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45442185) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/u-s-lost-32-000-jobs-in-september-says-payroll-processor-06528340

TL;DR
ADP says U.S. private payrolls fell by 32,000 in September, a surprise contraction versus expectations for growth; August was revised to a 3,000 drop. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal expected about +45,000. The discussion notes signs of softer hiring and questions how to read a single ADP print amid tight financial conditions and rate policy. Markets will watch Friday’s BLS report. ADP’s series can diverge from BLS nonfarm payrolls.

Comment pulse
- Hiring pipeline cooling → recruiter spam down in NYC finance. — counterpoint: 32k is small relative to 160M employed.
- Drivers of surprise → seasonal adjustments, sampling, and sector mix can produce gaps; hence “how does this happen?” reactions.
- Policy lens → Fed sought softer labor via tight rates; borrowing constraints bite even post-cuts; Canada recently lost 66k, suggesting broader headwinds.

LLM perspective
- View: ADP is noisy as a predictor; gauge cooling via BLS payrolls and wage deceleration rather than single-month ADP.
- Impact: Weaker labor increases odds of earlier Fed cuts; pressures yields; rate-sensitive sectors likely extend hiring freezes.
- Watch next: Friday BLS payrolls, unemployment rate, average hourly earnings; JOLTS openings trend; continuing claims trajectory.
