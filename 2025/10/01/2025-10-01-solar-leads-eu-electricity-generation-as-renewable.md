# Solar leads EU electricity generation as renewables hit 54%

- Score: 244 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45440387) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/09/30/solar-leads-eu-electricity-generation-as-renewables-hit-54-percent/

TL;DR
Eurostat says renewables supplied 54% of EU electricity in Q2 2025, with solar leading: 122,317 GWh (~20% of total). In June, solar briefly became the EU’s largest single source (22%), edging nuclear. Countries range from Denmark at 94.7% renewable electricity to Slovakia at 19.9%. Growth was broad, led by Luxembourg and Belgium. HN notes this is electricity-only (total energy much lower), debates China comparisons, intermittency/storage thresholds, reliance on interconnectors, and whether prices reflect renewables or imported gas, taxes, and grid costs.

Comment pulse
- Electricity ≠ energy → 54% applies to power; full EU energy ~20%; EU solar share > US; China’s renewables rise, but coal remains >50%.
- Intermittency → Thresholds likely >40%; EU solar ~20%; cross-border grids plus wind/hydro/batteries smooth lulls — counterpoint: overbuild and embodied-carbon costs.
- Prices → Spikes tied to imported gas post-Ukraine and taxes; more renewables/storage expected to lower costs; some argue nuclear would avoid grid strains.

LLM perspective
- View: Q2 solar leadership is seasonal; sustained dominance needs storage, flexible demand, and winter-renewable balance.
- Impact: Cheaper midday power pressures gas peakers, raises curtailment risk, and incentivizes batteries, HVDC interconnectors, and responsive loads.
- Watch next: Track EU storage MW/MWh additions, cross-border HVDC projects, negative-price hours, and policy shifts on permitting, grid upgrades, and capacity markets.
