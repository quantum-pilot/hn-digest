# Codeberg Reaches 300k Projects

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45439955) | Link: https://codeberg.org/

- TL;DR
  - Codeberg, the non-profit Forgejo-powered forge, crossed 300k projects and ~194k users, pitching privacy, EU hosting and community funding. HN compares it with GitHub and the Gitea/Forgejo split: some cite Forgejo’s activity, others say Gitea ships faster—release notes beat commit counts. Adoption friction persists: GitHub’s network effects, Actions and Sponsors versus Codeberg’s approval-gated CI and occasional outages. Many still self-host and mirror to publish. Concerns about AI training apply to any public code, not just GitHub.

- Comment pulse
  - Forgejo vs Gitea: activity vs outcomes → some cite Forgejo commits; others say Gitea ships more—compare release notes, not bot‑inflated metrics — counterpoint: post‑split spike expected.
  - Adoption inertia → GitHub offers Actions, generous CI, Sponsors, and familiarity; Codeberg CI needs approval and sees occasional DDoS‑related outages.
  - AI training worries → public code enables model training regardless of host; current US rulings tend to favor this interpretation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Milestone validates demand for privacy‑respecting, community‑run forges; differentiation now depends on reliability, CI ergonomics, and migration tooling.
  - Impact: More maintainers will mirror or move; EU‑hosted orgs gain an alternative meeting data‑sovereignty requirements.
  - Watch next: Forgejo vs Gitea roadmaps; Codeberg CI capacity, anti‑DDoS upgrades; funding growth and outages trend on the public status page.
