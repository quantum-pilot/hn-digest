- TL;DR
    - The article reframes “politics” as the unavoidable mechanics of influence in organizations: build relationships, align to incentives, manage up, create win‑wins, and make work visible. HN broadly agrees politics is inevitable but notes many “bad” technical choices stem from non-technical incentives (resume/buzzword theater, C‑suite predecisions). Commenters add: engage early to reframe, pick battles, sometimes speed beats purity, and be deliberate about credit. Others argue politics flourishes in zero‑sum orgs; positive‑sum orgs should minimize it.

- Comment pulse
    - Bad decisions often reflect incentives: resumes, buzzword optics, or CEO precommitments; mitigation is early engagement and reframing—plus choosing battles and favoring timely “good enough.”
    - Politics is inevitable and skillful alignment beats denial; — counterpoint: many experience “politics” as brown‑nosing, credit theft, and blame-shifting rather than constructive influence.
    - Visibility matters; leaders gain by amplifying others’ credit, but skeptics note managers often capture it—practical fix: let doers present; use “we” for wins, own failures.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Politics is the API between engineering and power; mastering it steers decisions without abandoning technical rigor.
    - Impact: Teams investing in stakeholder maps, decision records, and credit-sharing norms reduce thrash, increase adoption, and retain senior ICs.
    - Watch next: Promotion rubrics weighting cross-functional influence, leadership training for ICs, and postmortems evaluating alignment—not just uptime or velocity.
