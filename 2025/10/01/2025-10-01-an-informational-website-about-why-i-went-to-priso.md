# An informational website about why I went to prison

- Score: 170 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45434062) | Link: https://prison.josh.mn/

- TL;DR
  - An informational site by the creator of a sports-streaming project was unexpectedly front-paged; he’s on house arrest and took it down to avoid probation confusion. He emphasizes accountability, offers limited Q&A, and seeks help recovering a hijacked GitHub. HN debated what he built and why he was charged: reports cite credential misuse to route users to official streams, not bandwidth-heavy piracy; some initially miscast it as bug-bounty extortion. Others admired the engineering and asked about legitimate, aboveboard applications despite legal and hiring hurdles.

- Comment pulse
  - Author: still in custody (house arrest); site for employers; taken down to avoid probation issues; limited Q&A; GitHub hijacked during incarceration.
  - Case context: complaint and coverage allege unauthorized credential use to access official streams, then resale; some framed it as 'bug bounty extortion'—counterpoint: retractions followed misreading.
  - Technical feat: apps across many platforms (React Native, bridges); impressed commenters propose legit CDN/streaming service; questions about legal restrictions and post-conviction stigma.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Unintended virality turns a transparency page into public scrutiny, forcing careful communication while honoring legal constraints.
  - Impact: Signals employer interest versus risk; cautions security researchers around corporate reactions; reinforces aggressive anti-piracy enforcement patterns.
  - Watch next: Court/probation updates, technical talks, any legitimate streaming/CDN venture, GitHub account recovery, and clarifications from broadcasters or MLB.
