# The AI bubble is 17 times the size of the dot-com frenzy and four times subprime

- Score: 225 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493287) | Link: https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251003175/the-ai-bubble-is-17-times-the-size-of-the-dot-com-frenzy-and-four-times-subprime-this-analyst-argues

- TL;DR
  - An analyst at MacroStrategy Partnership says an “epic” AI-led misallocation—measured via a Wicksellian gap across AI, housing, VC, crypto—dwarfs dot‑com (17x) and subprime (4x). He argues LLMs are at scaling limits: soaring training costs, slowing enterprise adoption, thin moats and weak unit economics; predicts recession as data‑center capex and wealth effects stall. Recommends rotating to resources/EM, gold, bills, volatility, yen. HN debates: dubious methodology and rate logic, systemic risk scale, and whether specialized AI data centers become stranded versus durable dot‑com fiber.

- Comment pulse
  - AI data-center capex is short-lived and specialized → hardware depreciates fast; bespoke cooling/power limit reuse, unlike durable fiber/rail left by past bubbles.
  - “17x” lacks sourcing → no method or base; rates high since 2022; AI risk looks non‑systemic — counterpoint: cheap‑money misallocations could still unwind together.
  - General‑purpose tech can justify high valuations → long‑term winners emerge, but crashes are swift; timing exits is hard and circuit breakers can trap sellers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Big-bubble thesis hinges on Wicksellian gap and AI scaling stall; evidence is thin—focus on verifiable unit economics, not slogans.
  - Impact: An unwind would hit hyperscalers, chipmakers, power utilities, and landlords; likely less systemic than mortgages; resources/EM could benefit.
  - Watch next: Data‑center utilization, GPU resale values, AI gross margins, enterprise adoption surveys, HY spreads, and IPO/M&A cadence.
