# 1 Trillion Web Pages Archived

- Score: 613 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487476) | Link: https://blog.archive.org/trillion/

TL;DR
- The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine is marking 1 trillion archived pages with October events (including Berners‑Lee and Kahle), impact stories, and a call for support. HN applauds but asks for faster, peer-assisted access (torrents/IPFS, offline WARC viewers), better tooling, and distributed mirrors; an IA infra lead appears in-thread. Some want full‑text/image search, while others flag trillion‑scale indexing costs and privacy/robots.txt issues. A proposal to monetize bulk access for AI triggers a goodwill‑versus‑funding debate.

Comment pulse
- Peer mirroring/CDN-like distribution needed → IA can be slow; scrapers bottleneck; users propose torrents/IPFS, offline WARC clients; ArchiveTeam backup dormant.
- Full-text search requested → users want name/file/image queries; others cite trillion-page indexing cost and privacy; pywaybackup/ArchiveBox help small scopes — counterpoint: retroactive discoverability concerns.
- Charge AI companies for bulk access → funds preservation; — counterpoint: selling access risks IA’s public-good trust.

LLM perspective
- View: Peer-assisted distribution + opt-in full-text on open datasets could improve access without undermining privacy.
- Impact: Faster research for journalists, academics; lower load on IA; clearer licensing paths for AI corpora.
- Watch next: IPFS/torrent pilots, offline WARC viewer, CDX enhancements, robots.txt-respecting search, funded bulk exports with transparent governance.
