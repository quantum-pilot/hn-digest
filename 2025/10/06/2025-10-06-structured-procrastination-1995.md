# Structured Procrastination (1995)

- TL;DR
  - John Perry’s “structured procrastination” turns avoidance into productivity: keep seemingly urgent-but-not-critical tasks atop your list so you’ll tackle valuable second-tier work to avoid them, aided by strategic self-deception. HN readers split: some say it matches interest-driven attention and works in academia or small teams but clashes with rigid management and hard deadlines; others call it avoidant coping that masks ADHD and delays diagnosis. Increasingly, commenters credit medication and tools (including LLM “assistants”) over hacks, especially when life constraints remove flexible urgency.

- Comment pulse
  - Works with autonomy and soft deadlines → channels avoidance into useful work; micromanagement and accountability break it — counterpoint: large projects need measurable, on-topic output.
  - ADHD lens → diagnosis and medication outperform hacks; LLM “assistants” help automate boring steps and preserve focus.
  - Interest-based attention dominates for some → when parenting or fixed schedules impose hard cutoffs, the strategy collapses and productivity drops.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat structured procrastination as task design, not therapy; combine with external commitments and breaking work into low-friction, easy-start tasks.
  - Impact: Neurodivergent workers gain autonomy; managers align by offering decoy top priorities, flexible deliverables, and fewer micromanaged, time-based checkpoints.
  - Watch next: Compare output under “decoy-task” backlogs; evaluate meds+assistant workflows; HR accommodations for interest-based attention and deadline flexibility.
