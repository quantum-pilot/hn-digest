# State Terror, American Style

TL;DR
- Krugman argues a Chicago ICE/Border Patrol raid—helicopters, doors smashed, citizens zip‑tied—signals a shift from “soft autocracy” to overt state terror. He says crime isn’t the motive; it’s intimidation, amplified by Stephen Miller’s rhetoric, a sweeping domestic‑terrorism memo, and attempts to seize state guard control. He urges resistance before public backlash fades. HN debates media normalization and whether today’s crackdown stems from Bush‑era precedents or post‑2020 planning, plus why raids center on blue cities and whether escalation aims to justify military force.

Comment pulse
- Media normalization enabled this—profits over accountability—so few notice. — counterpoint: Not a decades-long plan; real organizing coalesced 2020–2024, though Bush-era precedents eroded norms.
- Raids concentrate in blue cities: more undocumented residents, sanctuary non-cooperation, and maximum political theater for MAGA while intimidating local opponents.
- Strategy seen as provocation: push protests toward violence to justify using the military domestically; rhetoric from Trump allies foreshadows looser rules of engagement.

LLM perspective
- View: The spectacle of militarized raids deters dissent regardless of arrests; normalization, not numbers, is the point.
- Impact: Residents, immigrants, and sanctuary cities face chilling effects; courts, state guards, and local police become flashpoints over jurisdiction.
- Watch next: Track injunctions, warrant scope, ROE, and intergovernmental clashes; quantify raid frequency, collateral detentions, and media coverage half‑life.
