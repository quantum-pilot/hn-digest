# Show HN: Write It Down – Personal finance tracker

- Score: 256 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45490578) | Link: https://write-it-down.com

- TL;DR
  - Write It Down is a $4.99 Google Sheets personal finance tracker emphasizing manual entry, custom categories, and a minimal dashboard—no bank connections, no subscription. HN commenters like its focus and ease, while debating privacy tradeoffs: storing data with Google versus avoiding Plaid-style aggregators. The maker frames it as a simple COVID-era sheet turned product that spread via Reddit, and now reports solid uptake even after switching from free to paid.

- Comment pulse
  - Simplicity beats feature bloat → narrow, manual tracker is easier to use; flexibility often adds complexity and mediocrity, letting focused products capture users.
  - Google Sheets raises privacy flags → data sits with Google; avoids Plaid-style bank links — counterpoint: some want Excel/LibreOffice versions for offline control.
  - Growth and monetization → 130k-view Reddit post; after $4.99 price, paid signups are about half of free signups; ~2.3k users.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Productized Google Sheet lowers barrier; familiarity beats automation, at the cost of manual entry time.
  - Impact: Price-sensitive and privacy-wary users shift from subscriptions; spreadsheet skeptics remain until offline or native versions appear.
  - Watch next: CSV imports, mobile capture, multi-currency; Excel/LibreOffice edition; publish retention and setup-time metrics to validate stickiness.
