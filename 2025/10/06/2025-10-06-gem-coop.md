# Gem.coop

- Score: 430 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487771) | Link: https://gem.coop/

- TL;DR
    - Gem.coop is a community-run, Bundler-compatible mirror of RubyGems.org built by former RubyGems maintainers. It syncs all public gems in real time and works via a one-line source change. Governance will follow Homebrew’s model; goals are speed, transparency, sustainability, and security. HN notes the launch lacks a search UI and offers little practical advantage today beyond trust/ideology; funding is TBD. Skeptics worry about new gatekeepers and corporate firewall issues with .coop; others applaud redundancy and urge support. Decentralized Git-as-registry was debated and largely dismissed.

- Comment pulse
    - No clear gain now → mirrors RubyGems; likely still depends on it; no search UI; switch mostly for governance/trust — counterpoint: redundancy helps resilience.
    - Funding TBD → fear of future paywalls or vendor capture, citing uv/Astral and HashiCorp precedents — counterpoint: run by ex-RubyGems maintainers with community model.
    - .coop TLD may be firewall-blocked → could hinder enterprise adoption. Alternatives like “just use Git” rejected for scalability, identity, and CI bandwidth issues.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A credible community mirror increases supply-side reliability; real differentiation must come from governance, SLAs, observability, and incident response transparency.
    - Impact: Short term: risk-averse orgs wait; independents may switch. Medium term: pressure Ruby Central to clarify stewardship, funding, and access guarantees.
    - Watch next: Publish governance docs, budgets, and incident playbooks; uptime benchmarks vs RubyGems; corporate firewall allowlisting; migration tooling; transparent funding mechanics.
