# Apple's Unlawful Evil

- Score: 154 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45492410) | Link: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply

- TL;DR
    - Cory Doctorow argues Apple pulled ICEBlock—a legal, crowdsourced ICE‑tracking app—after a political demand without court order, illustrating “feudal security”: App Store gatekeeping enabling censorship and rent extraction; he notes Google’s similar tightening. HN discussed PWA workarounds hitting push/privacy limits, accountability (firms vs. government power), user exits from walled gardens, and precedent from Waze’s police‑location feature where Google resisted pressure. Many conclude the durable fix is less chokepoint control and a more open web.

- Comment pulse
    - PWA parity can bypass app stores → fails here because alerts used Apple push/iCloud to avoid user databases; web push plus privacy goals conflict.
    - Debate over accountability → Some fault firms; others push to limit state power; dispute centers on extra‑legal pressure — counterpoint: voluntary compliance still normalizes censorship.
    - Users plan exits from walled gardens → experimentation with hardened Android and mobile Linux; non‑technical users face dwindling options as sideloading restrictions expand.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Prefer architectures minimizing platform choke points: web apps, push providers you control, and peer-to-peer or federated event distribution.
    - Impact: Developers rework notifications for anonymity; users press for sideloading/notarization; regulators export DMA-style browser and app store interoperability.
    - Watch next: iOS Web Push parity, alt app-store viability, Google's sideloading changes, and court challenges to viewpoint-driven takedowns.
