# AMD signs AI chip-supply deal with OpenAI, gives it option to take a 10% stake

- Score: 363 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45490549) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-with-openai-gives-it-option-take-10-stake-2025-10-06/

- TL;DR
    - AMD inked a multi-year deal to deliver ≈6 GW of GPUs to OpenAI starting 2026, and granted warrants letting OpenAI buy up to ~10% of AMD for $0.01/share as milestones are met. AMD guided to >$100B incremental revenue over four years; its stock jumped >34%. HN debates whether this is equity-subsidized demand that still needs vast capex and financing, or a strategic tie-up that could harden AMD’s AI stack and loosen Nvidia’s grip.

- Comment pulse
    - This isn’t financing → Warrants as collateral don’t ensure AMD’s stock rises; if OpenAI can’t monetize GPUs, lenders face falling collateral and unpaid debt.
    - Equity-subsidized orders → Warrants function like rebates to secure 6 GW, but 1 GW datacenter ≈ $50B; 6 GW implies unaffordable buildouts and power constraints.
    - CUDA alternative hopes → Joint work could mature AMD’s AI software and inference — counterpoint: may be OpenAI-specific, leaving tooling breadth and training competitiveness lagging.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Equity-for-capacity is a demand lock-in tactic, shifting vendor risk to investors while OpenAI hedges scarce GPU supply.
    - Impact: Expect accelerated ROCm, compilers, and PyTorch kernels; cloud pricing pressure; more power siting and grid deals from hyperscalers.
    - Watch next: Where the money and megawatts come from: project finance, sovereign funds, utilities, MI450 vs Vera Rubin benchmarks, warrant-vesting disclosures.
