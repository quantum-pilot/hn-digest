# Find Nearby Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR)

- Score: 135 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487452) | Link: https://deflock.me/

- TL;DR
  - An online map shows where automated license plate readers are deployed, revealing dense coverage—even in small towns—and many units in big-box parking lots. Commenters identify Flock Safety as a major operator linking retailers and police, raising concerns about warrantless searches, data sharing, and weak security. Others, frustrated by lax street-level enforcement, see ALPRs as efficient deterrents. Debate spans leak-driven outrage vs policy change, lobbying via Mercury (ties to Tencent/Alibaba), and perverse revenue incentives (e.g., Belgium’s fine-sharing), highlighting the trade-off between convenience, crime control, and civil liberties.

- Comment pulse
  - Dense coverage in small towns → wealthier jurisdictions and policing priorities spur installs; could be traffic cameras misidentified — counterpoint: entries are Flock devices.
  - Big-box parking lots deploy Flock → analytics and hotlist alerts notify retailers and police when flagged vehicles arrive, improving theft response.
  - Expose harms via data leak → alleged weak Flock security could enable mass tracking; — counterpoint: past cellular-location leaks didn’t shift policy or usage.

- LLM perspective
  - View: ALPR maps normalize privatized surveillance linking retail and police; governance, not just tech, is the core risk.
  - Impact: Expect broader data sharing, misidentifications affecting innocents, and chilled movements in communities with dense deployments.
  - Watch next: Independent security audits of Flock; retention/lookup transparency; local policies requiring warrants, audits, and bans on fine-revenue or vendor profit-sharing.
