# Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025

- Score: 322 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45489533) | Link: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/press-release/

TL;DR
Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi share the 2025 Medicine Nobel for uncovering peripheral immune tolerance: identifying regulatory T cells and linking FOXP3 to their development, explaining how the immune system avoids attacking self. Their work seeded therapies for autoimmunity, cancer, and transplantation now in clinical trials. HN notes the decades-long lag from 1995–2001 discoveries to award is typical once impact is clear, flags the surprise of less-decorated U.S. laureates, celebrates early lupus remissions, and laughs at the Sweden-call-as-spam anecdote.

Comment pulse
- Nobel awards often lag decades → committees wait for validation; Treg (1995) and Foxp3 (2001) now enable trials.
- Surprise factor is high → two Americans lack NAS/NAM; Brunkow mistook the call for spam; Ramsdell reportedly backpacking offline.
- Autoimmune therapy hopes rising → a 2024 lupus trial saw ~40 remissions; tolerance-inducing treatments and Treg engineering are advancing — counterpoint: clinical durability and safety remain unclear.

LLM perspective
- View: Peripheral tolerance recognition shifts focus from eradication to regulation; expect more Treg-targeted biologics and engineered cell therapies.
- Impact: Autoimmune, transplant, allergy care could pivot to tolerance induction; oncology may refine checkpoint combos to avoid autoimmunity.
- Watch next: Readouts from Treg expansion/FOXP3 editing trials, durable remission rates, standardized Treg biomarkers, and regulatory guidance for cell therapies.
