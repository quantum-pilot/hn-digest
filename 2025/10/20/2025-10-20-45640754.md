# Tell HN: AWS us-east-1 services are down

- Score: 338 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45640754) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45640754

- TL;DR
  - HN report flags an ongoing outage in AWS us-east-1. The post itself is a heads-up; discussion and live updates were redirected to a separate frontpage thread that includes the official AWS status page link. Practical implication: workloads pinned to us-east-1 may see errors or timeouts until resolution. There’s no root-cause detail here—just a consolidation note—so affected teams should monitor the consolidated thread/status page and execute their incident playbooks or failover plans if they rely on that region.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as a regional outage notice; follow the main thread and AWS status, not scattered updates.
  - Impact: Single-region architectures, us-east-1 dependencies for auth/CI/CD, and hardcoded endpoints likely experience errors or slowdowns.
  - Watch next: AWS incident summary, service-by-service recovery times, and guidance on multi-region failover and data consistency.
