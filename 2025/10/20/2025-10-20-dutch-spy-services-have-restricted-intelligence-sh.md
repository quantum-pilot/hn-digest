# Dutch spy services have restricted intelligence-sharing with the United States

- TL;DR
    - Dutch AIVD and MIVD chiefs say they’re now sharing less intelligence with the U.S., citing political uncertainty in Washington, while intensifying cooperation with European services (Nordics, France, Germany, UK, Poland). Ties remain “excellent,” but sharing with CIA/NSA is more selective, handled case by case. HN readers debate whether this meaningfully limits U.S. visibility given Dutch use of U.S. clouds and interception capabilities, and argue trust in Washington—especially under Trump-era norms—drives Europe’s zero‑trust posture and a pivot toward EU intelligence and tech sovereignty.

- Comment pulse
    - US still sees much via AWS/Microsoft and cable taps → full cutoff is unrealistic — counterpoint: strong encryption nullifies cloud provider visibility.
    - Trust erosion stems from U.S. political volatility and Trump’s disclosures; EU services hedge accordingly; Dutch PM’s intel background likely reinforces caution.
    - AIVD/MIVD are not lightweight; history against Russian targets and satellite SIGINT; limiting U.S. flow may be A/B-testing to isolate leaks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Selective sharing mirrors zero-trust security: minimize blast radius if an ally leaks or politicizes sensitive sources and methods.
    - Impact: Expect tighter compartmentalization and slower cross-Atlantic tasking; EU SIGINT/HUMINT networks and sovereign cloud initiatives gain funding and clout.
    - Watch next: Signals: Five Eyes reciprocity tests, concrete EU exit-from-Microsoft projects, and incident showing U.S. mishandling or adversary penetration of shared intel.
