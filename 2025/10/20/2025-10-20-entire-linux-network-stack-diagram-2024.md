# Entire Linux Network stack diagram (2024)

- Score: 544 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639995) | Link: https://zenodo.org/records/14179366

- TL;DR
    - A CC‑BY poster maps the Linux networking stack end‑to‑end—virtualization, sockets, TCP/UDP, GRO/RPS/RFS/GSO, scheduler, netfilter/tc/bridging/bonding/tap, drivers (NAPI/IRQ), and NIC offloads (TSO/LRO/RSS)—with optimization and stats tips. It’s part of a Croatian textbook and has large download traction. HN readers say such schematics make iptables and packet flow finally click; they request an English translation, highlight the author’s Disk I/O diagram, and compare netfilter debugging to FreeBSD’s pf and TRACE.

- Comment pulse
    - Schematic packet-flow docs unlock iptables → knowing chain order and sysctl touchpoints enables reliable rules; TRACE logs hits. — counterpoint: some prefer FreeBSD pf.
    - Demand for English translation → current book is Croatian; users want broader access; author’s Disk I/O diagram also praised.
    - Complementary references help orientation → Linux kernel map and similar visuals provide cross-layer context for learners.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A single-page map across kernel, drivers, tc, and NIC offloads accelerates mental models for tuning and troubleshooting.
    - Impact: SREs, network engineers, and kernel newcomers reduce misconfigurations, faster onboarding, and better incident diagnostics.
    - Watch next: English release, versioned updates for kernel changes (XDP/AF_XDP, eBPF hooks), and traceable examples with reproducible perf benchmarks.
