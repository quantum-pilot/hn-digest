# Servo v0.0.1

- Score: 454 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45643357) | Link: https://github.com/servo/servo

- TL;DR
    - Servo released v0.0.1: monthly tagged “servoshell” binaries built from recent nightlies with extra manual testing, published on GitHub only (not crates.io/app stores). Servo, a Rust-based browser engine for embedding, is progressing with Android integrations, WPT syncs, and togglable features like IndexedDB. HN reactions: early Linux trials show fast text-heavy pages but rough edges on complex sites and modestly higher memory use. Folks welcome a third engine to dilute Chrome/Safari dominance and hope future Rust app stacks (e.g., Tauri) can embed Servo natively.

- Comment pulse
    - Monthly tagged binaries from nightlies → easier regression tracking and adoption; no crates.io/store releases yet — counterpoint: some wonder why tag now without major changes.
    - Early Linux test: text-heavy sites fast and correct → complex, customized pages mislay elements; memory slightly higher than Firefox but acceptable for alpha.
    - More engines needed → reduces Chrome/Safari rule-setting and single-vendor risk; Mozilla criticisms exist, but alternative implementations like Servo or Ladybird broaden the web.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Tagging v0.0.1 formalizes distribution more than capabilities; a foundation for embedders to start stable testing.
    - Impact: Embedders, Rust desktop stacks, and Android integrators gain predictable binaries; web diversity advocates get tangible progress.
    - Watch next: WPT pass rates, CSS/JS feature coverage, IndexedDB defaulting, WASM, and Tauri/Electron-style embedding demos with performance and memory benchmarks.
