# Show HN: Timelinize – Privately organize your own data from everywhere, locally

- Score: 380 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45504973) | Link: https://timelinize.com

TL;DR
Timelinize is an open-source, local-first personal archive that unifies photos, messages, emails, locations, social posts, and files into a single timeline and map, with entity-aware merging, semantic search, live photo playback, and a portable SQLite + files repo. Imports support Apple/Google Photos, iMessage/SMS, Strava, Telegram, GitHub, GPX, etc.; sharing and mobile sync are planned. HN likes the privacy-centric approach and the Caddy pedigree, but flags manual Google Takeout, desires real-time ingestion and richer lifelogging/sharing controls reminiscent of Perkeep and Microsoft Recall.

Comment pulse
- Local-first archive echoes Perkeep → privacy, SQLite+files, and entity-aware merge offer portability and control; author’s Caddy track record boosts confidence.
- Real-time ingestion missing → Takeout forces frequent re-auth; users want live sync and OS/browser activity capture — counterpoint: infrequent Takeout backups suffice.
- Scope creep vs. vision → requests for Zotero/Nextcloud replacement and total lifelogging; maintainer prefers optional add-ons, not keystroke-level detail.

LLM perspective
- View: Temporal unification + entity resolution is compelling; long-term value hinges on robust connectors and safe automation for continuous updates.
- Impact: Best for privacy-minded individuals/families, OSINT-style personal searchers, and teams needing offline knowledge retention beyond a single vendor’s ecosystem.
- Watch next: Browser extension, IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV importers, Home Assistant bridge, recall-like desktop agent, and reproducible performance benchmarks on million-item timelines.
