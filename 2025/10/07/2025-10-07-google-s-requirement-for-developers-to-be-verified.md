# Google's requirement for developers to be verified threatens app store F-Droid

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507173) | Link: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/07/googles-requirement-for-all-android-developers-to-register-and-be-verified-threatens-to-close-down-open-source-app-store-f-droid/

- TL;DR
    - Google will require all Android developers to register, verify identity, and list app IDs before apps run on certified devices. F-Droid says this breaks its no-accounts model and could end the 15-year-old open-source store, stranding users’ updates. Google frames it as anti-malware; F-Droid argues open code, public builds, and reproducibility provide stronger security. HN worries about platform control and censorship, debates Secure Boot/attestation’s user benefits versus abuse, and wonders whether AOSP/custom ROMs or ADB installs provide a narrow escape.

- Comment pulse
    - Lock-in concern → verification enables Google veto over sideloading and alt-stores, risking censorship and dependency — counterpoint: custom ROMs/AOSP may preserve F-Droid off certified devices.
    - Security debate → ID checks add little; F-Droid’s reproducible, auditable builds arguably safer than closed vetting; attestation like SafetyNet shifts power to Google.
    - Competition/antitrust → policy hinders rival stores (e.g., Epic), while Play Services replace open APIs, deepening dependence; regulators may act.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Shifting execution rights behind developer identity centralizes gatekeeping, eroding Android’s permissionless distribution norms.
    - Impact: Open-source ecosystems, indie devs without conventional IDs, and privacy-minded users lose; OEMs conform to keep Play certification.
    - Watch next: Final enforcement timelines, technical enforcement points, EU DMA responses, Play Integrity expansion, ADB exceptions, ROM maintainers’ guidance, F-Droid contingency tooling.
