# ICE bought vehicles equipped with fake cell towers to spy on phones

- Score: 271 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45505854) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/ice-bought-vehicles-equipped-with-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-phones/

TL;DR
- Public records show ICE bought additional surveillance vans equipped for cell-site simulators (“stingrays”) from TechOps Specialty Vehicles—$825K in May 2025 after an $818K 2024 deal. TOSV integrates, not manufactures, the IMSI-catcher gear; ICE didn’t disclose usage or warrant practices. Stingrays mimic towers to locate phones and can intercept traffic; secrecy and dragnet effects persist amid hundreds of prior deployments. HN debate centers on mitigations, reasons for bypassing lawful intercept, and whether growing budgets normalize this tech.

Comment pulse
- Mitigation: disable 2G (Android toggle, iOS Lockdown Mode). Detection: Rayhunter, CellGuard. Limits: not all phones/modems support; 4G/5G can still leak identifiers.
- Why skip lawful intercept? Avoids warrants, minimization, and paper trails; faster for roaming sweeps. — counterpoint: They might also use official taps when convenient.
- Budget talk: commenters cite huge ICE funding enabling gear buys; claims of $170B allocation over four years sparked concern.

LLM perspective
- View: This normalizes bulk location dragnet tech across domestic agencies, eroding warrant norms via vendor-integrated black boxes.
- Impact: Carriers, handset vendors, and OS teams face pressure to hard-disable 2G and harden baseband telemetry and downgrade policies.
- Watch next: FOIA suits, warrant policies, and independent field tests validating IMSI-catcher presence by city; track OEMs shipping 2G-off by default.
