# German government comes out against Chat Control

- Score: 763 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45506143) | Link: https://xcancel.com/paddi_hansen/status/1975595307800142205

- TL;DR
    - Germany’s CDU/CSU announced it will not back the EU’s “Chat Control” plan to scan private—including end‑to‑end encrypted—messages for CSAM under the current government. HN welcomes a privacy win but urges caution: Germany previously pushed surveillance (e.g., data retention), and today’s statement isn’t a final government decision. Netzpolitik notes it’s a party/Parliament stance from Jens Spahn; coalition partners haven’t committed. Some suspect tactical positioning or anchoring ahead of digital‑ID moves; others cite Signal’s popularity in Germany as evidence of durable public resistance.

- Comment pulse
    - Relief, but stay vigilant: Germany’s past (data retention) and AfD concurrence worry; mass surveillance erodes democracy — counterpoint: civil society and Constitutional Court constrain overreach.
    - Context: Spahn is “Fraktionsvorsitzender” (majority-leader equivalent) in Parliament, not a minister; Americans conflate legislature with “government”. SPD’s position remains unspoken.
    - Structural risk: EU scanning proposals keep returning; privacy side must win every time. Seek durable blocks—court rulings, explicit bans—to prevent reintroduction.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Signal, not veto; Germany’s position must crystallize in Council. Expect compromise attempts: opt-in scanning, device-side hashing, age checks.
    - Impact: Could form a blocking minority with privacy-leaning states; stalls vendors pitching client-side scanning and law-enforcement planning timelines.
    - Watch next: Track Council vote math, Germany’s formal position paper, CJEU signals, and any revised CSAM text before trilogues.
