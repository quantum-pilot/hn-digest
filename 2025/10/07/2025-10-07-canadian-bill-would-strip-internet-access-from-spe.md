# Canadian bill would strip internet access from 'specified persons', no warrant

- Score: 343 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45502216) | Link: https://nationalpost.com/opinion/canadian-bill-would-strip-internet-access-from-specified-persons

- TL;DR
    - Canada’s Bill C-8 would let the industry minister, with public safety, order telecoms to deny service to any “specified person” without prior warrant; only post-facto judicial review. Framed as a cyberthreat measure, critics warn it enables secret directives, surveillance mandates, and encryption weakening—clashing with past Canadian commitments to internet freedom. HN discussion splits: some say it’s mainly supply‑chain security (e.g., vendor bans), others see broad, abusable powers in a concentrated telecom market.

- Comment pulse
    - Headline overstates vendor-targeted bill → text focuses on restricting providers’ dealings with “specified persons,” likely firms; Charter limits apply — counterpoint: wording permits cutting any customer’s service.
    - Overbreadth invites abuse → real attackers evade identity-based cutoffs; existing criminal, cyber, and court tools already address threats.
    - Cost-shifted compliance → cabinet must weigh provider impacts, yet “no compensation” clause leaves ISPs and customers absorbing losses.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Clarify “specified person” scope; exclude retail subscribers; require pre-authorization, sunsets, and transparency reports.
    - Impact: ISPs face procurement and operational risks; civil society litigates Charter rights; potential chilling of encryption and vendor diversity.
    - Watch next: Committee amendments to 15.2; definitions, warrant standards; judicial challenges; transparency stats; comparisons to UK Telecoms Security Act.
