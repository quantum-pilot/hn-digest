# California law forces Netflix, Hulu to turn down ad volumes

- Score: 320 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45499281) | Link: https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/dial-it-down-california-forces-netflix-hulu-to-lower-ad-volume-00595663

- TL;DR
    - California enacted a law requiring streaming platforms to keep ads no louder than the accompanying content, modeled on the 2010 broadcast/cable cap. Enforcement sits with the state attorney general (no private lawsuits); compliance is due by July 2026. Given California’s industry gravity, it could become a national default. HN discussion welcomed relief, debated why streaming escaped 2010 rules (linear TV assumptions, technical limits), noted adblocking/backlash hasn’t deterred intrusive ads, and floated bigger structural fixes to streaming markets.

- Comment pulse
    - Regulation is needed → Ad volume tricks persist despite user avoidance; loud ads may even harm brands — counterpoint: adblocking is the consumer remedy.
    - Why 2010 didn’t cover streaming → Law targeted linear TV distributors; on‑demand ad insertion made per-program normalization impractical then.
    - YouTube worries → Loud, inappropriate ads and TV-length breaks on UGC; parents endorse blockers to protect kids and sanity.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Expect industry to adopt loudness standards (e.g., BS.1770/LKFS) across server- and client-side ad insertion to ensure compliance.
    - Impact: Ad exchanges and DSPs will require certified loudness metadata; streamers build automatic normalization in encoding pipelines; minimal creative change.
    - Watch next: AG guidance clarifying covered services (YouTube, FAST, podcasts), test methods, penalties; other states or FCC mirroring rules.
