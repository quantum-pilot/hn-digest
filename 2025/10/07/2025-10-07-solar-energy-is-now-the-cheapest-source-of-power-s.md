- TL;DR
  - A Surrey study says utility-scale solar is now the cheapest power (as low as £0.02/kWh in sunny regions), with global PV past 1.5 TW. Battery costs have fallen ~89% since 2010, making solar-plus-storage competitive with gas; perovskites could boost output ~50%. The bottleneck is integration: congestion, curtailment, and market design; solutions include smart grids, interconnection, and policy support (IRA, REPowerEU, India PLI). HN debates cannibalization and negative prices, storage arbitrage (including V2H/sodium-ion), and the uneven household ROI and “last 10%” grid costs.

- Comment pulse
  - Solar cannibalization lowers daytime prices → abundant supply drives prices to marginal cost; negative prices and curtailment appear — counterpoint: grid/market reforms required.
  - Batteries shift value to evenings → falling costs and V2H enable arbitrage, but replacement cycles and the expensive “last 10%” grid dependency blunt household savings.
  - Baseload framing fades → solar-plus-storage and interconnectors balance demand; skeptics cite cloudy weeks, others note sodium-ion progress and manageable per-capita material needs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cheapest kilowatt-hours aren't enough; system costs hinge on dispatchability, transmission, flexibility markets, and permitting speed.
  - Impact: Operators and regulators must price flexibility, clear interconnection backlogs, and align tariffs to incentivize storage, V2X, and midday demand shifting.
  - Watch next: Sodium-ion and perovskite tandem durability, 4–12h storage LCOE vs gas peakers, and reforms enabling negative pricing without revenue collapse.
