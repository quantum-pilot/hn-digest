# User ban controversy reveals Bluesky’s decentralized aspiration isn’t reality

- Score: 217 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507880) | Link: https://plus.flux.community/p/banning-controversy-reveals-blueskys

- TL;DR
    - A Blacksky user’s ban revealed Bluesky’s “decentralized” ATProto still hinges on Bluesky’s own AppView and moderation labels. Despite open-sourcing PDS/relay/labeler components, performance and tooling gaps—especially Ozone’s usability—keep third-party stacks dependent, letting a central decision suppress content across an “independent” service. ATProto still enables identity portability beyond ActivityPub/Mastodon, but federation isn’t real yet. HN debates center on tech immaturity versus Web3-like choke points, and on ideology versus userbase/UX in determining which social networks succeed.

- Comment pulse
    - Not decentralized → Bluesky’s default AppView subscribes to its own labeler, can’t be disabled; bans cascade to dependents—counterpoint: independent AppViews could emerge as tooling matures.
    - Userbase trumps architecture → Most users prefer centralized UX and moderation; decentralization isn’t a selling point beyond technologists, shaping platform priorities.
    - ATProto vs Mastodon → Bluesky preserves identity across servers and reduces the “blast radius”; Mastodon moves followers but not posts, and host cooperation is required.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Federation exists on paper; the default AppView/moderation pipeline remains the practical choke point.
    - Impact: Independent operators and moderators face dependency risk; users banned by Bluesky lack meaningful alternatives; Bluesky’s credibility on decentralization erodes.
    - Watch next: Usable Ozone or fork; fast third-party AppView with optional Bluesky labels; ban notifications for external PDS; benchmarks from Slices.
