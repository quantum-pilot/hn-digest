# No account? No Windows 11, Microsoft says as another loophole snaps shut

- Score: 329 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45503726) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/windows_11_local_account_loophole/

- TL;DR
  - Microsoft is closing another Windows 11 setup loophole: Insider builds disable the local-account command (start ms-cxh:localonly) and require internet and a Microsoft account to finish OOBE. Redmond says bypasses skip critical configuration and cites security/UX. Managed/enterprise deployments aren’t directly affected; this mainly hits unmanaged installs. Earlier, Microsoft removed bypassnro.cmd (no-internet setup). Workarounds remain (e.g., unattended installs), but are more complex. Net effect: running Windows 11 without an MS account is getting impractical; privacy-minded users may eye alternative OSes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This formalizes Microsoft’s cloud lock-in via OOBE, driving OneDrive/Microsoft 365 attach and telemetry consistency.
  - Impact: Home users, small shops, refurbishers, offline deployments; enterprises with Autopilot/AD unaffected.
  - Watch next: Production rollout timing; whether ISO/offline modes stay; growth in Linux adoption or Windows 10 hang-on.
