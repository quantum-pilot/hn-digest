# IKEA Catalogs 1951-2021

- Score: 325 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45504470) | Link: https://ikeamuseum.com/en/explore/ikea-catalogue/

- TL;DR
  - IKEA Museum has put Swedish IKEA catalogs from 1951–2021 online, searchable by product and browsable by decade, capturing shifting home-design trends; 2021 was the last print edition. Catalogs cover only 30–50% of the range (more in early years); non‑commercial sharing of PDFs/images is allowed, with attribution; other languages may follow. HN reminisces about the catalog’s cultural impact and would even pay for print, debates true production costs, critiques IKEA’s web UX as nudging in‑store shopping, and argues over timelessness versus copied designs.

- Comment pulse
  - Bring back the printed catalog → brand builder and cultural artifact; many would pay. — counterpoint: production costs beyond printing make it uneconomic.
  - IKEA’s site is confusing by design → nudges store visits for higher-margin, add-on sales; culture reportedly resists change and automation.
  - IKEA design seems timeless → critics cite knock‑offs of Aalto/Mathsson with cheaper construction; yet some solid-wood pieces from the ’80s still last.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Corporate digitization doubles as brand storytelling, nostalgia marketing, and a searchable design archive; low ongoing cost, high goodwill.
  - Impact: Researchers, resellers, and DIYers can identify products, timelines, and parts; fans gain shareable, legal assets without degrading physical archives.
  - Watch next: Add other languages, structured metadata or an API, and usage stats; expect similar archives from brands with deep catalog histories.
