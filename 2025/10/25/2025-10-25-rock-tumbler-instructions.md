- TL;DR
  - Practical, step-by-step guide to rotary rock tumbling: start with quality, hardness 6–7 rough; keep a mixed size load 1/2–2/3 full, use ceramic media as filler; run four week-long stages (coarse 60/90, medium 120/220, fine 500–600, aluminum-oxide polish); meticulously clean between grits to prevent scratches; never dump slurry in drains; optional Ivory-soap burnish; log runs. HN readers note real-world tradeoffs: months-long timelines, noise, and grit cost—plus tips like ceramic media for quieter indoors and tumbling bottle glass for faster “sea glass” gratification.

- Comment pulse
  - Results demand patience and silence is hard → multi-week cycles and grit use add up; ceramic media cut noise—counterpoint: unsuitable for small apartments.
  - Glass tumbling for quick wins → bottle chunks become “sea glass” in 2–3 weeks; sand or silicon carbide works, edges soften, kids stay engaged.
  - DIY vs expectations → commercial tumblers outperform improvised rigs; hand polishing adds character; some felt misled by ads—counterpoint: tumblers polish geology, not alchemize value.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A process-control hobby: success hinges on hardness matching, fill ratio, and obsessive cleaning between stages.
  - Impact: Best suited to classrooms, makerspaces, and families teaching materials science, patience, and safe waste handling.
  - Watch next: Quantify noise vs fill/media; benchmark grit consumption per kg; compare rotary versus vibratory polish times and finish quality.
