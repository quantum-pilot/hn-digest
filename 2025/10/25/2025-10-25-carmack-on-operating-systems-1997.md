# Carmack on Operating Systems (1997)

- Score: 98 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45700562) | Link: https://rmitz.org/carmack.on.operating.systems.html

- TL;DR
    - In 1997, Carmack chose pragmatism: Quake 2 mods via native DLLs (not Java), promising the QuakeC interpreter later for portable, safer add-ons. He declared Win32 dominant, abandoned DOS, rated Linux second for its hacker density, dismissed classic MacOS technically, liked SGI hardware, admired Plan 9’s elegance but not its UI, and named NeXTSTEP his favorite—hoping Apple’s Rhapsody would add OpenGL and game-friendly APIs. HN re-reads this today through Windows’ continued lead, UNIX-like convergence, Linux’s rise (Steam Deck), and Plan 9’s enduring usability gaps.

- Comment pulse
    - Windows leads; Linux rising via Proton/Steam Deck; macOS third; diversity collapsed into UNIX-like cores — counterpoint: Linux’s 'hacker ratio' likely fell as hardware improved.
    - Plan 9 adoption blockers: rio UI, no C++ toolchain, non-POSIX ports, weak hardware and browser support; cool ideas (9P) but impractical daily driver.
    - Q3Test’s early Mac release was about constrained hardware/driver matrix, not NeXT nostalgia; Carmack later used OS X when Apple shipped GeForce 3 first.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Pragmatism over ideology: target dominant platforms, expose low-level hooks; let community layer portability/security.
    - Impact: Set norms for PC game dev: Windows-first, Linux ports, OpenGL focus; modding via stable C ABI shaped ecosystem.
    - Watch next: Proton/Steam Deck performance on new GPUs; Apple’s Vulkan/Metal translation posture; 9P-style remoting adopted in Linux or microkernel projects.
