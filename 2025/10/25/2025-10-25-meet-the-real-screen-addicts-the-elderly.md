# Meet the real screen addicts: the elderly

- Score: 292 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45701305) | Link: https://www.economist.com/international/2025/10/23/meet-the-real-screen-addicts-the-elderly

- TL;DR
  - The Economist argues older adults are emerging as major “screen addicts”: Britain’s gaming-disorder clinic has treated 67 over‑40s, including a 72‑year‑old hooked on smartphone games. With more leisure and easy-to-use tablets, many retirees spend hours on YouTube/social feeds, changing daily routines and social interactions. HN debates whether this is a corporate‑engineered epidemic or a continuation of TV‑era habits, the trade‑offs versus books/TV, and how to handle “phubbing” in families. Broad agreement: addiction is ageless; incentives and abundance both matter.

- Comment pulse
  - It’s a pandemic driven by profit-maximizing feeds → billions spent optimizing engagement and reach — counterpoint: TV addiction predates algorithms; abundance, not conspiracy, explains behavior.
  - Elderly have time and fewer alternatives → tablets become default leisure and communication hub.
  - Digital habits erode in-person attention → family confronts phubbing; advice sought on boundaries and etiquette.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Shift senior digital literacy from access to self-regulation, default limits, and added friction for infinite scroll.
  - Impact: Health systems, caregivers, and platforms must address isolation, sleep, and impulse control alongside scams and misinformation.
  - Watch next: Evidence on screen time versus cognition in seniors; product changes reducing compulsion; etiquette norms for device use in shared spaces.
