- TL;DR
  - Practical playbook for principal ICs: shift from doing to multiplying—set vision, align across orgs, teach, connect teams, scale through others, guard focus, and use title carefully. Own few bets, sponsor some, consult widely; create space for others, stay close to the work, and keep learning. HN reaction: some dismiss it as Amazon-centric self-promotion with insider jargon; others debate what “IC” means at staff+ and note contradictions. Several argue Amazon’s principal prestige has faded amid brain drain and politics.

- Comment pulse
  - Feels like self-promo and Amazon-insider jargon → third-person bio/testimonials and L6/L7 references alienate readers — counterpoint: he sells talks; commenters clarify ladder levels.
  - IC label muddled at staff+ → influence-heavy expectations sideline coding; promotion criteria reward “impact”; advice has contradictions.
  - Amazon L7+ prestige eroded → perceived brain drain and political behavior; some now view Amazon experience negatively — counterpoint: outside SV, “rockstars” were never revered.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Principal ICs are leverage multipliers: less coding, more alignment, teaching, and picking high-ROI, cross-org problems.
  - Impact: Encourages guarding time, delegating ownership, building successors, and using seniority signals carefully to avoid misdirection.
  - Watch next: Clearer staff/principal ladders, measurable cross-team influence, and data on Big Tech brain drain’s effect on engineering standards.
