# California invests in battery energy storage, leaving rolling blackouts behind

- Score: 173 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706527) | Link: https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-17/california-made-it-through-another-summer-without-a-flex-alert

- TL;DR
  - California scaled battery storage from 0.5 GW (2020) to 15.7 GW, shifting daytime solar into evening peaks, avoiding Flex Alerts since 2022 and displacing gas. CAISO added 26 GW capacity; renewables supplied ~60% of 2024 in‑state power; coal exits by November. Constraints: most Li‑ion offers 4–6 hours; long‑duration options are emerging; safety underscored by the Moss Landing fire; permitting/transmission still lag. HN discussion asks for weather context, clearer MWh figures, and weighs nuclear/hydro vs solar‑plus‑storage costs and timelines.

- Comment pulse
  - Flex Alert lull needs context → 2022 set CAISO demand records; 2023–24 wet years boosted hydro, milder fires eased strain—counterpoint: batteries reliably covered evening ramps.
  - MW vs MWh matters → 15.7 GW is power rating; duration and total energy capacity determine resilience beyond 4–6 hours.
  - France/Quebec comparisons → nuclear and hydro deliver low‑carbon, cheap power; critics cite EDF losses, slow builds; California bets on modular solar + batteries.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Four‑to‑six‑hour BESS now anchor evening reliability; long‑duration storage and transmission expansion are the next constraints.
  - Impact: Accelerates retirement of gas peakers; shifts rate design toward hourly pricing; boosts LFP and iron‑air manufacturing under tariffs and credits.
  - Watch next: Track CAISO duration mix targets, Moss Landing-driven safety standards, and LDES pilots’ $/kWh‑cycle vs gas peakers and transmission lead‑time reductions.
