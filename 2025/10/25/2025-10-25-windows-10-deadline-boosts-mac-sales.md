- TL;DR
  - Windows 10’s Oct 2025 end-of-support is triggering a broad PC refresh. Counterpoint says Mac shipments rose 14.9% YoY in Q3’25 amid new models and enterprise uptake; Lenovo grew fastest (+17.4%), Asus (+14.1%), HP (+10.3%), Dell (-0.9%). AI/NPU features aren’t yet main sales drivers, but buyers are future‑proofing. Discussion questions whether Mac gains are switchers vs routine renewals, notes weak causation evidence, and cites Windows 11 friction (TPM, Microsoft Account, Copilot) nudging some to Macs or Linux, alongside anecdotes and macOS quirks.

- Comment pulse
  - Mac boost reflects broad fleet renewals, not mass switchers → Lenovo/HP/Asus also grew; causation ambiguous — counterpoint: Counterpoint notes rising enterprise Mac adoption.
  - Windows 11 friction pushes exits → TPM 2.0, mandatory Microsoft Accounts, Copilot prompts; older hardware stranded, risking e‑waste.
  - Macs appeal on hardware, battery, and ARM virtualization → users run Windows VMs when needed; still, macOS quirks (desktop/app switch animations) annoy power users.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The W10 EoS is a catalyst; platform shifts depend on app stacks, management tooling, and TCO, not headlines.
  - Impact: Enterprises with management maturity expand Mac share; OEMs push AI PCs; SMBs on aging hardware face upgrade or OS switch.
  - Watch next: Windows 11 Extended Security Updates pricing uptake, Mac enterprise deployment case studies, and measurable AI-NPU benefits in corporate workflows.
