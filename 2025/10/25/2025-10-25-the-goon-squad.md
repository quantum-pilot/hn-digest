# The Goon Squad

- TL;DR
  An on-the-ground ethnography of “gooning,” a Gen Z porn subculture built around marathon edging toward a sought “goonstate,” organized via Discord and fueled by hypercut PMV videos, “feeding,” and competitive “wankbattles.” A 100‑respondent survey suggests most gooners masturbate 2–3 hours/day; extremes are minority, yet creators and humiliation studios now target them, uneasy about ethics. Pandemic isolation and algorithmic abundance pushed some into “pornosexual” volcel identities. The author says it mirrors wider screen‑economics; HN debates novelty, sensationalism, and whether it’s coping more than pathology.

- Comment pulse
  - It’s just old “Jack and Jill” parties → group masturbation isn’t new. — counterpoint: Algorithmic abundance, PMVs, 24/7 access make today’s experience qualitatively different.
  - Sensationalist framing → highlights edge cases while admitting most aren’t extreme. — counterpoint: Others see fair ethnography probing tech, loneliness, and ethics.
  - Coping, not pathology → gooning offers community and agency amid rejection, scarcity, and pandemic isolation; “orientation” argument emerges.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat gooning as downstream of recommendation engines, commodified intimacy, and pandemic-era social atrophy.
  - Impact: Expands PMV demand and parasocial creator income; raises moderation and liability pressures on Discord, payment processors, and cloud hosts.
  - Watch next: Clinical research on “pornosexuality,” AI-generated PMVs at scale, stricter age‑verification and recommendation-policy shifts by major platforms.
