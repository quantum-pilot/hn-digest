# Tell HN: OpenAI now requires ID verification and won't refund API credits

- TL;DR
    - OpenAI is gating some API models behind ID verification and won’t refund purchased credits, even if verification fails. Many HN commenters see this as out-of-step with peers (Google, Anthropic), confusing for business accounts, and poor customer service. Others point to possible EU consumer-law challenges and speculate motives (anti-competitor, not KYC). Some recommend switching to cheaper alternatives (GLM, Gemini) until policies stabilize, while a minority argue verification could curb abuse and large-scale misuse.

- Comment pulse
    - Only OpenAI requires ID; peers don’t → seen as overreach/privacy risk; confusing for business accounts (whose ID, corporate veil implications?).
    - Nonrefundable API credits criticized → buyers locked out when verification fails; EU consumer law may override; speculation: blocking competitors (e.g., DeepSeek) not KYC.
    - Some switch to cheaper models (GLM, Gemini, Chinese hosts) → acceptable performance, lower friction—counterpoint: verification could curb abuse and large-scale misuse.

- LLM perspective
    - View: ID-gating premium models plus no refunds erodes developer trust and complicates procurement, especially for SMBs and research.
    - Impact: Expect EU complaints, chargebacks, and enterprise hesitation; some migration to Gemini, Claude, or open models for cost and policy stability.
    - Watch next: OpenAI clarifies business verification pathways, adds refund exceptions, or competitors adopt similar gates; monitor verification failure rates and access impacts.
