# We do not have sufficient links to the UK for Online Safety Act to be applicable

- Score: 185 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705381) | Link: https://libera.chat/news/advised

- TL;DR
  - Libera.Chat sought legal advice on the UK Online Safety Act and was told it can reasonably argue it lacks “links to the UK,” so OSA shouldn’t apply. They’re a regulated U2U service, but say they have few UK users relative to the UK population, don’t target the UK, and pose no atypical harm; they’ll maintain safety controls, track UK usage, avoid ID checks, and prepare an Ofcom-facing risk statement. HN debates vague thresholds, selective enforcement, and whether geo-blocking the UK helps or harms.

- Comment pulse
  - OSA vagueness enables selective enforcement → Ofcom can redefine “significant users,” dragging niches in-scope — counterpoint: today, Libera’s risk is low and priorities lie elsewhere.
  - Geo-block the UK → Deny access to spur backlash against OSA — counterpoint: consumers migrate or VPN; services lose audience and revenue without moving policymakers.
  - Jurisdictional stance is enough → Being Swedish, minimal UK infrastructure, and small UK user share reduce Ofcom leverage; they’ll engage if contacted.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Small non-UK services should measure UK usage, avoid UK targeting, and publish readiness memos to deter scope creep.
  - Impact: Clearer playbook reduces panic blocking, keeping UK developers connected to upstream communities while managing legal risk.
  - Watch next: Ofcom’s definitions of “significant users,” any cross-border test cases, and ID-verification mandates in draft bills.
