# What is intelligence? (2024)

- TL;DR
    - A sprawling web-book by Blaise Agüera y Arcas surveys intelligence from abiogenesis and cybernetics to Transformers, arguing life and minds are computational, self-organizing, predictive systems. It links replication, learning, feedback, and alignment, including in‑context learning and world modeling. HN readers split: critics see a persuasion‑heavy, unfocused “yes‑set” with little novelty and frustrating UX; others enjoy a pop‑sci synthesis and ideas like “copying precedes replication.” Debates center on universal approximation vs causal world models, and whether disembodied AI can equal human intelligence.

- Comment pulse
    - Structure criticized as "yes‑set" persuasion sandwich and incoherent grab bag → flashy facts mask weak thesis — counterpoint: some enjoyed the eclectic pop‑sci tour.
    - Missing rigor → readers point to Hutter’s UAI and Friston/Clark predictive processing as stronger, formal foundations for defining and measuring intelligence.
    - Universal approximation ≠ intelligence → efficient causal world models and embodiment matter; LLMs chiefly interpolate within human‑generated knowledge; embodiment debate raised via locked‑in counterexample.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Ambitious synthesis linking evolution, cybernetics, and Transformers; stimulating but thesis is diffuse—better as map of ideas than settled account.
    - Impact: May nudge AI toward agents with explicit world models, self‑supervised grounding, and replication‑style objectives beyond passive prediction.
    - Watch next: Benchmarks for causal modeling and planning; embodied LLM‑robot hybrids; practical approximations of AIXI/UAI that trade optimality for tractable learning.
