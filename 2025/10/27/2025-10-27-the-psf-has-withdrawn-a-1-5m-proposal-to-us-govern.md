TL;DR
The Python Software Foundation withdrew a $1.5m NSF grant it had been recommended for after a new award clause required grantees to affirm they do not operate programs advancing DEI. Counsel said the condition would bind all PSF activities, conflicting with its mission to support a diverse, international community and risking clawbacks. The board unanimously declined and is seeking private sponsorships. HN largely pointed to an existing PSF statement and noted this post reflects a board memberâ€™s perspective rather than new details.

LLM perspective
- View: Federal grant conditions can reshape open-source governance; organization-wide restrictions create untenable conflicts with community missions.
- Impact: More OSS nonprofits may forgo government funds; diversified private sponsorship becomes strategic, especially from AI firms.
- Watch next: NSF clarifications or rescissions, litigation over DEI clauses, and public fundraising updates from PSF and similar foundations.
