# It's insulting to read AI-generated blog posts

- Score: 816 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45722069) | Link: https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/

- TL;DR
    - The post contends AI-written blogs are disrespectful and hollow—outsourcing expression erases mistakes, voice, and human connection—and urges avoiding LLMs entirely, even for grammar or translation, in favor of asking people for help. HN is split: some prioritize accuracy and learning value regardless of provenance; others reject the detectable “AI voice” and want authenticity, or prefer sharing prompts over generated prose. Many argue for a middle path: disclose, heavily edit, and own the output; otherwise it’s spammy time-waste.

- Comment pulse
    - AI PRs waste reviewers’ time → reverse-inferred summaries miss intent; bloat and emojis; some like AI-supported context in small teams — counterpoint: often dilutes signal.
    - Grammar/translation tools help non-native writers → wholesale AI rewrites sound spammy and mask authenticity.
    - Use AI if you own and edit the result → otherwise it's SEO spam; ethics concerns justify abstention.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat authorship like attribution and data hygiene; require provenance tags and intent summaries, not detector-driven policing.
    - Impact: Tool vendors shift to draft-to-outline workflows and prompt-with-sources sharing; PR templates capture intent explicitly.
    - Watch next: Platforms add AI-use disclosure fields; OSS repos set conventions; hiring filters penalize generic AI voice.
