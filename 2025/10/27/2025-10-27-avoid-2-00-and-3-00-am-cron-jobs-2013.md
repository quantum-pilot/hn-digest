# Avoid 2:00 and 3:00 am cron jobs (2013)

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723554) | Link: https://www.endpointdev.com/blog/2013/04/avoid-200-and-300-am-cron-jobs/

- TL;DR
  - Daylight saving transitions make 2–3 a.m. dangerous for cron: times can repeat or vanish, causing missed, duplicated, or thrashing runs. The post advises avoiding those hours, or using UTC, better schedulers, or—wishfully—ending DST. HN adds nuance: servers and logs should default to UTC, but many jobs must follow local-time semantics. Cron implementations differ; older vixie-cron can misfire at DST boundaries. Engineers recount real incidents, TZ database churn, and language differences around ambiguous/nonexistent times.

- Comment pulse
  - Use UTC by default → reduces DST bugs and diffing logs; tzdata and regional rules change unexpectedly. — counterpoint: billing/meetings need local-time schedules and stored timezones.
  - Cron varies by OS → Debian/OpenBSD handle skipped/overlapped hours; legacy vixie-cron may rerun jobs rapidly or miss them, matching the article’s 3:00 a.m. thrash.
  - Time math is hard → nonexistent and ambiguous instants (e.g., 02:30) and midnight shifts; languages differ (Ruby errors, Java silent), causing real outages.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prefer UTC servers and idempotent jobs with locks; schedule local-time tasks via TZ-aware libraries, not naive cron.
  - Impact: Fewer duplicate/missed runs, cleaner logs, safer billing windows; less pager noise during DST and tzdata updates.
  - Watch next: Audit cron for 2–3 a.m.; add flock/timeouts; monitor tzdata releases; test DST in staging; consider Quartz/Airflow/Systemd timers.
