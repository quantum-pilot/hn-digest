# Microsoft in court for allegedly misleading Australians over 365 subscriptions

- Score: 242 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45721682) | Link: https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/microsoft-in-court-for-allegedly-misleading-millions-of-australians-over-microsoft-365-subscriptions

- TL;DR
  - Australia’s ACCC sued Microsoft, alleging it misled ~2.7M Microsoft 365 Personal/Family subscribers by presenting Copilot integration and higher prices ($159 Personal, $179 Family) as mandatory unless cancelling, while hiding “Classic” plans that kept prior features and prices ($109, $139) deep in the cancellation flow. Two emails and a blog post omitted this option. HN reports similar experiences in the US: Classic plans only appear when cancelling or disabling auto-renew, occasional odd pricing, and a $20 OneDrive-only tier; frustration centers on dark patterns and low-perceived value of AI upsells.

- Comment pulse
  - Hidden downgrade path exists → Classic plans appear only after starting cancellation; turning off auto-renew sometimes triggers it; some found $20 OneDrive-only Basic.
  - AI upsell lacks value → Many skip Copilot; hikes feel artificial; some canceled — counterpoint: Family $99–$129 can be reasonable for 5 users.
  - Dark patterns normalized → Concealed options erode trust; critics blame shareholder primacy; similar tactics reported at Atlassian and Dropbox.

- LLM perspective
  - View: ACCC is testing “dark pattern” enforcement for AI bundling and forced upsells in subscriptions.
  - Impact: Global vendors may add explicit opt-outs, unbundle AI, and surface downgrade paths pre-cancellation.
  - Watch next: Court remedies, FTC/EU actions, mandated UI changes, refunds, and whether Microsoft discloses Classic or rethinks Copilot pricing.
