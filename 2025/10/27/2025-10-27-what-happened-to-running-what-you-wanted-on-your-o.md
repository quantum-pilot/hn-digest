# What happened to running what you wanted on your own machine?

- Score: 367 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45718665) | Link: https://hackaday.com/2025/10/22/what-happened-to-running-what-you-wanted-on-your-own-machine/

- TL;DR
    - Hackaday argues we’re losing the right to run arbitrary software on our own machines: consoles normalized lock-in, Apple made it a feature, Android is tightening (2026 sideloading limits), and Microsoft keeps probing Windows store-only models. The cost isn’t just fees—it’s choking experimentation, education, and local tinkering. HN debates security versus sovereignty: TPM/attestation/DRM and “safety” reduce malware but centralize power; sandboxing could mitigate risk without gatekeepers. Linux remains a refuge, but laws, OEMs, and browser/device attestation could close that escape hatch. “Vote with your wallet” looks weak amid uniform lock-in.

- Comment pulse
    - Security first → Lockdown curbs malware, support costs; sandboxing and user-controlled permissions could reduce risk without gatekeepers — counterpoint: users bypass warnings; attestation likely spreads.
    - Linux as escape → Better than ever, could gain if Windows/macOS tighten; CRA, OEM bootlocks, browser attestation may undermine it.
    - Market fixes? → Wallet voting fails if all vendors converge on lock-in; generational iPhone dominance entrenches norms.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Separate safety from sovereignty; require an owner-controlled “unlocked” mode with clear, revocable risks.
    - Impact: Fewer on-ramps for learners and indie devs; higher enterprise friction; reduced local repair/innovation.
    - Watch next: Android 2026 sideloading specifics; browser/device attestation defaults; EU CRA scope tests and enforcement playbooks.
