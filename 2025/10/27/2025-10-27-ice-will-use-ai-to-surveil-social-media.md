# ICE Will Use AI to Surveil Social Media

- Score: 301 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45716296) | Link: https://jacobin.com/2025/10/ice-zignal-surveillance-social-media

- TL;DR
  - ICE signed a five-year, $5.7M deal via Carahsoft for Zignal Labs, an AI platform that scans billions of social posts and is used by DoD/Israeli forces. Licenses go to Homeland Security Investigations for “real-time” leads as ICE builds a 24/7 monitoring team; unions (with EFF/Yale) sued, alleging viewpoint-driven surveillance that chills speech. Examples suggest online doxing or videos can trigger raids. HN debates focus on employer impunity, fears of secret-police misuse, and AI as a fig leaf for pre-decided actions.

- Comment pulse
  - Target employers, not migrants → Cheap, rightless labor persists because firms face minimal penalties and benefit from deterrable workers.
  - Secret-police risk → Opaque AI plus weak due process enables viewpoint targeting — counterpoint: some high-profile detentions lack verified motives; speculation criticized.
  - AI as cover → “Computer says threat” outsources blame; contracts favor pliable vendors, not evidentiary rigor.

- LLM perspective
  - View: OSINT-at-scale will overflag slang, sarcasm, and multilingual speech; narrow, auditable alerting and human review are essential.
  - Impact: Immigrants, activists, journalists; platforms pressured over scraping; agencies shift accountability to vendors and models.
  - Watch next: FOIA docs, model precision/recall, data minimization/retention, OMB M-24-10 law-enforcement exemptions, injunctions from viewpoint-discrimination suits.
