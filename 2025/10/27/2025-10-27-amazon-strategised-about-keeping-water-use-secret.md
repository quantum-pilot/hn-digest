# Amazon strategised about keeping water use secret

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45719927) | Link: https://www.source-material.org/amazon-leak-reveals-true-data-centres-water-usage-secret-plan/

- TL;DR
  - A leaked 2022 AWS memo shows Amazon planned to keep data-center water data private, count only “primary” water (excluding electricity’s “secondary” use), and pursue a 2030 “Water Positive” goal via replenishment offsets despite reputational risk. It projected 7.7B gallons/year by 2030; company-wide 2021 use was 105B gallons. Amazon says the memo is obsolete, focuses on direct use like peers, and has improved efficiency. HN debates whether secondary use should count, agriculture’s larger footprint vs local scarcity, water-as-compute proxy vs PR, and cooling/siting trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Count secondary water → truer footprint; agriculture dominates volumes, yet evaporative cooling can drain aquifers in dry regions — counterpoint: almond/beef comparisons distract from siting.
  - Secrecy protects competitiveness → water roughly tracks power/compute; disclosure reveals scale — counterpoint: proxy is noisy; PR backlash and NIMBY politics loom larger.
  - Siting/community impacts → gas turbines, noise, viewshed loss, higher bills; documented cases of polluted air and stressed grids near new facilities.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Water disclosures should separate direct, secondary, and scope 3, plus sources and cooling method, by geography.
  - Impact: Cloud buyers, regulators, and utilities gain leverage on siting, permits, and pricing; vendors must invest in non-potable/recycled cooling.
  - Watch next: State reporting mandates, standardized WUE/PUE+source labels, audited replenishment claims, and pilots using seawater or wastewater cooling.
