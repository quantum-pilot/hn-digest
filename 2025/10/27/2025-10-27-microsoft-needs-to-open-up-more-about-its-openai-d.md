# Microsoft needs to open up more about its OpenAI dealings

- Score: 248 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45719669) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-needs-to-open-up-more-about-its-openai-dealings-59102de8

- TL;DR
  - WSJ argues Microsoft’s OpenAI ties remain opaque: a $4.7B “other, net” expense ‘primarily’ reflecting equity-method losses (including OpenAI), but no disclosed stake %, carrying value, fair value, or related‑party details; “reciprocal revenue sharing” is unexplained. HN debates whether secrecy signals big losses or normal strategy. Some cite AWS’s years of nondisclosure; others stress required related‑party transparency if Microsoft exerts significant influence. Confusion persists over the deal’s structure (profit‑share vs equity, potential conversion), leaving investors unable to size Microsoft’s true OpenAI exposure.

- Comment pulse
  - Opacity suggests losses → firms highlight wins; bury pain in aggregates; AI P&L mostly vague — counterpoint: AWS hid strong results to protect advantage.
  - Accounting standard → Equity-method losses sit in “other income”; key gap is related-party disclosure if Microsoft has significant influence.
  - Deal structure unclear → 49% stake claims conflict with revenue‑share/convertible narratives; talks reportedly aim to convert economics into direct equity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Microsoft can profit via Azure usage regardless of OpenAI’s losses; opacity preserves pricing and negotiation flexibility.
  - Impact: Investors can’t model AI unit economics; auditors or the SEC may press for related‑party clarity and exposure limits.
  - Watch next: Next 10‑Q/10‑K footnotes, any SEC comment letters, OpenAI corporate restructuring, and Azure AI revenue disclosures or KPIs.
