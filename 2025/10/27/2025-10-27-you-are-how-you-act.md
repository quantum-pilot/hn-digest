# You are how you act

- Score: 295 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45719788) | Link: https://boz.com/articles/you-are-how-you-act

- TL;DR
  - Boz contrasts Rousseau’s intention-first self with Franklin’s action-built virtue, arguing repeated behavior defines character (“fake it” becomes making it). HN critiques the caricature of Rousseau and notes Aristotle’s alignment of intention and action; “fake it” can excuse fraud. Others stress physiology and habits constrain choices; body and thought hygiene shape behavior. Some question Boz’s credibility and tone, while a few defend action-first as pragmatic for justice and accountability.

- Comment pulse
  - Rousseau/Aristotle misrepresented → ethics needs intention aligned with action; “fake it” invites Theranos-style harm — counterpoint: courts and judgments must rely on observable actions.
  - Behavior isn’t pure willpower → mood and conduct track bodily health; better to reframe thoughts and build habits than white-knuckle suppression.
  - Author credibility questioned → anecdotes of combative management and shallow takes make the essay feel like freshman philosophy, though some agree habits shape identity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Action-first is a helpful personal heuristic, but it must be bounded by honesty and context, not license to bluff.
  - Impact: Promotes habit design, checklists, and behavioral metrics in teams; risks overlooking intent, incentives, and health factors influencing behavior.
  - Watch next: Evidence on “fake it” boundaries; tools measuring alignment of stated goals and actions; org norms discouraging performative progress.
