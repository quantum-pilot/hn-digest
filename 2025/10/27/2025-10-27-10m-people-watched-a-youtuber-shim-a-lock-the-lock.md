# 10M people watched a YouTuber shim a lock; the lock company sued him – bad idea

- Score: 736 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45720376) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/suing-a-popular-youtuber-who-shimmed-a-130-lock-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/

- TL;DR
  After a viral video showed YouTuber Trevor McNally opening a Proven Industries trailer-hitch lock in seconds with a soda-can shim, the company fired off DMCA takedowns and an eight-count lawsuit. A federal judge rejected a preliminary injunction, signaling fair use and skepticism toward “defamation by implication,” and the company dropped the case while oddly seeking to seal records. HN readers note the Streisand effect, praise lockpicking reviewers, and argue that public demos pressure manufacturers to fix weak designs faster than litigation.

- Comment pulse
  - Public lockpicking helps consumers and spurs fixes → LPL/Covert Instruments expose exaggerated claims — counterpoint: Tutorials aid thieves; detractors note criminals prefer brute force.
  - Company’s response backfired → DMCA and lawsuit triggered Streisand effect; better play was acknowledge issue, ship sturdier cores, and move on.
  - Legal take → Fair use protects short critical clips; ‘defamation by implication’ and tortious-interference claims falter without false statements or specific relationships.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This sets a pragmatic norm: engage testers, fix designs, don’t litigate truthfully demonstrated vulnerabilities.
  - Impact: Lock makers, YouTubers, and platforms recalibrate: fewer takedowns, more collaboration, clearer policies on criticism and harassment boundaries.
  - Watch next: Look for product redesigns, security-core upgrades, clear disclosure programs, and appellate rulings refining fair use for reaction/short-form content.
