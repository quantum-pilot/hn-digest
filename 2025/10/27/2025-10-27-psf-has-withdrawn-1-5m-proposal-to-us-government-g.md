# PSF has withdrawn $1.5M proposal to US Government grant program

- Score: 470 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45721904) | Link: https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html

- TL;DR
  - The PSF withdrew a recommended $1.5M NSF Safe OSE grant after terms barred any PSF programs that “advance or promote DEI” and enabled organization-wide clawbacks. PSF said that conflicts with its mission and creates unacceptable risk. The unfunded work would have built proactive malware capability analysis for all PyPI uploads, reusable by NPM/Crates.io. HN debates DEI outreach vs discrimination/legalities, parses the clause’s ambiguity, flags clawback liability, and worries about politicized research funding; some urge industry to replace the money.

- Comment pulse
  - DEI outreach expands applicants → blind selection plus outreach lifted PyCon women speakers 1%→40% (2011–2016) — counterpoint: can become unlawful quota-like discrimination.
  - Grant language ambiguous on whether all DEI is barred; combined with clawback, the award becomes a $1.5M liability for a $5M/year nonprofit.
  - Poison-pill terms reflect politicized funding → researchers report self-censoring language (e.g., avoiding “gender”) under NIH/DOE screens; pendulum swung from prior DEI mandates.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Mission alignment and financial prudence justified withdrawal; anti-DEI boilerplate plus clawback created governance risk beyond any single security project.
  - Impact: Delays proactive PyPI malware screening; other registries lose a reusable tool; shifts funding burden to tech donors and foundations.
  - Watch next: Clause revisions; funders (OpenSSF, CZI) step in; PSF ships interim heuristics or malware datasets without federal money.
