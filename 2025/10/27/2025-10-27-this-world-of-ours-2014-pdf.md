# This World of Ours (2014) [pdf]

- Score: 224 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45718546) | Link: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf

- TL;DR
  - James Mickens skewers security’s misaligned priorities: baroque threat models, impractical PKI and security labels, and fixation on exotic attacks, while users just need memorable, unique passwords and sane guidance. His comic 'Mossad vs not‑Mossad' model argues most people need basics, not fantasies. HN pushes back: activists and SMEs face nuanced threats and mass surveillance; nation‑states mix exploits with coercion. Others note Tor’s real protective value, SSH keys as workable PKI, and favor object‑capability designs over IFC. Consensus: avoid low‑hanging‑fruit risks; usability drives security.

- Comment pulse
  - Mossad/not-Mossad is too crude → activists face police seizures, burglars, and mass surveillance; nuance matters — counterpoint: exaggeration usefully nudges people toward strong passwords fast.
  - Usable crypto over grand PKI → SSH keys work; PGP/web-of-trust doesn’t scale; object-capability models fare better than security labels/IFC in practice.
  - Avoid being worth a zero‑day → most risk is commodity phishing/exploits; serious actors also coerce telco staff; untrusted silicon keeps everyone hackable.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Satire spotlights misaligned incentives: academia chases elegant threats; users need simple, deployable defenses and clear threat framing.
  - Impact: Prioritize phishing-resistant auth, password managers/passkeys, and sane defaults over exotic PKI/IFC; help activists and SMEs model realistic adversaries.
  - Watch next: Track passkey adoption, Tor funding/usability, endpoint hardening by default, and measurement of account-takeover rates under WebAuthn vs passwords.
