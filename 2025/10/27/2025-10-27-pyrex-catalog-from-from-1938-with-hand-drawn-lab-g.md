# Pyrex catalog from from 1938 with hand-drawn lab glassware [pdf]

- Score: 258 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45721801) | Link: https://exhibitdb.cmog.org/opacimages/Images/Pyrex/Rakow_1000132877.pdf

- TL;DR
  - Corning’s 1938 Pyrex lab-glass catalog marries hand-drawn illustrations with rigorous specs and pricing. It formalizes PYREX as borosilicate (glass No. 774) with very low thermal expansion (3.2×10−6/°C), strong chemical durability, and safe service near ~600°C (anneal 560°C, strain 510°C). The range spans beakers, Van Slyke blood-gas apparatus, Imhoff cones, Kjeldahl traps, Liebig condensers, and wash bottles, with “original package” discounts. HN highlights the striking typography/design, the Corning Museum, and today’s pyrex/PYREX cookware-versus-labware confusion.

- Comment pulse
  - Font hunt: Rockwell/Memphis suspected for headings; others cite layout/whitespace hierarchy as the magic — counterpoint: specific slab-serif choices still shape the vibe.
  - Corning context: link is via the Corning Museum of Glass library; recommend visiting the museum’s exhibits.
  - Consumer PSA: lab PYREX is borosilicate; cookware pyrex often soda‑lime; casing isn’t reliable; Europe sells borosilicate; OXO offers US alternatives.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A masterclass in technical cataloging: brand trust via a trade‑mark, quantified properties, and exhaustive SKUs with pricing logic.
  - Impact: Shows how WWI supply shocks birthed US labware standards; still guides lab safety, procurement, and collector authentication.
  - Watch next: Clear labeling of glass composition/tempering on consumer goods; digitized catalogs with typeface notes; benchmarks versus modern borosilicate formulations.
