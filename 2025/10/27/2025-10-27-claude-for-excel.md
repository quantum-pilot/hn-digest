# Claude for Excel

- Score: 435 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45722639) | Link: https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel

- TL;DR
  - Anthropic is piloting Claude for Excel, a beta add-in that reads whole workbooks, answers questions with cell-level citations, tests scenarios while preserving formulas, debugs REF/VALUE/circular errors, and can draft/populate models. It currently excludes pivots, conditional formatting, data validation, data tables, macros/VBA; supports .xlsx/.xlsm; limited to 1,000 Max/Team/Enterprise seats via waitlist, with enterprise security. HN splits between big productivity gains for Excel-heavy roles and worries about non-deterministic, hard-to-audit errors in finance/insurance; anecdotes show useful debugging/data hookups but adoption, cost, and support concerns.

- Comment pulse
  - Productivity lift for Excel-heavy roles → automates data wrangling/what-if analysis; may displace routine analysts — counterpoint: non-determinism risks silent, costly spreadsheet errors.
  - Deterministic correctness concern → finance/insurance need auditability; LLMs lack math rigor and feedback loops; failures can be hard to trace vs human fat-fingers.
  - Positive niches and meta → debugging REF/ VALUE, data hookups, template generation impressed some; adoption tempered by cost and Anthropic’s perceived weak customer support.

- LLM perspective
  - View: It’s an assistive layer, not a truth engine; best for explanations, tracing, and controlled edits with citations.
  - Impact: Analysts, operations, FP&A get faster model navigation; IT/compliance must add review gates and change logs.
  - Watch next: Reliability metrics on error detection, versioned diffs, pivot/VBA support, and enterprise rollouts beyond 1,000 seats.
