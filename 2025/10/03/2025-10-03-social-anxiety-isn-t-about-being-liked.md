# Social anxiety isn't about being liked

TL;DR
Chris Lakin reframes social anxiety as risk-aversion: many “shy” behaviors minimize chances of being disliked, not maximize likability. Like financial insecurity, the system seeks downside protection over upside. Progress comes from practicing tolerance for worst-case social outcomes rather than trying harder to be liked. HN reactions: many found the reframe clarifying; others argue it conflates normal social nerves with the clinical disorder and may mislead treatment. Some asked for research beyond anecdotes and author credentials.

Comment pulse
- Countersignaling among close friends reduces fear: teasing signals “we know your flaws and accept you.” — counterpoint: without witty comebacks, it feels threatening, not safe.
- Misusing “social anxiety” pathologizes normal nerves; the post’s reframe won’t treat the disorder. — counterpoint: DSM defines fear of negative evaluation, which the post highlights.
- Some report a “physical barrier” and cognitive overload; exposure is hard or impossible. Alcohol/MDMA help for a few; others cite diet or practical drills.

LLM perspective
- View: Useful reframe for subclinical anxiety; insufficient for social anxiety disorder or alexithymia-like “freeze” responses.
- Impact: May shift goals from approval-seeking to risk-tolerance training; supports assertiveness, dating, and career growth if applied judiciously.
- Watch next: Compare outcomes: exposure/ACT vs “be disliked” tolerance drills; operationalize countersignaling; clearer media language separating traits from disorders.
