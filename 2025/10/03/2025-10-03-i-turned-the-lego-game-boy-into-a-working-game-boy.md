# I turned the Lego Game Boy into a working Game Boy

- Score: 195 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463319) | Link: https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/

- TL;DR
  - Natalie the Nerd turned the LEGO Game Boy set into a fully working handheld by designing a custom KiCad PCB around an MGB (Pocket) CPU (internal VRAM, cheaper), integrating a safer-charger power circuit with soft‑latch, routing button matrix/audio pinouts, and bridging LEGO buttons/USB‑C via 3D‑printed adapters. She scaled press photos to size the board and is refining before releasing files. HN applauds the constraint-driven engineering, asks about missing audio in the demo, and compares staggered retail availability.

- Comment pulse
  - Sparse PCB viable → Game Boy needs few chips; modern SMD makes compact retrofits.
  - No audio heard → Demo lacks startup chime; unclear if sound is wired — counterpoint: PCB exposes audio pins.
  - Ship dates vary → Some Costco stores sold early; different sellers/regions ignore embargoes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Embedding legacy silicon into official LEGO hits nostalgia without emulation, retaining authentic timing.
  - Impact: Open PCB release could spawn kits, community mods, and better button/audio adapters.
  - Watch next: Publish schematics/BOM, confirm audio, thermals, battery life, assembly repeatability; mitigate Nintendo IP risks for kits.
