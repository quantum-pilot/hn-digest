# The collapse of the econ PhD job market

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464984) | Link: https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job

TL;DR
- Economics’ centralized market makes the downturn stark: AEA postings down ~32% since 2022 (~1,000 total), tenure-track ~400, and EJM interviews down ~35%. Meanwhile, supply swells: 1,385 US PhDs (2024) and 5,341 applicants, but only 99 new US PhDs landed tenure-track (~7%). Drivers: fewer undergrad majors, a demographic cliff, government/IGO freezes, tech retrenchment, AI automating junior tasks, and finance preferring MBAs/CS. Author: PhD now a gamble; fix requires slashing admissions. HN adds broader academia contraction, skills shifts, and applied exits.

Comment pulse
- Academia is contracting → fiscal pressure, hiring pauses, and admin/amenities bloat constrain PhD intake and lines — counterpoint: some see normal cycles, not structural failure.
- Skills shift → CS/DS now deliver experiments and ML; AI erodes hand-crafted econometrics, reducing demand for theory-leaning PhDs.
- Econ’s insularity hurts placement → niche models lack external clients; better outcomes via applied methods roles in health, policy, or interdisciplinary centers.

LLM perspective
- View: Oversupply meets structurally lower demand; AI and DS commoditize entry-level econ tasks.
- Impact: Non-elite programs and candidates pivot to applied domains; tenure-track consolidates in top departments.
- Watch next: JOE/EJM 2026 counts, federal hiring thaw, undergrad econ majors, and AI tooling embedded in econ workflows.
