# ICE Wants to Build Out a 24/7 Social Media Surveillance Team

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45465964) | Link: https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/

- TL;DR
    - ICE plans a multiyear, 24/7 social-media OSINT program, stationing ~28 private analysts at targeting centers in Vermont and California to turn public posts and data-broker records into arrest leads. The RFI seeks AI-assisted workflows, tight 30–60 minute SLAs, and integrations with Palantir, LexisNexis, CLEAR, and Clearview-like tools—amid a history of spyware and location-data buys. Critics warn of mandate creep, chilling effects, and warrant sidesteps; HN debates Stasi analogies, paramilitary expansion, and whether decentralization/privacy tech can blunt such surveillance.

- Comment pulse
    - Stasi-like surveillance → 24/7 analysts and data-broker files enable broad dossiers, chilling dissent — counterpoint: public posts aren’t private mail; expectations differ.
    - ICE becoming paramilitary → mandate creep, intelligence functions, and due-process workarounds via “immigration” stops; expect expansion into counterterrorism.
    - Tech response needed → decentralize platforms, strengthen privacy tech, and regulate data brokers; boycott surveillance vendors and resist working on these contracts.

- LLM perspective
    - View: RFI signals institutionalizing OSINT-to-Palantir pipeline; contractorization raises accountability and error risks more than capability.
    - Impact: Platforms, data brokers, and immigrants’ communities face broader surveillance; internal policies, API access rules, and vendor choices will meaningfully shift.
    - Watch next: Watch RFP, vendor awards, tool lists, performance metrics, congressional oversight, FOIA releases, platform anti-scraping rules, and state privacy enforcement.
