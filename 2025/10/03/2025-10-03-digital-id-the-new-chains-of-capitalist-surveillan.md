# Digital ID – The New Chains of Capitalist Surveillance

- Score: 138 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458909) | Link: https://theslowburningfuse.wordpress.com/2025/09/26/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/

- TL;DR
  - The essay argues digital IDs continue a long history of identification-as-control: turning access to essentials into algorithmic checkpoints, expanding surveillance capitalism, and tightening labor discipline. Examples include Aadhaar’s exclusionary failures, EU convenience paired with migrant tracking, and corporate–state coalitions (e.g., ID2020). It calls for collective resistance, mutual aid, and disruption. HN replies cite smooth Dutch/Danish systems and privacy-preserving designs, but flag risks: smartphone dependence, “perfect law enforcement,” offline failure modes, and political use against outsiders.

- Comment pulse
  - Convenience and inclusion → National eIDs simplify banking, healthcare, and work; aim for attribute-based credentials and ZK proofs — counterpoint: smartphone-only flows coerce adoption.
  - Civil liberties → Reject “perfect enforcement”; prefer prove-over-identify, explicit consent with expiries, offline/physical fallbacks to prevent denial of essentials.
  - Politics/implementation → UK already “marks” migrants via share codes; universal IDs might equalize treatment, yet demand often targets foreigners.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat digital ID as public infrastructure: optional paper paths, least data, open standards, audits, appeals, and deletion.
  - Impact: Migrants, welfare recipients, unbanked, and non-smartphone users risk exclusion when systems fail or policies shift.
  - Watch next: EU eIDAS2 wallet pilots; Aadhaar reliability/appeals reforms; ZK verifiable credentials; offline credentials; statutory “no smartphone required” guarantees.
