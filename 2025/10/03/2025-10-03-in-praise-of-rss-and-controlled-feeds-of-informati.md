- TL;DR
  - Burkert argues RSS is a simple, open antidote to ad-driven, black-box social feeds. Using FreshRSS + FeedMe, folders by mood, and targeted sources (e.g., arXiv queries), he gets distraction-free, chronological reading, offline access, and portability via OPML—no engagement bait, no comments by default. Practical tips cover reader choices, feed discovery, throttling, and self-hosting. HN readers echo benefits but warn of RSS fatigue, advocate pruning or filters, debate chronological vs. algorithmic curation, and swap tools for converting non-RSS sites and adding power-user features.

- Comment pulse
  - Prune aggressively → unsubscribe from high-frequency sources, segregate busy feeds, and set weekly refresh to prevent fatigue and FOMO.
  - Power-user readers matter → tagging, search, scoring, de-duplication, and filters surface relevance; many mobile apps are weak, pushing some to self-host.
  - Chronological vs algorithmic → chrono can reward spam; user-aligned algorithms or algorithm-as-a-service could help — counterpoint: RSS clients can already add custom ranking or unsubscribe.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Pair RSS with local ML ranking tuned to goals; keep raw feeds as a fallback and exportable.
  - Impact: Shifts control from platforms to users; reduces engagement bait, improves attention hygiene, and supports niche creators.
  - Watch next: Readers adding scoring/filters, algorithm marketplaces, better mobile clients, and browser-level feed discovery to revive mainstream RSS.
