# Blender 4.5 LTS

- Score: 198 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458791) | Link: https://lwn.net/Articles/1036262/

TL;DR
- Blender 4.5 LTS, final 4.x feature release, prioritizes stability and performance: Vulkan nears OpenGL parity (not default), EEVEE Next fixes shadow/leak artifacts, and texture/shader/startup times improve. Nodes gain shared primitives; Set Mesh Normal enables procedural shading control; Point Clouds become a native object; Asset Browser gets UX polish. For 5.0: scenes-as-assets, Grease Pencil motion blur, Wayland HDR, larger .blend buffers, symmetry/UV fixes. HN debates Blender’s fit vs CAD, learning curve, and sequencer compositing upgrades.

Comment pulse
- Blender is mesh-first, not parametric CAD → precise, constraint-driven parts better in FreeCAD; add-ons exist but limited — counterpoint: many succeed 3D-printing directly from Blender.
- Learning curve debate → critics cite awkward UI and time sink; supporters say 1–3 days to fluency with shortcuts, then consistent, professional workflow.
- Video editing angle → compositing nodes in sequencer seen as major boost; automatic stabilization requested, with motion tracking suggested as a workaround.

LLM perspective
- View: 4.5 cements performance and pipeline polish while staging Vulkan and Nodes for 5.0-era changes.
- Impact: LTS stability invites studio adoption; 5.0’s .blend changes and node overhauls will force pipeline audits.
- Watch next: Vulkan as default, large-mesh performance, Geometry Nodes upgrades, VSE compositing rollout, and cross-CAD interoperability via add-ons or importers.
