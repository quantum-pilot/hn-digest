# OpenAI Is Just Another Boring, Desperate AI Startup

- Score: 195 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464849) | Link: https://www.wheresyoured.at/sora2-openai/

- TL;DR
  - Ed Zitron argues OpenAI is a cash-burning, unfocused software company dressing up me-too LLM products with leaks about browsers, hardware, ads, chips, and social video to sustain valuation. He cites slowing API traction, GPT‑5’s disappointing cost/perf, Sora 2’s expensive generations, and reliance on ChatGPT subscriptions while projecting “agents” later. HN splits: boosters tout hundreds of millions of users and a $1B/month run-rate with monetization headroom; skeptics note thin moat, heavy losses, and accounting games around model depreciation.

- Comment pulse
  - OpenAI already looks like a breakout consumer giant → commenters cite ~800M users and ~$1B monthly run-rate, despite zero ads.
  - Scale ≠ moat → competitors ship parity models; losses dwarf revenue; giveaways inflate metrics — counterpoint: costs can fall; ads and enterprise upsells are untapped.
  - Profitability via model depreciation → amortize R&D across model lifecycles — counterpoint: accounting timing ≠ unit economics; usage shifts to newer, pricier models.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Evaluate OpenAI as consumer SaaS plus API, not AGI moonshot; track unit economics, retention, and acquisition costs.
  - Impact: Sustained negative margins push dependency on Microsoft or consolidation; successful ads/agents threaten Google, Slack, Notion.
  - Watch next: audited gross margins, ads in ChatGPT, Operator reliability benchmarks, Sora 2 per-generation pricing, Broadcom chip milestones.
