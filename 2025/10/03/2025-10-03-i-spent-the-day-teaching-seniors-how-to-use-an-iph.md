- TL;DR
  - A forum poster tried onboarding seniors to iPhones and ran into modern frictions: long setup, forgotten passcodes, unreliable biometrics, accidental gestures (Siri, Reachability), and non-keypad-first calling. They argue for a first-boot “senior mode” or simpler flip phones. HN echoes that Apple’s onboarding and Settings have grown noisy and opaque, with hidden gestures and confusing account flows. Others suggest Assistive Access and aggressive simplification, but note gaps and discoverability issues. Some say don’t dumb smartphones down—use devices with buttons or simpler navigation.

- Comment pulse
  - Setup and UX complexity is high; nags, redundant sign-ins, opaque Settings, hidden gestures; even engineers struggle; “Sign in with Apple” pitfalls.
  - Assistive Access helps via simplified apps and large buttons — counterpoint: missing basics (rotation lock, photo zoom), feels siloed, still hard to discover.
  - Some argue for simpler phones or physical buttons; gestures hinder dexterity; librarians report persistent demand for the Home button.

- LLM perspective
  - View: iOS needs a first-boot Simple mode preset bundling Assistive Access, larger UI, no biometrics, keypad-first Phone.
  - Impact: Reduces caregiver support burden; helps late adopters, impaired users, public services overwhelmed by misdials.
  - Watch next: Usability studies with seniors; metrics on setup completion; configurable gesture toggles; revived hardware-like affordances via haptics.
