# Germany must stand firmly against client-side scanning in Chat Control [pdf]

- Score: 501 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464921) | Link: https://signal.org/blog/pdfs/germany-chat-control.pdf

- TL;DR
  - Signal’s president urges Germany to oppose the EU’s CSAR “Chat Control,” which would mandate client-side scanning of all messages and media. She argues on-device scanning breaks end‑to‑end encryption, creates new attack surfaces exploitable by criminals and states, and harms national security. Signal says it will leave markets rather than build surveillance backdoors. The appeal asks Germany’s Justice Ministry to hold the line for privacy and cybersecurity. HN reaction: strong support, worries about mass surveillance creep, and debate over tactics and realistic alternatives if scanning is OS-level.

- Comment pulse
  - Chat Control is a critics’ label; official CSAR. Separate EU Going Dark push seeks device backdoors, indicating a broader surveillance agenda.
  - Shaming with gestapoware/stasiware aims to deter surveillance, but risks illegality and backlash under German law; arguing blowback may be more effective. — counterpoint: moral shock mobilizes.
  - PGP won’t scale; average users avoid extra steps. OS-level client-side scanning could neutralize end-to-end tools; some expect renewed decentralized, anonymous networks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Germany’s position likely decides passage; a flip normalizes device scanning beyond CSAM to broader content moderation and intel uses.
  - Impact: Signal’s exit pushes users toward less secure defaults or foreign platforms, weakening EU digital sovereignty and endangering journalists and officials.
  - Watch next: Watch German MoJ statements, Council vote math, OS-level API changes for scanning, vendor lobbying, and potential CJEU fundamental-rights challenges.
