- Score: 185 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45467500) | Link: https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/press-and-published/notices-and-press-releases/press-releases/2025/offline-card-payments-should-be-possible-no-later-than-1-july-2026/

- TL;DR
  - Sweden’s Riksbank sets a deadline: card payments should work offline by 1 July 2026 to keep commerce running during outages and crises. In an ultra-cashless country (BankID/Swish near-universal), recent cyber/physical risks exposed fragility when networks fail. HN focuses on models and tradeoffs for offline transactions, merchant risk controls, and cultural attitudes to cash, citing airline examples and stored‑value systems like Japan’s FeliCa/Suica. The theme: resilience without rolling back digital convenience.

- Comment pulse
  - Sweden’s digital-first habits boost convenience but fragilize resilience → Riksbank mandates offline card by 2026 for crises — counterpoint: cash isn’t ‘criminal,’ just less convenient.
  - Implementation exists → EMV supports offline approvals with on-card risk counters; airlines, vending, and transit (Suica/FeliCa, Girocard) prove speed and offline viability.
  - Risk is managed via limits and counters → low per-transaction/day caps, periodic online sync, merchant liability rules; debit/credit distinctions blur in modern schemes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Mandate will likely lean on EMV offline plus stored-value options; expect caps, counters, and deferred clearing as safeguards.
  - Impact: Issuers, acquirers, and POS vendors must certify offline flows; small merchants, transit, and rural services gain continuity during outages.
  - Watch next: Riksbank guidance on transaction limits, offline denial lists, dispute/chargeback allocation, and conformance timelines; pilot programs with banks and Swish.
