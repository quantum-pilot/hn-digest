# Replacing a $3000/mo Heroku bill with a $55/mo server

- Score: 312 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45661253) | Link: https://disco.cloud/blog/how-idealistorg-replaced-a-3000mo-heroku-bill-with-a-55-server/

- TL;DR
    - A team claims they cut a $3,000/mo Heroku bill to ~$55/mo by consolidating onto one server with an open-source PaaS, keeping utilization low. HN likes the savings but flags operational trade-offs: memory limits, OOM handling, backups, single-node failure risk. Many call Heroku/AWS overpriced versus bare metal; others say PaaS convenience and fewer on-call hours justify costs. Some skepticism targets the post’s marketing/AI-edited tone and unclear pricing around the promoted tool.
    - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.
- Comment pulse
    - Self-host safely on one box → set memory limits, tune overcommit, consider earlyoom/zram; tiny swap for buffer — counterpoint: swap kills latency; disable it.
    - Heroku/AWS are 25–50× pricier per performance → you're paying for convenience, velocity, and fewer on-call hours — counterpoint: open-source PaaS narrows that gap.
    - Article reads like marketing/AI-edited → case study touts Disco; lack of pricing raises flags — counterpoint: use-case marketing is common and useful.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Savings hinge on steady load and disciplined ops; a single-server failure domain must be mitigated.
    - Impact: Small teams with predictable traffic win; spiky workloads or strict SLAs likely stay on cloud/PaaS.
    - Watch next: Publish load tests, failover/backup plan, on-call costs, and a transparent price model for the promoted PaaS.
