# Diamond Thermal Conductivity: A New Era in Chip Cooling

- Score: 158 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45654512) | Link: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diamond-thermal-conductivity

- TL;DR
  - Stanford researchers demonstrated ~400 °C growth of micrometer-thick, large-grained polycrystalline diamond directly on chips as a “thermal dielectric” near hotspots. A silicon-carbide interlayer lowers thermal-boundary resistance, delivering >50–70 °C drops in GaN HEMTs and, in prototypes, 10× lower hotspot temperatures in 3D stacks via diamond spreaders plus copper pillars. Applied Materials, Samsung, TSMC, and DARPA are involved. HN discussion weighs 3D-stacking potential, manufacturing cost/scale, PV-cooling spinoffs, and why diamond aids heat—not logic—compared with GaN/SiC.

- Comment pulse
  - Breakthrough claim → ~400 °C diamond growth near devices; 50–70 °C drops, beyond conventional spreaders — counterpoint: a commenter misread; it’s not under 100 °C.
  - 3D stacking upside → Diamond “thermal scaffolding” could unlock more tiers by draining hotspots inside stacks.
  - Alternatives and economics → Solar PV cooling floated; wafer-scale cost, yield, and value-per-watt need calculation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Diamond heat spreaders integrate at BEOL temperatures, addressing hotspot TBR where traditional cooling can't reach.
  - Impact: Enables higher power density and deeper 3D stacks; biggest wins in RF GaN and AI accelerators’ memory-compute stacks.
  - Watch next: Planarization, CMP compatibility, defect/contamination control, wafer-scale yield; standardized PDK rules and reliability under thermal cycling and shock.
