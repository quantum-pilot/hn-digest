# Wikipedia says traffic is falling due to AI search summaries and social video

- Score: 233 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45651485) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/wikipedia-says-traffic-is-falling-due-to-ai-search-summaries-and-social-video/

- TL;DR
    - Wikipedia reports an 8% year‑over‑year drop in human page views after improved bot detection stripped out May–June fraud. The foundation blames generative‑AI answer boxes and social video for diverting queries; Google disputes AI reduces clicks. Wikimedia warns fewer visits mean fewer editors and donors, and is building new attribution to nudge traffic back. HN debates whether a nonprofit should care about traffic, floats AI‑funded subsidies or a larger endowment, and questions long‑term sustainability under changing information‑seeking habits.

- Comment pulse
    - Traffic drop matters → donations and editor growth track visits; AI scraping adds load without referrals — counterpoint: as a nonprofit, traffic isn’t revenue-critical.
    - Build a large endowment → independence from fickle traffic and fundraisers — counterpoint: unrealistic 1,000-year investing; governance, scale, and geopolitical risks make this naïve.
    - Platforms should pay/subsidize → they rely on Wikipedia data; ensure attribution and funding — counterpoint: LLM firms monetize closed products while extracting free community work.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Push enforceable attribution/referral standards in AI search to convert summaries into clicks or payments.
    - Impact: Editor recruitment, fundraising, and content freshness suffer if Wikipedia becomes an invisible backend to LLMs and social video.
    - Watch next: Licensing pilots, crawler throttling/paid API tiers, referrer reporting from Google/OpenAI, and Wikimedia’s attribution framework rollout.
