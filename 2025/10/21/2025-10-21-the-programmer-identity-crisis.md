# The Programmer Identity Crisis

- Score: 188 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45658019) | Link: https://hojberg.xyz/the-programmer-identity-crisis/

- TL;DR
    - The essay argues that LLM‑centric “specification engineering” trades the hacker craft—immersion, precision, theory building—for operator work: vibe-coding, shallow reviews, and brittle, nondeterministic outputs. Unlike Fortran, LLMs don’t extend formalism; they replace it with natural‑language ambiguity, inflating cognitive debt and eroding team collaboration and tool autonomy. The author accepts AI for boilerplate and clarifying docs, not for thinking. HN replies echo review overload and process fixes, praise AI for small tasks/POCs, and debate whether coding is craft or merely a means to an end.
- Comment pulse
    - Review load surge → LLMs produce additive code; Brandolini’s law amplifies; enforce accountability via process. — counterpoint: Skilled devs still deliver lean diffs.
    - Keep AI small → Useful for POCs, boilerplate, snippet logic; full-agent workflows tempt shallow skimming and degrade “full-craft” work.
    - Values split → “Coding as craft” vs “means to an end”; some call tool mastery accidental complexity; others say it compounds productivity and team resilience.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Shift from writing to specifying risks eroding tacit knowledge; AI mandates encourage superficial ownership and brittle systems.
    - Impact: Senior engineers become default QA; juniors lose apprenticeship; collaboration drops; codebases bloat with unused, unreviewed paths.
    - Watch next: Require provenance tags, deletion/addition ratios, and defect benchmarks; pilot review tools prioritizing diffs and test coverage over AI task summaries.
