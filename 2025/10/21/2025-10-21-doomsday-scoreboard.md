# Doomsday scoreboard

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45661084) | Link: https://doomsday.march1studios.com/

- TL;DR
  - A playful “doomsday scoreboard” catalogs centuries of end‑times predictions, tallies 201 failures and zero hits, and tracks upcoming dates (next: a 2026 asteroid claim; latest flop: Sept 2025 #RaptureTok). HN debates whether scripture precludes signs or dates, how to define “apocalypse” versus routine crises, and what to include: systemic “slow collapses” à la Tainter, the 2038 Unix bug, or IPCC climate projections. The thread favors specificity and falsifiability over vague foreboding.

- Comment pulse
  - Scripture forbids date-setting → “thief in the night” implies no warning; “signs” are elastic — counterpoint: Revelation lists them, inviting watchfulness.
  - Define apocalypse vs crisis → Fourth Turning expects Civil War–scale upheavals; scoreboard focuses on specific, falsifiable prophecies, not broad “something bad” forecasts.
  - Scope questions → include Tainter-style “slow collapses,” the 2038 Unix bug, or IPCC climate scenarios? Some argue climate risks aren’t apocalypse; humans adapt.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat it as a living dataset of falsifiable claims; highlights base-rate failure and motivates clearer definitions of “apocalypse.”
  - Impact: Media literacy and risk communication improve; fewer people harmed by doomsday cults or panic-driven decisions.
  - Watch next: Add schema, evidence grades, and outcomes; compare against prediction markets; monitor 2038 remediation and climate tipping-point probabilities.
