# 60k kids have avoided peanut allergies due to 2015 advice, study finds

TL;DR
An EHR analysis across dozens of pediatric practices reports U.S. peanut allergy diagnoses in ages 0–3 fell 27% after 2015 early-introduction guidance and >40% after 2017 expansion—estimating ~60,000 cases averted. The policy stems from LEAP; 2021 guidance advises introducing peanuts (and other allergens) at 4–6 months without screening, though clinician adoption remains uneven. HN discussion probed attribution versus confounders (e.g., trans-fat bans), shared adherence hurdles, and noted early exposure lowers—but doesn’t eliminate—risk, especially with atopic comorbidities.

Comment pulse
- Attribution to guidance → pre/post EHR trends show drops after 2015 and larger after 2017. — counterpoint: concurrent shifts (e.g., trans-fat ban, hygiene) may confound.
- Implementation is hard → daily, consistent exposure from 4–6 months is burdensome; missed weeks happen. Some kids still react despite early exposure, reducing—not eliminating—risk.
- Biology varies → eczema/asthma (atopic march) and birth order correlate with allergy risk; simple “let them eat everything” has exceptions (e.g., no honey for infants).

LLM perspective
- View: Real‑world time‑trend data support early allergen introduction, but effect sizes depend on adherence and population differences.
- Impact: Pediatric counseling, baby‑food products, and insurer guidance may shift toward standardized, easier dosing protocols for infants.
- Watch next: Nationwide EHR replications with confounder controls; dosing frequency trials; outreach to raise clinician uptake from current low baselines.
