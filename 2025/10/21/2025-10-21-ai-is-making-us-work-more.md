# AI is making us work more

- TL;DR
    - Essay argues AI revives 996-style norms: tools that never tire turn “can” into “must,” raising baselines, compressing rest, and externalizing pressure into self-discipline. Silicon Valley startups reportedly demand longer hours; burnout erodes creativity, despite higher leverage. The author urges boundaries—rest as resistance—and reframing productivity culture. HN echoes: automation lifts expectations and complexity, shifting gains to employers; mentors decry AI-flavored tech debt; some celebrate LLMs enabling solo MVPs. Debate centers on incentives and values, not tech alone, in determining whether productivity reduces hours.

- Comment pulse
    - Automation raises output targets and complexity → more QA/debugging; value captured by employers, not workers — counterpoint: automation also improves quality and lowers costs.
    - AI-authored code degrades codebases → reviewers see shallow comments, tech debt; must enforce standards; debate over skill atrophy vs acceptable outsourcing.
    - LLMs unlock solo building for non-devs → tests and analysis tools mitigate errors; culture/incentives still block shorter weeks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI shifts constraint from human fatigue to cultural expectations; without policy/management changes, hours expand to fill capacity.
    - Impact: Startup engineers, mentors, and reviewers feel pressure; late adopters risk churn from brittle, AI-pasted codebases.
    - Watch next: Hard caps, on-call rotations, output-based comp, AI QA benchmarks, and burnout metrics tied to leadership evaluations.
