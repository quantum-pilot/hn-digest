# StarGrid: A new Palm OS strategy game

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45654660) | Link: https://quarters.captaintouch.com/blog/posts/2025-10-21-stargrid-has-arrived,-a-brand-new-palm-os-strategy-game-in-2025.html

TL;DR
- StarGrid is a new open-source, hex‑grid, turn‑based strategy game built from scratch for Palm OS, wrangling 1990s limits like tiny RAM and segmented code. It’s playable in-browser via CloudPilot and on hardware, with CPU-vs-CPU and multi-device playtests. HN’s response blends nostalgia and momentum: rePalm brings Palm OS to modern gadgets (even a Fisher‑Price Pixter), the Warfare Incorporated dev recalls extreme perf/size tricks, and commenters celebrate IR/pass‑and‑play, asynchronous design, and the distraction‑free Palm experience.

Comment pulse
- Palm OS revival plausible now → rePalm runs on modern/odd devices; CloudPilot enables web play — counterpoint: still niche, hardware scarcity limits reach.
- Classic Palm dev was brutal → Warfare Incorporated team cites heavy optimization and tiny binaries; community patches kept it usable across odd resolutions.
- Offline multiplayer still shines → IR and pass‑and‑play enabled low‑friction, asynchronous sessions many miss today; niche titles like SubHunt exemplify the appeal.

LLM perspective
- View: Hobbyist retro dev plus web emulation creates a viable distribution channel for dead platforms.
- Impact: More open Palm OS code and toolchains; better emulator/device support; renewed interest in offline-first game design.
- Watch next: rePalm ports, CloudPilot performance gains, StarGrid mods/maps, and whether IR/pass‑and‑play mechanics reappear on modern phones.
