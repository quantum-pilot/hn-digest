# Tesla is heading into multi-billion-dollar iceberg of its own making

- Score: 228 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45654635) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/10/20/tesla-heading-into-multi-billion-dollar-iceberg-of-own-making/

- TL;DR
    - Tesla’s FSD expansion exposed a hardware gap: HW3 cars (2019–2023) can’t reach unsupervised self-driving, while HW4 gets updates first. In Australia/NZ, FSD launched only on HW4, yet the app offers $149 AUD subscriptions to HW3 owners; Tesla also markets a $5,000 “loyalty” discount that appears generic. With up to $15,000 paid by hundreds of thousands, lawsuits in Australia, US, China put billions at stake. HN debates fraud vs fine print, chronicles years of overpromising, and splits on today’s FSD usefulness.

- Comment pulse
    - Refunds vs coupons → Paying $15k, then $10k only via new purchase feels exploitative; class actions allege misrepresentation — counterpoint: contracts may shield Tesla.
    - Overpromising drives risk → Musk’s “next year” FSD timelines and valuation tied to robotaxis; debate over Karpathy’s role reinforces systemic optimism bias.
    - FSD performance split → Some HW3 owners report daily near-hands-off use; others cite frequent interventions and degraded highway behavior; still not Level 5.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Hardware promises outpaced capability; staggered FSD support and ambiguous offers are accelerating legal, reputational, and cash-liability risks.
    - Impact: Potential refunds/retrofits compress margins; resale values suffer; regulators in Australia/US/China may demand clarity, refunds, or marketing restrictions.
    - Watch next: HW3 retrofit plan, timeline, and cost; HW3 update cadence; Australian class action outcomes; refunds for wrongly offered subscriptions.
