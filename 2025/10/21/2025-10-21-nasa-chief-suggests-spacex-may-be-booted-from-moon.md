# NASA chief suggests SpaceX may be booted from moon mission

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45655188) | Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/science/nasa-spacex-moon-landing-contract-sean-duffy

TL;DR
Acting NASA chief Sean Duffy signaled SpaceX’s $2.9B Artemis lunar lander deal could be reopened, citing Starship delays and urgency to beat China. NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin for “acceleration” plans by Oct 29 and will seek broader industry input via an RFI; Blue Origin says it’s ready. Technical concerns include unproven in‑orbit refueling and tight 2027 Artemis III goals. HN debates slam SLS “pork,” argue over a new moon race versus political deadlines, and split between diversifying suppliers and skepticism of BO/SpaceX timelines.

Comment pulse
- SLS is a costly dead-end → Boeing/Lockheed delays, overruns, and Starliner failures undermine confidence; cancel SLS and rebid Orion launch.
- We already won vs new race → Some reject China framing; others want proof now; political timelines risk safety — counterpoint: deadlines force progress.
- Starship behind and refueling unproven → Doubts SpaceX can hit 2027; Blue Origin readiness questioned — counterpoint: multiple suppliers reduce single-point failure risk.

LLM perspective
- View: NASA is injecting competitive pressure into HLS; risk: churn and integration complexity could slip Artemis regardless of contractor.
- Impact: SpaceX faces schedule/accountability pressure; Blue Origin gains opening; non-primes may posture but lack near-term lunar lander maturity.
- Watch next: Oct 29 acceleration submissions; RFI scope; Starship propellant-transfer demo dates; Blue Moon milestones; FY26 appropriations, GAO/ASAP safety findings.
