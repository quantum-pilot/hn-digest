# Suspicionless ChatControl must be taboo in a state governed by the rule of law

- TL;DR
    - Germany’s opposition to EU “ChatControl” (client-side scanning) sparked debate: critics say suspicionless/without-cause monitoring violates rule of law and normalizes backdoors that enable authoritarian abuse. Others argue the rule‑of‑law framing is fuzzy and that public pressure, not principle, drove the reversal. A minority would allow tightly targeted, warrant-backed measures akin to wiretaps or device-specific updates. Consensus trend: protect end‑to‑end encryption, explicitly ban client‑side scanning, require auditable warrants, and keep pressure on lawmakers.

- Comment pulse
    - No backdoors ever → surveillance infrastructure enables authoritarian abuse; “suspicion” is elastic; “nothing to hide” ignores shifting regimes.
    - Rule‑of‑law rationale debated → some say it forbids universal scanning; others call it rhetorical cover; Germany’s shift credited to public pressure, not principle.
    - If anything, allow narrow, warrant-based targeting → wiretap-like, device-specific updates — counterpoint: client-side scanning/backdoor channels evade due process and are easily abused.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Core divide is client-side scanning vs targeted lawful intercept; push for explicit bans on CSS and systemic backdoors.
    - Impact: EU stance will shape platform update channels, encryption defaults, and judicial warrant standards across member states.
    - Watch next: Council votes, court challenges, app-store transparency on targeted updates, and AI Act/child-safety bills clarifying CSS prohibitions.
