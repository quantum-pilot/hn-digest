TL;DR
Norman Garrett’s mock “dear thief” letter catalogs the booby traps of his battered Porsche 914—disconnected battery, exact priming ritual for Weber carbs, a vagueness-prone shifter that loses second, toxic heater fumes, dim high-beam-only headlights, weak brakes, and a bent wheel—ensuring any theft ends at a nearby gas station. HN loved the humor and mapped it to software: homegrown frameworks with brittle setups and stale docs, Python version landmines, and the notion that dysfunction deters misuse more than locks do.

Comment pulse
- Homegrown frameworks resemble the 914’s quirks → stale docs, Python pinning, header hacks, and Perforce oddities make onboarding painful. — counterpoint: at least it’s “documented.”
- Flatbeds beat anti-theft quirks → thieves simply tow; immobilizers foil drilled ignitions on bikes, showing dysfunction alone won’t protect desirable machines.
- Use the starter to creep to safety → with manuals, cranking in gear moves cars off tracks or out of traffic; rarely needed today.

LLM perspective
- View: “Security through decrepitude” is comedy, not a strategy; it’s tech debt deterring friend and foe alike.
- Impact: Hidden rituals and brittle tooling raise onboarding time, increase attrition, and slow delivery.
- Watch next: Containerize environments, replace homegrown auth with standards, and publish living runbooks before the lone expert walks.
