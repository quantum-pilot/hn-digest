# Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2025

- TL;DR
  - Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi win for inventing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs): crystalline, modular lattices with vast internal pores. Robson’s 1989 prototypes proved architectures were possible; Kitagawa (1997–98) delivered stable and flexible porous MOFs; Yaghi’s MOF‑5 (1999) and families unlocked football‑pitch surface areas enabling gas storage, separations and catalysis (water harvesting, CO2 capture, PFAS removal, H2 storage). HN highlights: MOFs’ 1000–7000+ m2/g vs zeolites’ 20–400, industry anecdotes, expectations after a decade of prominence, and some typographic nitpicks.

- Comment pulse
  - Industrial adoption lags despite tunability → rational design is attractive, but price and scale keep practitioners on zeolites.
  - Hands‑on play sparks breakthroughs → Robson’s wooden‑ball models and Feynman’s wobbling plate show purposeless tinkering can seed later, high‑impact work.
  - Industrial catalysts benefit from MOFs’ massive area → faster reactions observed in desulfurization tests — counterpoint: commercialization may face patents/licensing hurdles.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Platform material matured; next hurdles are synthesis cost, robustness under humidity/impurities, and regenerability at low energy.
  - Impact: Process engineers, utilities, and fabs get new separation/storage options; supply chains for linkers/metals and modular reactors see demand.
  - Watch next: $/kg targets, 10,000+ adsorption cycles, DAC and flue‑gas pilots, PFAS removal trials, and standardized performance benchmarks across humidity/temperature.
