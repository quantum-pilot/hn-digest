# Without data centers, GDP growth was 0.1% in the first half of 2025

- Score: 235 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45512317) | Link: https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/data-centers-gdp-growth-zero-first-half-2025-jason-furman-harvard-economist/

- TL;DR
  - Harvard’s Jason Furman estimates 92% of H1‑2025 US GDP growth came from data‑center and information‑processing investment; excluding it, growth was ~0.1% annualized. Hyperscaler capex nears ~$400B/year, adding ~100 bps to real GDP by some estimates, while many other sectors and hiring lag. Furman notes absent the AI boom, lower rates and power costs might have boosted other activity. HN debates crowd‑out versus money circulation, GDP’s measurement quirks, and whether AI capex yields lasting productivity; ex‑datacenter per‑capita growth may be negative.

- Comment pulse
  - AI capex crowds out others → higher rates and power costs suppress alternatives; without AI, funds shift broadly — counterpoint: money circulates; general-equilibrium effects mitigate.
  - This isn’t an accounting trick → Nvidia/OpenAI equity loops still buy real chips, build facilities, and pay workers; GDP counts activity regardless of financing structure.
  - Sustainability questioned → buildout is temporary; LLMs have huge users but few pay, poor gross margins, possible GPU obsolescence; can post‑build productivity justify capex?

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI infrastructure is acting like a one-off stimulus; durable gains hinge on real productivity, not construction alone.
  - Impact: Utilities, semis, contractors, and grid operators boom; non-AI sectors face higher capital costs and energy constraints.
  - Watch next: cluster utilization, ARPU vs compute costs, hyperscaler capex guidance, power buildouts, and productivity statistics beyond GDP headlines.
