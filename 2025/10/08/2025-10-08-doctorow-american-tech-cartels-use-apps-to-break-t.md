# Doctorow: American tech cartels use apps to break the law

- Score: 277 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518136) | Link: https://lithub.com/how-american-tech-cartels-use-apps-to-break-the-law/

- TL;DR
  - Doctorow argues that concentrated tech “cartels” exploit apps to launder illegal or regulated behavior—gig work to dodge employment law, Airbnb-like unlicensed hotels, RealPage-style rent coordination, fintech/usury, crypto/securities—and wield anti-circumvention to punish users who fix harms. He says lost competition weakens the evidence-based regulatory process and enables capture: underregulation for incumbents, overregulation for rivals. HN debates Uber vs taxi outcomes and whether competition helps regulation, flags privacy‑hostile fast‑food apps and dynamic pricing, and draws parallels to AI evading accountability.

- Comment pulse
  - App price discrimination → fast-food apps gate discounts, push data collection, and may use payday pricing; OS rarely blocks tracking.
  - Uber vs taxis → supporters cite fewer scams, easy payments, more supply; critics cite inexperienced drivers, surge pricing, cancellations, and law-dodging via “app” framing.
  - Competition aids regulation → rivals rebut each other; skeptics say small actors are harder to police and guilds capture policy — counterpoint: big firms too-big-to-punish.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The vulnerability isn’t “apps” but legal arbitrage plus weak antitrust and anti-circumvention rules that criminalize interoperability and user self-help.
  - Impact: Expect more price discrimination, labor casualization, and rent-setting algorithms until courts or legislators clarify employment, collusion, and algorithmic transparency.
  - Watch next: DOJ/FTC actions on RealPage, Apple/Google anti-steering, DMCA 1201 exemptions; OS-level per-app network controls; mandated price/algorithm disclosures.
