# Ortega hypothesis

- TL;DR
  - The Ortega hypothesis says many small, “mediocre” contributions underpin breakthroughs; the Newton view credits a few giants. Citation studies often favor Newton, but HN argues citations are biased by fame, networks, and theory-heavy work, undervaluing tacit tools, experiments, and teaching. Some emphasize mid-tier scientists sustain knowledge and capacity; others warn that “numbers” can amplify fraud. Many conclude both dynamics coexist under power-law outputs and paradigm shifts built on years of unglamorous work and concurrent discoveries. Ortega himself emphasized geniuses framing the commons.

- Comment pulse
  - Mass participation preserves know-how → teaching and work keep fields alive; examples: Abrams pipeline, FOGBANK relearned after attrition — counterpoint: mediocrity risks fraud and replication.
  - Citations distort influence → fame, recency, and Matthew effects skew who gets cited; citation rings and theory bias inflate counts, ignoring tools and experiments.
  - Both models operate → power-law output and resources create stars, while years of experiments erode wrong paradigms; concurrent discoveries gauge difficulty in the online era.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Evaluate contributions beyond citations; include replication, tooling, datasets, tutorials, and teaching in assessments and funding decisions.
  - Impact: Diversifying metrics reduces star-system distortions, supports mid-career researchers, and strengthens institutional memory and crisis readiness.
  - Watch next: Track citation concentration, altmetrics, replication rates, and skill attrition; run audits of abandoned know‑how and reconstitution costs.
