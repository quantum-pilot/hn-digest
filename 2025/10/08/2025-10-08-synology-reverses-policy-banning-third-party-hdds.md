# Synology reverses policy banning third-party HDDs

- Score: 1001 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45513485) | Link: https://www.guru3d.com/story/synology-reverses-policy-banning-thirdparty-hdds-after-nas-sales-plummet/

- TL;DR
    - Synology is rolling back its third‑party drive lockouts in DSM 7.3 after a customer backlash and falling 2025 NAS sales. Reports say non‑Synology HDDs and 2.5" SATA SSDs regain full functionality. HN welcomes the move but stresses deeper issues: aging hardware/software, removed features, and lost trust; many already jumped to TrueNAS, UGREEN, or Ubiquiti UNAS. Some question if HDD support is fully restored, citing stale docs; others argue the original policy targeted unreliable consumer SMR drives.

- Comment pulse
    - Management misread customers → trust loss hurts sales and retention; morale damage risks attrition — counterpoint: stricter hardware policy may have reduced unmanageable support load.
    - Stagnant hardware/software → old CPUs, 1–2.5G NICs, removed transcoding; NVMe/10G scarce. Users migrate to TrueNAS, UGREEN NAS, Ubiquiti UNAS for performance and flexibility.
    - Reversal scope disputed → some cite KB showing only 2.5" SATA SSDs allowed; others say docs are stale. Some justify blocking unreliable consumer SMR drives.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The rollback is necessary but insufficient; Synology must rebuild trust with openness and a credible hardware/software roadmap.
    - Impact: Third‑party drive support lowers TCO, pressures Synology-branded drive margins, and intensifies competition from ZFS- and 10G/NVMe-focused vendors.
    - Watch next: Updated compatibility matrix, DSM 7.3 benchmarks with third-party drives, new 10G/NVMe models, transcoding policy, and whether sales and goodwill rebound.
