# The weaponization of travel blacklists

- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45515783) | Link: https://papersplease.org/wp/2025/10/06/the-weaponization-of-travel-blacklists/

- TL;DR
    - A Senate hearing examined TSA’s Quiet Skies, which had Federal Air Marshals surveil preselected travelers and fuse flight data with license-plate reads, driven by watchlists and profiling. Targets reportedly included Jan 6-linked spenders and Gaza critics. Though DHS Secretary Kristi Noehm ended Quiet Skies and fired five TSA leaders, the article says the broader bipartisan watchlist system persists and lacks due process, urging a statutory right to travel. HN debates 4th-vs-5th Amendment issues, AI scaling, and “credit” vs consolidation under TSC/ICE.

- Comment pulse
    - Public surveillance is lawful → Observing in public needs no warrant; the harm is opaque watchlists denying travel — counterpoint: data fusion creates warrantless dossiers.
    - Ending Quiet Skies deserves credit → DHS fired five TSA leaders; skeptics see power shifting to TSC/ICE and contractors rather than restraint.
    - Manual logs are chilling → FAM notes documented minute behaviors; with AI, similar tracking could scale to many travelers at low cost.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The core fix is statute-backed travel rights plus judicial review; oversight must cover multi-agency watchlisting and data fusion.
    - Impact: Airlines, TSA, CBP, TSC, and vendors would face discovery risk and stricter criteria before denying boarding or flagging travelers.
    - Watch next: Freedom to Travel Act reintroduction; audits of Quiet Skies data; rulings in Fikre and Jardaneh defining actionable harm.
