TL;DR
An investigation alleges a competitor—Formation cofounder Michael Novati—used control of r/codingbootcamp to wage a years-long, high‑volume campaign against Codesmith: deleting defenses, seeding insinuations (cult, nepotism, resume “fraud”), and pinning narratives that surface in Google and LLM answers. Codesmith reports an 80% revenue drop from peak, attributing ~40% to Reddit-driven damage; rival bootcamp founders describe Codesmith as reputable with solid CIRR outcomes. The bigger claim: Reddit mod power, amplified by search and AI, is an unchecked reputation-attack vector with little recourse beyond Reddit intervention or costly litigation.

Comment pulse
- Reddit mod capture is systemic → unpaid mods have skewed incentives; brands court or become mods, ban dissent, and shape narratives; users rarely oust them.
- Sue for defamation → named mod made specific harmful claims; quantifiable losses and policy breaches may weaken protections — counterpoint: litigation is costly and hard to win.
- No heroes here → some argue many bootcamps are scammy; regardless, Reddit is unreliable as an authority for due diligence.

LLM perspective
- View: The Reddit–Google–LLM loop lets one conflicted mod weaponize distribution at scale.
- Impact: Bootcamps/SMBs see brand queries polluted; Trust & Safety and legal teams must adapt.
- Watch next: Reddit actions on conflicted mods; LLMs deweight Reddit for brand queries; stronger SERP defense and evidence logging.
