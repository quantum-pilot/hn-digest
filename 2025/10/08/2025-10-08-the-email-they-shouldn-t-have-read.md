# The email they shouldn't have read

- Score: 368 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45515657) | Link: https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/10/08/the-email-they-shouldnt-have-read/

- TL;DR
    - An IT consultant recounts migrating public agencies from an overpriced “open‑source” managed email to self‑hosted, then facing vendor retaliation: secret contract amendments, disabled IMAP/SMTP, price hikes, and signs emails were monitored (“we could; it’s in the contract”). One agency backed out after threats claiming exclusive installer status; another got trapped by auto‑renewal. Pre‑GDPR, lax terms enabled abuse; lesson: own your stack and scrutinize contracts. HN readers echo vendor kickbacks, policy noncompliance, and HR-led tooling churn—while debating naming names versus legal risk.

- Comment pulse
    - Management often leaks, promises contracts, or ignores security; kickbacks suspected at big firms. Challenging them risks exclusion from decisions.
    - Name-and-shame urged → accountability. — counterpoint: individuals face litigation, retaliation, and minimal upside; anonymizing protects staff more than companies.
    - Story phrasing confused readers (“this solution” meant self‑hosting). Broader gripe: HR/tooling churn and AI vendors ingesting enterprise data until legal intervenes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Managed open‑source isn’t safe by default; contracts can recreate proprietary lock‑in and permit intrusive access.
    - Impact: Public procurement and IT governance must mandate DPAs, audit logs, exit/portability SLAs, and forbid unilateral amendments.
    - Watch next: Customer‑held keys, mailbox encryption, immutable access logs; quarterly token reviews; contracts with kill‑switches for access and data export.
