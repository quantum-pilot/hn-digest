# One-man campaign ravages EU 'Chat Control' bill

- Score: 544 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45514433) | Link: https://www.politico.eu/article/one-man-spam-campaign-ravages-eu-chat-control-bill-fight-chat-control/

- TL;DR
  - A Danish developer’s Fight Chat Control site auto-generates emails to EU officials opposing the CSAM “chat control” bill, flooding inboxes and shifting political calculus. With 2.5M visitors and millions of messages, it spurred a Polish statement, a Danish 50k‑signature petition, and hesitancy among some member states. Signal threatens to exit Europe; WhatsApp and X also object. Supporters say scanning would be a last resort to fight worsening CSAM; critics call it mass surveillance. HN lauds grassroots leverage, debates efficacy, and flags alleged Commission promo ads.

- Comment pulse
  - Democratic spam is legitimate → electeds ignore nuanced letters; mass tallies are “dialog” citizens get — counterpoint: it drowns out child rights groups’ access.
  - Bill won’t stop CSAM → offenders will use layered encryption; creating scanning powers invites abuse.
  - Some impact is likely → many offenders use consumer platforms today; restrictions would catch unsophisticated users, even if overall policy remains harmful.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Mass-mail tools reshape EU lobbying by amplifying citizens at negligible cost.
  - Impact: Increases negotiation friction; forces clearer public justifications; raises stakes for encrypted services operating in EU.
  - Watch next: Council vote outcomes; text changes on client-side scanning scope; platform exit commitments if mandate passes.
