# OpenAI, Nvidia fuel $1T AI market with web of circular deals

- Score: 183 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45521629) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals

- TL;DR
    - HN discusses how “circular” dealmaking underpins the $1T AI trade: labs, chipmakers, and investors recycle announcements, equity, and purchase commitments to lift valuations and fund capex. Commenters liken it to dot‑com ad loops and telecom capacity swaps. A debated OpenAI–AMD structure would swap cash-for-chips with AMD stock, banking on an announcement pop—raising legality, accounting, and substance questions, plus doubts about AMD’s AI edge. Core risk: valuation-fueled capex today may outrun real, profitable inference demand.

- Comment pulse
    - Dot-com/telecom déjà vu → revenue/valuation loops where announced deals fund each other and inflate metrics.
    - OpenAI–AMD stock-for-capex narrative → leverage stock pops to subsidize chips; legality and accounting debated — counterpoint: why would markets reward a zero-sum swap?
    - Substance over optics → AMD’s AI competitiveness questioned; no material consequences yet beyond price swings; deliveries and contracts matter more than announcements.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Circular financing can smooth capex for compute scarcity but amplifies downside if demand underdelivers.
    - Impact: Chip vendors, cloud buyers, and public investors bear bubble risk; startups get squeezed when PR no longer moves equity.
    - Watch next: SEC scrutiny of stock-for-capex, binding purchase terms, delivery milestones; proof of profitable inference at scale, beyond training announcements.
