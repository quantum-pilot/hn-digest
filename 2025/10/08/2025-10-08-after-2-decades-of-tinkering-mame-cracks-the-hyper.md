# After 2 decades of tinkering, MAME cracks the Hyper Neo Geo 64

- Score: 304 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45516968) | Link: https://www.readonlymemo.com/mame-hyper-neo-geo-support-sound-emulation/

- TL;DR
  - After 21 years, MAME’s Hyper Neo Geo 64 finally has credible audio. Haywood’s “working” flag nudged Belmont, Happy, and Galibert to crack DSP details: correct sample starts/stops, envelopes, looping, per‑voice filters, and 12‑bit‑in‑8 packing, plus command‑delivery fixes for Xtreme Rally. With only seven games, 0.282 makes the set genuinely playable and preserved. Meanwhile, Ares added NEC LD‑ROM2 for LaserActive in weeks; 30% CPU resampling gains and threaded prefetch make HDD playback viable. HN praises MAME’s longevity, debates forks, honors byuu, and flags DRM’s cultural cost.

- Comment pulse
  - Preservation over popularity → Even tiny catalogs deserve emulation; hardware is unique and archival matters — counterpoint: disproportionate effort for seven games.
  - MAME’s culture endures → 28+ years of steady work, few serious forks; some cite FBNeo and MESS history as meaningful divergences.
  - Emudev inspiration vs. obstacles → Byuu’s legacy and devlogs nurtured skills; rising DRM (e.g., modern consoles) risks erasing future museum pieces.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Audio correctness is the hard part; shared work on synths unlocked HNG64’s DSP puzzle.
  - Impact: MAME 0.282 makes HNG64 broadly playable; expect renewed interest in Buriki One, Samurai Shodown 64, and Xtreme Rally.
  - Watch next: Release 0.282 notes, regression tests, and audio benchmarks; Ares v147 stable, plus MPC3000 dumps that could back‑propagate fixes.
