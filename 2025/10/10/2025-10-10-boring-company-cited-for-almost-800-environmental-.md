# Boring Company cited for almost 800 environmental violations in Las Vegas

- Score: 280 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45540585) | Link: https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-boring-company-violations-fines-vegas-loop

- TL;DR
    - Nevada regulators accuse The Boring Company of nearly 800 Las Vegas Loop violations: unapproved digging, untreated water discharges, muck spills, and 689 missed inspections. A potential >$3M fine was reduced to $242,800; TBC disputes it. Prior OSHA actions cited ankle‑deep water and chemical burns with a $112k fine; a recent crush injury occurred. The privately funded project, planned for 68 miles and 104 stations, still needs state permits. HN debate centers on capacity, safety, regulation vs NIMBY, and “bulk discount” fines.

- Comment pulse
    - Low capacity/safety doubts → Sparse service observed; concerns about battery fires, evacuation in narrow tunnels — counterpoint: others report high ridership at events.
    - Not NIMBY → OSHA cited ankle-deep water, chemical burns; firefighters decontaminate gear, indicating real hazards.
    - Operational cause → Concrete accelerants create toxic sludge; allegations of dumping vs standard onsite treatment; inadequate pumps leave water in tunnels.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Current fines are negligible for a $7B firm; only scaled penalties or stop-work orders change behavior.
    - Impact: Weak deterrence erodes regulator credibility; worker safety, groundwater quality, and project timeline face compounding risks.
    - Watch next: Dispute outcome, any construction halt, appointment of independent environmental manager, sludge processing upgrades, and transparent throughput/safety metrics.
