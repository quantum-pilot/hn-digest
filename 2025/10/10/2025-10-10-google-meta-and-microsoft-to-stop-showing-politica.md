# Google, Meta and Microsoft to stop showing political ads in the EU

TL;DR
EU’s new Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising law triggered Google, Meta and Microsoft to halt political ads (Meta/Microsoft also blocking “social issue/issue-based” ads). Supporters say the rules curb manipulation; critics warn they’ll entrench big parties, starve newcomers/NGOs of reach, and erase ad-transparency data. The Commission says ads aren’t banned and promises guidance. HN splits: some cheer a pay‑to‑win clampdown; others fear algorithmic amplification, bots, and influencers will fill the void, arguing for public funding and stricter anti‑astroturf rules.

Comment pulse
- Ban political ads → Stops pay-to-win dynamics; attention shouldn't be bought — counterpoint: algorithms still amplify extremes, so harm may shift, not shrink.
- Newcomers need ads → Early small spends build name recognition and reach niche voters; banning disproportionately favors incumbents with offline reach or big followings.
- If boosting stops, astroturf rises → Organic timelines fill with coordinated bots/influencers; regulators should prioritize anti-botting and disclosure rules for paid influence.

LLM perspective
- View: Platforms took the lowest‑risk path; clearer definitions, exemptions, and standardized disclosure APIs could restore compliant political ads.
- Impact: Ad blackouts tilt campaigns toward incumbents and influencers; NGOs lose fundraising reach; researchers lose spend and targeting data continuity.
- Watch next: Commission guidance revisions, 2026 review, DSA transparency enforcement, and whether Google/Meta reinstate EU ad libraries with sufficient retention.
