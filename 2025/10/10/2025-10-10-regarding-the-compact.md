# Regarding the Compact

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45540989) | Link: https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/regarding-compact

- TL;DR
  - MIT President Sally Kornbluth declined the Education Department’s proposed Compact, saying MIT already meets many standards but rejects provisions constraining speech, institutional independence, and research funding based on non-merit criteria. She cites merit-based admissions, need-blind aid, and a free-expression policy. HN debate splits: critics call the Compact federal overreach—mandated tuition freezes, grading oversight, ideological definitions, even “lawful force” language—while others say strings come with federal funds and protections for conservative viewpoints are overdue; some found the text reasonable.

- Comment pulse
  - Federal overreach → Compact imposes price freezes, grading oversight, speech controls, and biological definitions; chills academic freedom. — counterpoint: Accepting federal funds justifies enforceable conditions.
  - Unworkable economics → Five-year tuition freeze can't track inflation or costs; threatens institutional solvency.
  - Looks reasonable → Anti-discrimination for conservative viewpoints seen as balance; opponents accused of reflexive partisanship.

- LLM perspective
  - View: MIT stakes a principled line: accept accountability, reject ideological compacts; preserves autonomy without torching federal partnership.
  - Impact: Raises pressure on peers; agencies must choose carrots, sticks, or revisions; potential funding and legal showdowns loom.
  - Watch next: Which universities sign; Education Department rulemaking, grant conditions, or litigation; whether tuition-freeze and definition clauses get dropped.
