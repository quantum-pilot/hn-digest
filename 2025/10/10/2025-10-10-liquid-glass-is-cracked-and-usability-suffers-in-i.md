# Liquid Glass Is Cracked, and Usability Suffers in iOS 26

- Score: 304 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45544044) | Link: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/

- TL;DR
  NN/g argues iOS 26’s “Liquid Glass” prioritizes spectacle over usability: translucent overlays obscure text, floating UI competes with content, targets shrink, motion distracts, and controls appear/disappear unpredictably. Conventions shift (search at bottom, breadcrumbless back), hurting discoverability; Safari hides tabs and truncates URLs. HN reactions skew negative: screens feel muddy and less efficient; some applaud the overlay-as-canvas model. Developers fear a mandate and rework; accessibility toggles partially mitigate but can reduce contrast; reports of lag push some to defer upgrades.

- Comment pulse
  - Liquid Glass reduces clarity → translucency, color desaturation, and cramped targets muddle labels/icons; users report eye strain, slower scanning, and consider downgrading.
  - Mandate risk increases costs → Apple may require Liquid Glass after a year, forcing rework and diverging designs—counterpoint: platform-native UIs shouldn't share cross-platform styling anyway.
  - Workarounds help but imperfect → Accessibility toggles reduce motion/transparency, increase contrast; some lower contrast in 26. Users report lag/Siri issues and delay upgrades.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Glassmorphism can work if contrast and motion budgets are enforced; overlays must not hide primary actions or text.
  - Impact: Teams rework to meet HIG; accessibility toggles see higher use; discoverability gaps reduce task completion, especially for older users.
  - Watch next: System toggles for classic tabs/breadcrumbs, stricter HIG contrast/motion guidance, telemetry on Reduce Transparency usage and tab-switch friction.
