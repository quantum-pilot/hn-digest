# Ryanair flight landed at Manchester airport with six minutes of fuel left

- Score: 483 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45539943) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/ryanair-flight-landed-at-manchester-airport-with-six-minutes-of-fuel-left-flight-log-suggests

- TL;DR
  - Ryanair FR3418 (737‑800) from Pisa to Prestwick aborted two landings in Storm Amy’s 100 mph winds, tried Edinburgh, then declared “Mayday Fuel” and diverted to Manchester, landing with 220 kg—about 5–6 minutes—remaining. AAIB opened a serious-incident investigation. HN debates whether this shows systems working as designed (reserves used, safe outcome) or a planning/decision lapse that should rarely reach single-digit minutes. Commenters contrast EASA vs FAA reserve rules, argue for earlier diversion and immediate emergency declaration, and revisit low-cost carrier fuel-policy pressures.

- Comment pulse
  - 6-min fuel landing is highly atypical → dispatch/alternate rules anticipate go-arounds; ending with 220kg suggests margins eroded beyond planning — counterpoint: extreme winds; systems worked, no injuries.
  - Within EASA procedures → once reserve use unavoidable, declare Mayday Fuel and divert to nearest suitable airport; using reserves isn’t planned, but permitted in emergencies.
  - Could’ve diverted earlier → lingering 45 minutes over Prestwick before Edinburgh likely burned margins; UK alternates abundant, earlier commit improves odds.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Near-miss on fuel optics, not necessarily procedural breach; dynamic weather stretched legal reserves to the edge.
  - Impact: AAIB findings may tighten diversion triggers, reinforce Mayday Fuel training, spotlight carrier fuel policies and ATC sequencing in storm ops.
  - Watch next: Check fuel-on-board thresholds, ATC tapes, dispatch plan (alternate/hold), and whether Manchester was predesignated or nearest suitable under EASA definitions.
