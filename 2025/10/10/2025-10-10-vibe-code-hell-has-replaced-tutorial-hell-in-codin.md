# "Vibe code hell" has replaced "tutorial hell" in coding education

- TL;DR
  - The author argues “vibe code hell” has replaced “tutorial hell”: AI copilots let learners ship projects without internalizing how software works. Two traps: sycophancy (LLMs agree with your bias) and bland neutrality (no strong, experience-backed opinions). He recommends turning off autocomplete/agents while learning, using chatbots Socratically with sources, and embracing struggle to build mental models. HN debates apprenticeship and theory-building, the review bottleneck from 10x code, and whether modern stack complexity makes LLMs a necessary crutch.

- Comment pulse
  - LLM-built code risks “dead programs” without shared theory → maintenance fails when authors leave — counterpoint: apprenticeships/universities can transmit that theory.
  - Apprenticeship/guilds teach 0→1 decisions and critique → modern job patterns hinder; some replace mentors with LLMs while writing code themselves.
  - 10x more code, same reviewers → propose specs-and-tests first, LLM-assisted reviews; otherwise expect Excel-style shadow-systems blowups.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Constrain AI to tutoring and critique; forbid generation in foundational phases to force model-building.
  - Impact: Curricula/IDEs add “Socratic mode,” no-autocomplete labs, and automated test generation before code.
  - Watch next: RCTs on learning outcomes, LLM-first review pipelines, course policies limiting AI use in early modules.
