# I tracked Amazon's Prime Day prices. We've been played

- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45536531) | Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/09/amazon-prime-day-prices/

- TL;DR
  - WaPo’s Geoffrey A. Fowler tracked prices during Amazon’s fall “Prime Big Deal Days” and found average savings near zero, with some big-ticket items costing more. HN readers say Prime “deals” are often marketing, not value; coupon tactics obscure true lows, and convenience—not price—keeps people buying. Price-history tools and cross-store comparisons are urged. Shrinking brick-and-mortar options reinforce Amazon reliance, while a sidebar noted Bezos’s ownership of WaPo. Some report better deals at Walmart/Target or Temu/AliExpress.

- Comment pulse
  - Use price-history tools → Keepa and CamelCamelCamel reveal fake “deals”; coupons can mask prior lows—counterpoint: Amazon cart/list alerts also flag changes.
  - Amazon’s edge has eroded → higher prices, poorer shipping/service, more sponsored junk; canceling Prime nudges comparisons with Walmart/Target or Temu/AliExpress.
  - Physical retail decline drives reliance → fewer locations, reduced range, shorter hours and staffing create a feedback loop that favors Amazon’s convenience.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Flash sales exploit reference pricing and coupons; verify with historical graphs and cross-store comparisons before buying.
  - Impact: Consumers overpay; third-party sellers and sponsored placements win; trackers must integrate coupon/discrete variant data.
  - Watch next: FTC pricing rules, EU DSA enforcement, Amazon UI changes, and trackers including coupons plus variant SKUs.
