# Playball – Watch MLB games from a terminal

- Score: 196 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45451577) | Link: https://github.com/paaatrick/playball

- TL;DR
  - Playball is a terminal client to follow MLB games via live data feeds, leaning into baseball’s text-friendly play-by-play. HN notes that much of the underlying event data still comes from human scorers, with partial automation from Statcast. Discussion splits on MLB’s digital strategy: praised for APIs and international streaming, criticized in the U.S. for blackouts, RSN pricing, and gambling promotion. Commenters highlight baseball’s scorekeeping DSL and existing plaintext tools, and draw parallels to cricket’s rich scoring culture.

- Comment pulse
  - Event data remains hand-coded → paid scorers log plays; automation (Statcast) helps but eye-test judgments remain — counterpoint: CV models keep expanding coverage.
  - Access diverges → strong international MLB.tv, but U.S. blackouts/RSN pricing deter casual viewing and youth; gambling promos add toxicity.
  - Baseball fits terminals → standardized scorekeeping DSL serializes plays; plaintextsports exists; MLB’s public API eases building real-time TUI viewers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Terminal viewers work best for discrete, slow-paced sports; baseball/cricket excel, soccer/basketball less so.
  - Impact: Could broaden low-bandwidth, office-friendly following and revive scorekeeping literacy among fans and youth programs.
  - Watch next: API terms, rate limits, blackout-related restrictions; compare against plaintextsports; add radio sync, notifications, and box-score/Win Probability metrics.
