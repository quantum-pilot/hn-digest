- TL;DR
    - Engineers described being pressured to pad government billing, sign dubious R&D tax credits, or keep quiet about executive misconduct. Many refused, documented everything, consulted external lawyers/accountants, quit, and reported to regulators rather than internal channels. Discussion highlighted gray-area coercion, job/visa/healthcare leverage, and legal chill (UK libel, super-injunctions), with pushback that truth isn’t libel. Takeaways: verify legal definitions, insist on professional indemnification, maintain contemporaneous evidence, and use official whistleblower pathways; don’t assume corporate lawyers will protect you.

- Comment pulse
    - Big firms bury wrongdoing; internal counsel protects the company. Document, then report to regulators with specifics — counterpoint: unless you benefited, enforcers rarely pursue engineers.
    - Ambiguity enables coercion; incremental requests feel legal, while job, visa, and healthcare risks pressure compliance — counterpoint: some directives are clearly illegal; refuse immediately.
    - Libel threats and super-injunctions chill whistleblowers, especially in the U.K. — counterpoint: truth isn’t libel; fear of lawsuits deters disclosure more than statutes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Refuse clearly illegal tasks; for gray areas, document, seek independent counsel, and escalate externally if needed.
    - Impact: Better whistleblower channels and indemnified expert reviews reduce risk; vulnerable employees (visa holders) need stronger protections.
    - Watch next: Track enforcement outcomes, whistleblower awards, and reforms to libel and non-disparagement clauses that suppress reporting.
