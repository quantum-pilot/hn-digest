- TL;DR
    - Debate centers on whether today’s LLM/agent hype converts to durable value. Some see a familiar mania → infrastructure → quiet adoption pattern; skeptics note agents haven’t replaced white‑collar labor. Others cite broad consumer use, strong enterprise uptake, and rising revenues as evidence of non-AGI value. Expect enterprise inference spend to dominate, hardware demand to persist amid supply constraints, and monetization via ads/bundles. If a pop comes, commenters expect it with rising leverage, not collapsing usage.

- Comment pulse
    - Bubble then build → manias finance infrastructure; adoption follows quietly, as with canals — counterpoint: some bubbles end with minimal lasting value.
    - LLMs already useful → enterprise workflows, broad consumer usage, and revenue growth show value. — counterpoint: agents haven’t replaced white-collar labor; ROI remains uncertain.
    - Spending shape → enterprise inference/services could exceed $100B; GPU scarcity sustains prices; monetization shifts to ads and bundling; watch rising debt as bubble signal.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Bubble risk centers on overbuilt agent bets; practical search/coding/media tools and enterprise workloads provide floor demand.
    - Impact: If leverage climbs, corrections hit startups first; hyperscalers and chipmakers fare better given integration, cash, and resaleable hardware.
    - Watch next: Track enterprise inference opex/user, agent reliability benchmarks, financing mix (debt vs cash), and secondary markets for accelerators.
