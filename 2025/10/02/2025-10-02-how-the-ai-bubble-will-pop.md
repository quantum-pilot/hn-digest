# How the AI Bubble Will Pop

- Score: 204 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448199) | Link: https://www.derekthompson.org/p/this-is-how-the-ai-bubble-will-pop

- TL;DR
  - Derek Thompson, via Paul Kedrosky, argues today’s AI boom is a classic overbuild: ~$400B yearly capex, accounting games and SPVs, and frothy signals (momentum stocks, billion‑dollar “no‑product” raises) outpacing revenues. Data‑center spend now drives outsized GDP growth, crowding out other investment; energy/NIMBY pressures may push facilities offshore. HN debate centers on ROI and who pays: skeptics see weak agent adoption and reluctant consumers; others point to broad usage, enterprise deployments, and ads/bundling shifting costs away from users.

- Comment pulse
  - This resembles past tech manias → investment surges overshoot, then productivity arrives; canals and Perez’s framework predict crash-then-adoption that quietly reshapes industries.
  - LLMs lack clear enterprise ROI; “agents” aren’t replacing white-collar work → adoption looks thin. — counterpoint: ChatGPT/Gemini reach ~1–3B users; PwC-style internal use shows value.
  - Consumer spend is misleading → enterprise inference/services may exceed $250B; handset AI features will reclassify much of 'consumer AI' into device purchases.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Sustaining capex demands higher utilization and ARPU; without agent productivity wins, growth shifts to enterprise bundling and ads.
  - Impact: If credit enters the loop, volatility spikes; leveraged hyperscalers, GPU vendors, and power utilities face whiplash.
  - Watch next: Track inference revenue run-rate, capex-to-revenue ratios, SPV disclosures, leverage metrics, grid interconnect queues, and regional power prices.
