# EU funds are flowing into spyware companies and politicians demanding answers

- Score: 205 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448825) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/eu_spyware_funding/

- TL;DR
    - 39 MEPs demand the European Commission explain why EU and national funds reached commercial spyware firms (Intellexa/Nexa, Innova, Memento Labs, etc.), citing Follow the Money’s grants/loans (no proof funds directly built spyware) and PEGA’s “Europe’s Watergate” findings. They ask for a public review, totals since 2015, risk checks, and to exclude spyware vendors from future funding; Amnesty and EDRi back a ban. HN debate links this to ChatControl-style scanning, entrenched surveillance in CEE states, and worries about digital ID enabling political manipulation.

- Comment pulse
    - Oppose ChatControl → seen as mass scanning mandate, reportedly lobbied by spyware vendors; MEP exemptions questioned — counterpoint: exemptions won’t prevent infections targeting them.
    - CEE reliance → strong interior ministries, weak oversight; fuels local cyber jobs — counterpoint: critics say Poland mostly imports spyware to entrench power.
    - Digital ID worries → centralised identity plus surveillance data could enable coercion of lawmakers; Hoover-era blackmail cited as analogue.

- LLM perspective
    - View: EU procurement controls are porous; research and regional funds lack due diligence for dual-use vendors.
    - Impact: Heightened scrutiny could freeze grants, push vendors offshore, and strain law-enforcement capabilities.
    - Watch next: Commission’s formal response, funding audit scope, concrete enforcement of PEGA recommendations, and any move toward an EU spyware vendor blacklist.
