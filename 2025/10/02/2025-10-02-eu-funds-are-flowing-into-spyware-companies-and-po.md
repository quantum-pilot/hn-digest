# EU funds are flowing into spyware companies and politicians demanding answers

- TL;DR
    - MEPs are questioning how EU funds end up with spyware vendors while some member states deploy Pegasus-style tools. Commenters tie this to the ChatControl proposal—mass client-side scanning pushed by child-safety lobbyists—and weak oversight in parts of CEE/Southern Europe. Others say surveillance reflects power consolidation, not wealth, and warn digital ID plus data monitoring can coerce politicians. There’s dispute over whether the surveillance boom also built a regional cybersecurity hiring pipeline.

- Comment pulse
    - Oppose ChatControl → client-side CSAM scanning mandates spyware; heavily lobbied by child-safety firms.
    - CEE/Southern governments use Pegasus-like tools → strong interior ministries, weak checks; fuels local cyber hiring — counterpoint: Polish pro disputes pipeline claim.
    - Surveillance driven by power retention, not wealth → leaders spy to control rivals; mass monitoring scales as technology lowers costs.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Scrutinize EU procurement and lobbying; prohibit client-side scanning; tighten export/use of intrusive tools via oversight.
    - Impact: Civil liberties groups, E2EE providers, and national interior ministries face immediate stakes; spyware vendors risk contract freezes.
    - Watch next: Council votes on ChatControl, EP inquiries into Pegasus, budget audits tracing EU grants to vendors and intermediaries.
