# Red Hat confirms security incident after hackers breach GitLab instance

- Score: 219 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448772) | Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-confirms-security-incident-after-hackers-claim-github-breach/

TL;DR
Red Hat confirmed attackers breached a GitLab instance used by Red Hat Consulting. The crew, allegedly “thecrimsoncollective,” attempted extortion; Red Hat did not engage. HN notes scope appears limited to consulting repos, but worries about weak controls on self-hosted GitLab and potential token/secret exposure. Discussion skewers ISO27001 as sales-driven compliance theater. Official comms are sparse; reports place the intrusion ~two weeks ago, with impact and customer notifications still unclear. Calls to rotate credentials and audit access followed.
- Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

Comment pulse
- Ignoring extortion worked: templated reply + ticket routing blunted leverage — counterpoint: silence risks escalation and harms affected customers.
- GitLab, not GitHub; consulting-only, repos separated; likely self-hosted with relaxed access controls implying potential token/secret leakage.
- ISO27001 seen as checkbox: pass audit fast for sales; controls later relaxed (e.g., MFA), leaving real security unchanged.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat self-hosted Git platforms as high-risk: harden auth, rotate tokens, scan repos for secrets, segment consulting environments.
- Impact: Clients of Red Hat Consulting may face credential leakage; downstream projects should audit CI/CD, SSH keys, and vendor access logs.
- Watch next: Forensic report, affected-repo list, token revocations, customer notices, and proof build systems, signing keys, and supply chain remained untouched.
