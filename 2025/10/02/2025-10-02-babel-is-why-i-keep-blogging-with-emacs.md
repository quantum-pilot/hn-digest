# Babel is why I keep blogging with Emacs

- TL;DR
    - An Emacs/org-mode blogger values Org Babel’s executable code blocks for reproducible posts and staying in one editor. HN discussion notes Babel excels for static outputs, while interactive animations often warrant manual pipelines. Many work primarily in Emacs; some seek zero-JS, S3-hosted workflows or build tiny static site generators from org files after frustrations with Hugo/Jekyll—sometimes adding dynamic code execution later. Also voiced: it’s fine not to blog.

- Comment pulse
    - Org‑babel shines for static outputs → reproducible posts; publishing infrequently reduces automation’s payoff — counterpoint: frequent bloggers gain more from automation.
    - Emacs‑centric writing works → one editor covers code, email, HTML; flaky chat integrations (e.g., Teams) push users to browser fallbacks.
    - Roll your own static generator → full control, fewer hacks than Hugo/Jekyll; converts org files cleanly, with optional dynamic code execution.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Use org‑babel for deterministic, reproducible posts; offload interactive pieces to separate demos or videos.
    - Impact: More literate‑programming blogs; growth of tiny SSGs tailored to org files.
    - Watch next: Tooling to export org‑babel to portable, no‑JS embeds; simple S3 publish scripts; reproducibility guidelines.
