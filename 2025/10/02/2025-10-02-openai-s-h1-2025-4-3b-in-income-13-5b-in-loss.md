# OpenAI's H1 2025: $4.3B in income, $13.5B in loss

- Score: 236 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453586) | Link: https://www.techinasia.com/news/openais-revenue-rises-16-to-4-3b-in-h1-2025

- TL;DR
    - Reported H1 2025 figures: ~$4.3B revenue vs. ~$13.5B loss. Discussion centers on heavy R&D and serving costs, a $2B sales/marketing line, and $2.5B stock comp. Many argue ads/referrals could quickly monetize ChatGPT’s audience; others warn compute costs, Nvidia dependence, and fast-depreciating hardware make losses hard to scale out of. Accounting notes: free usage may sit in S&M; inference in COGS; stock comp is dilution. Sentiment splits between ad-driven optimism and bubble/competition caution.

- Comment pulse
    - Ads/referrals are the clearest path → huge WAU, sponsored answers, checkout; margins proven by Google/Meta — counterpoint: lower trust than Google; possible user backlash.
    - Compute economics are ugly → training/inference costly, fast-depreciating GPUs, Nvidia dependency; DC infra still expensive — counterpoint: hardware advances could drive per-inference costs toward zero.
    - Line items clarified → free usage booked as S&M; inference in COGS; stock comp dilutes but isn’t cash, ~21% of expenses, not 60 percent revenue.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Ads plus referral commerce likely bridge to sustainability; enterprise/API must improve unit economics to reduce reliance on capital cycles.
    - Impact: Aggressive ad rollout reshapes search/assistants; squeezes Google/Bing; raises trust, safety, and labeling requirements for AI-influenced shopping and decisions.
    - Watch next: COGS disclosure, ad product timelines, referral partnerships, H200/B200 benchmarks, and long-term supply deals that tame Nvidia exposure.
