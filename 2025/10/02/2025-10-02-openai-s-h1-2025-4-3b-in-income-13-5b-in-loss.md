# OpenAI's H1 2025: $4.3B in income, $13.5B in loss

- Score: 436 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453586) | Link: https://www.techinasia.com/news/openais-revenue-rises-16-to-4-3b-in-h1-2025

- TL;DR
  - OpenAI posted $4.3B H1’25 revenue but a $13.5B net loss; operating loss $7.8B and $2.5B cash burn. Costs: $6.7B R&D, $2.0B sales/marketing, $2.5B stock comp; over half the net loss stems from remeasuring convertible rights. It shares 20% of revenue with Microsoft, held $17.5B cash by June after new funding, is seeking $30B more, and a tender pegs valuation near $500B. HN debates ads-driven monetization vs trust and Google’s moat, plus costly inference economics and accounting nuances.

- Comment pulse
  - Ads could unlock massive revenue via sponsored answers and checkout; dominance depends on distribution moats—counterpoint: ads erode trust and Google’s ecosystem outmuscles OpenAI.
  - LLM economics: high training and inference costs, fast hardware obsolescence; smaller labs risk dependence on Nvidia and capital cycles; bubbles still obey business fundamentals.
  - S&M includes free usage, enterprise/government sales, partnerships, and lobbying; inference is COGS, training in R&D. Stock comp is non-cash, likely unevenly distributed.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Monetization hinges on ads and enterprise deals; unit margins constrained by inference COGS and platform revenue-sharing.
  - Impact: Pressure to scale revenue without degrading trust; compensation and compute costs force continued fundraising.
  - Watch next: Gross margin disclosures, ad experiments in ChatGPT, enterprise/government contract wins, funding round size/terms, power/compute supply constraints.
