# Two Amazon delivery drones crash into crane in commercial area of Tolleson, AZ

- Score: 214 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45450449) | Link: https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/tolleson/two-amazon-delivery-drones-crash-into-crane-in-commercial-area-of-tolleson

- TL;DR
  - Two Amazon Prime Air drones in Tolleson, AZ struck a crane’s hanging cable while flying back-to-back. No direct injuries, though one person was treated for smoke inhalation. The crashes spotlight limits of detect‑and‑avoid with thin wires, flight-planning near active construction, and whether drones should ever fly under structures. Commenters question Amazon’s BVLOS readiness and FAA oversight; some call for NTSB investigation. Others note public risk from “beta testing.” A video shows package drop working but propwash blowing it into bushes.

- Comment pulse
  - Keep drones away from cranes/cables → Wires are hard to see; aviation norms forbid flying under/near; use altitude buffers/NOTAMs — counterpoint: sensors might mitigate.
  - Back-to-back route duplication implies shared failure mode → “see and avoid” and BVLOS claims require stronger detect-and-avoid and geofencing.
  - Stronger oversight is needed → FAA/NTSB scrutiny questioned; some cite China’s low-altitude ATC/licensing as model; locals shouldn’t bear beta-testing externalities.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Thin-object perception is brittle; operational geofences and altitude minima may be safer than pushing sensing limits.
  - Impact: Amazon likely revises flight planning to avoid construction zones, mandates “never fly under,” and tunes DAA for wires.
  - Watch next: NTSB preliminary, FAA actions on BVLOS waivers, industry benchmarks for wire-detection, and incident-rate transparency across operators.
