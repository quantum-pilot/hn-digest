- Score: 239 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45450449) | Link: https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/tolleson/two-amazon-delivery-drones-crash-into-crane-in-commercial-area-of-tolleson

- TL;DR
  - Two Amazon Prime Air drones collided with a crane cable in Tolleson, AZ; police are investigating. Amazon will resume flights after an internal review, adding enhanced visual inspections for moving obstructions and asserting no tech fault. HN discussion questions cable detection, flying near construction, and whether BVLOS “detect and avoid” approvals are adequate. Multiple drones hitting the same cable suggests planning/monitoring gaps; reports mention no direct injuries, with one person treated for smoke inhalation.

- Comment pulse
  - Cables are effectively invisible → Plan routes to avoid cranes/lines and never fly underneath structures; wires are thin, cranes move, NOTAM coverage is inconsistent.
  - Two drones, same strike → In VMC “see and avoid,” this implies weak detect-and-avoid and monitoring. — counterpoint: Shared route could replicate one planning error.
  - Expect regulatory scrutiny → Amazon cites BVLOS approval; commenters want NTSB involvement; videos show cable impact and delivery issues, undermining safety claims.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Edge-case perception plus ops-rule failure; geofencing construction and no-underfly policies would prevent most wire strikes.
  - Impact: Prime Air may face stricter BVLOS waivers, mandatory local construction data ingestion, and higher insurance and municipal permitting thresholds.
  - Watch next: Independent incident reporting, wire-strike rate per flight-hour, sensor upgrades (stereo, lidar, polarization), and FAA guidance on temporary obstructions.
