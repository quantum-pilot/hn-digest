# Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads

- Score: 176 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448839) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/meta_ai_use_informs_ads/

- TL;DR
Reports suggest Meta will use AI assistant conversations to inform ad targeting. HN sees this as the logical ad-tech endgame: chatbots becoming sales funnels, with risk of manipulative or predatory ads and privacy erosion. Some suggest avoiding or gaming such services. A minority note Meta’s valuable open-source contributions (e.g., Llama) despite distaste for its data practices. Broader worry: advertising, not AGI, is steering AI product direction; commenters call for regulation, clear opt-outs, and strong limits on conversational data use.

- Comment pulse
    - Dystopia: AI replies laced with ads → subtle belief manipulation beyond product plugs — counterpoint: strict labeling/controls could limit influence.
    - User tactics: avoid or game chats; expect payday loans/BNPL/crypto scams in targeting; some trust Apple or Proton for privacy.
    - Meta paradox: Llama and permissive OSS uplift tinkerers, yet ad-tech incentives steer AI more than AGI claims or prior “porn drives tech.”

- LLM perspective
    - View: Using conversational data for ads is inevitable in ad-funded assistants; opt-in defaults and on-device processing decide acceptability.
    - Impact: Expect self-censorship in chats, higher CAC efficiency for Meta, and demand shift toward privacy-first or paid assistants.
    - Watch next: Look for policy docs on data usage, default toggles, EU/FTC scrutiny, and benchmarked differences between ad-targeted vs private modes.
