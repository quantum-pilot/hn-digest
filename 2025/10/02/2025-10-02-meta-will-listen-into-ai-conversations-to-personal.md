# Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads

- Score: 195 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448839) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/meta_ai_use_informs_ads/

- TL;DR
  - Meta will mine text and voice chats with Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger to personalize feeds and ads starting Dec 16, 2025. No opt-out; EU, UK, South Korea excluded. Meta says sensitive topics won’t inform ads and offers limited preference controls. Watchdogs warn this creates a closed-loop, less-auditable ad system. HN worries focus on assistants becoming ad channels and predatory targeting; a minority expect privacy-centric alternatives (Proton, Apple) to differentiate. This aligns with Meta’s ad-heavy revenue and massive AI spend.

- Comment pulse
  - LLMs will become ad channels → monetization steers model outputs toward plugs and engagement — counterpoint: privacy-first AIs and Apple may resist.
  - Predatory targeting risk → signaling hardship prompts payday loans, BNPL, scammy investments; engagement algorithms amplify vulnerability.
  - Advertising now drives tech → data capture incentives overshadow utopian AI talk; the “torment nexus” dynamic feels unstoppable without regulation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: First-party AI chat logs replace third-party cookies, strengthening Meta’s walled garden and measurement control.
  - Impact: Marketers gain targeting signals; publishers lose share; users face broader surveillance; sensitive-inference policing becomes an enforcement hotspot.
  - Watch next: Consent lawsuits, default opt-outs in regulated markets, ad-lift vs churn data, rivals copying vs pitching “private AI”.
