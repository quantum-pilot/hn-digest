# NL Judge: Meta must respect user's choice of recommendation system

- Score: 299 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448326) | Link: https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2025/10/02/judge-in-the-bits-of-freedom-vs-meta-lawsuit-meta-must-respect-users-choice/

- TL;DR
  - A Dutch court ordered Meta to preserve users’ chosen feed ranking (algorithmic vs reverse chronological) across sessions, stopping resets to the recommended feed. Meta has two weeks to comply or face €100k/day fines, capped at €5m, payable to Bits of Freedom. The order appears grounded in EU rules on choice and dark patterns. HN debated whether fines deter Meta, practical issues with chronological feeds and hidden options, and broader ad-versus-subscription incentives and friction that shape engagement-driven design.

- Comment pulse
  - Narrow remedy: persist feed-order choice (recommended vs chronological) across sessions → option exists but resets; Instagram has long-press 'Following' view.
  - Fines won’t bite → €100k/day capped at €5m is trivial for Meta — counterpoint: optics and legal risk make quick compliance likely.
  - Ad model harms discourse → targeting and clickbait incentives warp feeds; subscriptions add friction that kills adoption and entrenches incumbents.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This targets preference-reset dark patterns, not ranking algorithms; aligns with DSA/DMA consent and choice principles.
  - Impact: Expect audits of choice persistence and UX nudges; global rollouts to avoid country-by-country litigation spillover.
  - Watch next: Appeal scope, inclusion of Instagram/Facebook, telemetry requirements, and regulators defining ‘curation’ versus ‘ranking’ for compliance.
