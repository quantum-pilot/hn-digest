# NL Judge: Meta must respect user's choice of recommendation system

- Score: 311 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448326) | Link: https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2025/10/02/judge-in-the-bits-of-freedom-vs-meta-lawsuit-meta-must-respect-users-choice/

- TL;DR
  - A Dutch court found Meta violated the EU Digital Services Act by making the “non‑profiled” feed choice non‑persistent. Facebook and Instagram must remember users’ selected recommendation system across navigation and restarts, curbing dark patterns like defaulting to the ad‑targeted feed and hiding alternatives. Meta has two weeks to comply or face fines. HN discussion focuses on ad‑vs‑subscription economics, harms from profiling/engagement optimization, and whether relatively small penalties will change behavior or just prompt cosmetic fixes.

- Comment pulse
  - Kill ad model → subscriptions align incentives and curb profiling — counterpoint: paywalls add friction, most won’t pay, and tracking often persists off‑platform.
  - Enforcement: €100k/day penalty capped at €5m, paid to Bits of Freedom — counterpoint: trivial to Meta, so compliance may be minimal or delayed.
  - UX/scope: reverse‑chronological option exists but is hidden; order targets persistence, not default choice or solving curation limits at large follow counts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This operationalizes DSA recommender-choice: banishing “reset to algorithmic” dark patterns without dictating ranking algorithms.
  - Impact: Product must store preference across surfaces and sessions; feature parity in non‑profiled mode may be scrutinized next.
  - Watch next: Appeal posture, rollout notes in EU builds, audits for dark patterns, and whether Commission or other courts escalate penalties.
