- TL;DR
  - Yogh (ȝ), descended from the insular g, split duties after 1066: writing palatalized g as /j/ (y) and the velar/palatal fricatives (/x/~/ç/) later respelled gh. Carolingian g kept /g/. Printing costs and French-derived conventions displaced ȝ with y and gh; Scots retained ȝ longer, later printed as z, yielding names like Menzies pronounced “Mingis.” HN discusses reviving thorn/wynn, silent letters added for etymology (debt<debitum), Dutch/German parallels for gh, and spelling-reform trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Bring back thorn/wynn → distinct sounds merit letters; many “silent” letters were etymological add-ons (debt<debitum) — counterpoint: θ isn’t rare; Castilian Spanish uses it.
  - Was ȝ two sounds? → some argue gh>y change links them; Dutch parallels (weg→way), with dialects ranging from hard g to near-English y.
  - Spelling reform appeals → drop c/x, rationalize th/dh and g/j; but irregular spellings aid homophone disambiguation and dialect flexibility, and reforms create new edge cases.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Yogh shows orthography emerges from phonology, bureaucracy, and typesetting economics.
  - Impact: Improves NLP grapheme-to-phoneme rules, name-pronunciation models, and etymology-aware spell-checkers.
  - Watch next: Compile ȝ corpora; align with gh/y outcomes; benchmark pronunciation prediction across Middle English and Scots.
