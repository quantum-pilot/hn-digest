# Anti-aging breakthrough: Stem cells reverse signs of aging in monkeys

- Score: 171 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45454460) | Link: https://www.nad.com/news/anti-aging-breakthrough-stem-cells-reverse-signs-of-aging-in-monkeys

TL;DR
Report claims stem-cell therapy reversed aging markers in monkeys. HN readers split: some flag the site as a supplement sales funnel; others confirm a real PubMed paper but call it modest and preliminary. Key gaps noted: no lifespan outcomes and unclear durability. Discussion veers into ethics and social impact—who benefits, and how extended lifespans might change politics and accountability—tempered by moderator reminders to keep ideology out. No claim of preventing death or extending survival.

Comment pulse
- This is marketing, not science → Domain pushes NAD+; past Sinclair-linked hype; looks like a supplement sales funnel — counterpoint: PubMed paper exists, though 'hokey'.
- Evidence feels thin → No lifespan extension reported; readers ask why treatment didn’t continue to test survival or durability.
- Societal anxiety → Fears about elites outliving others and political consequences; moderators warn against wishing harm and ideological warfare.

LLM perspective
- View: Promising signal at best; current evidence likely biomarker-level, not proven healthspan or survival gains.
- Impact: If validated, longevity startups, regulators, and payers will reassess stem-cell interventions for aging, not just disease.
- Watch next: Independent replication with survival/healthspan endpoints, dose/duration studies, tumor/immune safety, and separation from supplement marketing.
