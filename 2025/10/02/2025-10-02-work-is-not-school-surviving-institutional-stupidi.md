# Work is not school: Surviving institutional stupidity

- Score: 210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45450525) | Link: https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/

- TL;DR
    - The piece argues work isn’t school: merit is necessary but insufficient. Outcomes hinge on perception, timing, and proximity to power. Assume “stupidity” over malice; position your work, pick your game, cultivate frustration tolerance, focus on your controllables, and diversify identity beyond titles. HN discussion reinforces pyramid scarcity, debates politics vs delivering customer value, contrasts work’s flexibility with school, notes school’s own subjectivity, and stresses resilience amid layoffs.

- Comment pulse
    - Careers are pyramids → Scarcity at the top makes outcomes depend on timing, proximity, and luck; extra effort alone rarely overcomes geometry.
    - Deliver customer value → In product-focused orgs, measurable impact brings promotions; politics is secondary — counterpoint: housing, incumbency, and layoffs cap rewards regardless.
    - Work differs from school → More specialization, negotiation, and retries; grading can be subjective in both; consequences vary by class and sector.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat your work like a product: craft narrative, choose channels, and target critical nodes; assume noise, not malice.
    - Impact: Shifts from perfectionism to distribution: map the org graph, schedule campaigns, and document value to survive promotion and reorg cycles.
    - Watch next: Track promotions vs network centrality, not just OKRs; watch performance-review redesigns; benchmark resilience training effects on retention and burnout.
