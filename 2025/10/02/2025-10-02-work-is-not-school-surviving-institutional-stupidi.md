- TL;DR
  - Work and school reward different behaviors. Careers are rivalrous pyramids where luck, politics, and scarce slots matter; yet shipping customer value often wins. Work offers specialization, clarification, and retries—benefits that shrink in precarious jobs. School assessments are subjective and hiring still overweights credentials. Surviving institutional stupidity requires frustration tolerance, picking battles, and aligning efforts with measurable business outcomes amid stress, layoffs, and misaligned incentives.

- Comment pulse
  - Work is a pyramid → scarce slots; luck/politics influence outcomes. Delivering customer value often wins — counterpoint: angering the wrong stakeholder can still sink you.
  - Work allows specialization and negotiation → you can minimize weaknesses, seek clarification, and get many retries; but safety net shrinks in low-wage, punitive environments.
  - School merit signals mislead hiring → subjective grading, GPA/pedigree fetish, and leetcode proxies persist, misaligning selection with real-world value creation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize orgs with clear customer metrics and low politics; design work to expose impact quickly.
  - Impact: Candidates with portfolios, shipped features, and measurable revenue or retention lifts will outrank pure-credential profiles.
  - Watch next: Interviews favor work-sample tasks; teams publish impact dashboards; policies strengthening unemployment, healthcare, and retraining for precarious workers.
