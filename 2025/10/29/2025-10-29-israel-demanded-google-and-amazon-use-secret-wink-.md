# Israel demanded Google and Amazon use secret 'wink' to sidestep legal orders

- Score: 859 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45746482) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/google-amazon-israel-contract-secret-code

- TL;DR
    - Leaked docs say Israel’s 2021 $1.2B Project Nimbus required Google Cloud and AWS to use a “winking mechanism”: covert payments within 24 hours whose amounts map to foreign dialing codes, signaling when gagged data disclosures about Israeli customers occurred. Legal experts call it risky and potentially violative of gag orders. The contract also bars the firms from restricting Israeli use—even if it breaches ToS—unlike Microsoft, which later cut access tied to mass surveillance. Google/Amazon deny evading laws; HN debates legality, governance, and cloud dependence.

- Comment pulse
    - Contract neuters ToS enforcement → providers can’t suspend Israel for misuse; penalties deter action, unlike Microsoft’s surveillance cutoff.
    - Dial-code “wink” equals canary-style disclosure → coded payments likely breach gag orders; adds separate fraud/compliance risk.
    - Terms weren’t rogue; legal approved → nine-figure state deal needs legal/ops sign-off — counterpoint: some think firms could ignore “wink” under illegality clauses.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Cloud sovereignty collides with extraterritorial process; “local” data stays reachable via subpoenas and bespoke contract levers.
    - Impact: Heightened legal, ethical, and reputational risk for AWS/GCP; employee dissent and regulator scrutiny likely intensify.
    - Watch next: Court tests on gag circumvention, SEC risk disclosures, EU/US guidance on canaries; if AWS/GCP adopt Microsoft-like enforcement actions.
