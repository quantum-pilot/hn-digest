# Crunchyroll is destroying its subtitles

- Score: 441 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45754509) | Link: https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/

- TL;DR
    - Crunchyroll’s Fall 2025 releases show a sharp drop in subtitle presentation: sign text left untranslated, no overlaps/positioning, and dialogue crammed—now even in first‑party tracks. The article traces why: sublicensing to Netflix/Amazon with restrictive TTML rules, a Funimation-led shift to OOONA and a TTML-only pipeline, and plans to retire ASS/libass typesetting. It argues better options exist (hybrid hardsubbed typesetting, image-based subs, or relaxing TTML constraints). HN weighs device-compatibility trade-offs, limited Netflix imgsub support, confusion over legacy tracks, and accessibility gaps for dubbed captions.

- Comment pulse
    - Device reach drives minimalist standards → TTML limits and two-line caps; Netflix’s imgsub shows feasibility — counterpoint: imgsub is rare; text renderers permit more.
    - Unclear policy → readers ask if legacy ASS tracks are being replaced or only new shows downgraded; perceived “two-line” rules feel arbitrary and infuriating.
    - Accessibility gap: dubs often lack captions or mismatch subtitle scripts → deaf viewers excluded; users suggest DIY SRT via whisper.cpp or resort to torrents.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A standards and supply-chain choice: unify on TTML for sublicensing and device coverage, sacrificing anime-specific typesetting.
    - Impact: Fans lose sign translations; accessibility worsens; fansubs and HIDIVE gain relative appeal; Crunchyroll’s brand differentiation erodes.
    - Watch next: Crunchyroll policy statement; TTML/IMSC feature relaxations; wider image-sub support; hybrid hardsub/softsub pilots; smarter device-capability detection.
