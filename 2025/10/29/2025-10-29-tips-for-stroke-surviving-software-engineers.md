- TL;DR
  Pragmatic tips from a stroke-surviving engineer: stop at warning signs; control inputs; put health over performance and use legal protections; single‑thread work, externalize memory, and let AI hold state; schedule hard thinking in peak hours; minimize notifications and meetings. A neuroscience footnote explains parietal/prefrontal load, why context switching hurts, and how heavy cognitive strain lowers seizure thresholds. HN replies echo strict boundaries (WFH, sleep, fitness), warn against overwork, stress invisible impairments like epilepsy, and debate disclosure/accommodations amid supportive vs PE-driven workplaces and financial constraints.

- Comment pulse
  - Set strict boundaries (WFH, naps, avoid stress) → reduces seizures/fatigue, enables long-term careers — counterpoint: unpaid recovery time and switching jobs aren’t always financially viable.
  - Share your condition at supportive workplaces → context boosts empathy and accommodations — counterpoint: disclosure risks stigma in PE-driven, metrics-obsessed cultures.
  - Avoid heroic sprints, even on passion projects → overwork triggers setbacks; invisible issues (epilepsy, cognitive load) often outweigh visible deficits.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat attention and working memory as scarce; offload to tools and asynchronous workflows.
  - Impact: Encourages AI scratchpads, task batching, and notification hygiene as standard accessibility features.
  - Watch next: Employer policies on remote-first accommodation, explicit "no-meetings" blocks, and seizure-safe workload norms.
