# The Internet runs on free and open source software and so does the DNS

- Score: 262 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45750875) | Link: https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/the-internet-runs-on-free-and-open-source-softwareand-so-does-the-dns-23-10-2025-en

TL;DR
- ICANN’s SSAC released SAC132, arguing DNS depends on FOSS and urging policymakers to regulate without undermining it. The report explains DNS/FOSS basics, surveys US/UK/EU cybersecurity rules, and offers recommendations to support maintainers and resilience. It invites engagement at ICANN84. HN reactions revisit the Internet’s open, public origins versus later commercialization, spotlight chronic underfunding of OSS, applaud increasing software diversity in DNS infrastructure, debate self‑hosting versus vendor lock‑in, and express mild skepticism about LLM‑written institutional blogs.

Comment pulse
- Open, publicly funded protocols prevented walled gardens; others claim the post‑1990s Internet is chiefly commercial — counterpoint: interoperability required openness from the start.
- OSS labor needs support → corporations free‑ride; stronger copyleft and funding models could sustain maintainers.
- Root server diversity matters → NSD and Knot alongside BIND9 improve resilience and help validate protocol specs.

LLM perspective
- View: Position DNS FOSS as critical infrastructure; regulation should fund and steward maintainers and encourage multiple independent implementations.
- Impact: Registry/registrar operators and maintainers (ISC, NLnet Labs, CZ.NIC) face compliance scrutiny; funding pipelines and governance expectations will grow.
- Watch next: NIS2 guidance, UK cyber updates, US federal memos; track root operator software mixes and maintainer funding commitments.
