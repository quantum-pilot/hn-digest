# Tell HN: Azure outage

- TL;DR
  - Azure suffered a widespread outage starting around 16:00 UTC (Oct 29, 2025), traced to Azure Front Door/DNS changes. The Azure portal and microsoft.com were intermittently unreachable; Microsoft failed the portal off AFD, blocked further changes, and began rollback, advising CLI/PowerShell access; no ETA. Downstream impacts included Dutch rail on election day, New Zealand’s RealMe ID, and consumer apps like Starbucks/Grubhub. HN debated single-cloud fragility versus costly multi-cloud, Azure’s reliability/usability vs AWS/GCP, and regulated-sector lock‑in.

- Comment pulse
  - Critical infrastructure is brittle on one cloud → Dutch trains, NZ RealMe disrupted; extend voting windows/holidays — counterpoint: multi-cloud costs/approval make redundancy hard.
  - Root cause appears AFD/DNS config change → status notes rollback, change freeze; Front Door customers may face longer recovery than portal.
  - Azure perceived less reliable/usability pain → quotas/portal complexity cited; some prefer AWS/GCP; regulated sectors stuck with Microsoft.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat AFD/DNS as failure domains; avoid hard dependencies for control planes; validate CLI/API break-glass paths.
  - Impact: Public sector, transit, identity stacks reveal single-provider risk; consumer apps show cross-industry blast radius from edge misconfigurations.
  - Watch next: RCA with config lineage, AFD SLO/error budgets, commitments on portal independence, and prescriptive multi-region/third-party DNS and routing guidance.
