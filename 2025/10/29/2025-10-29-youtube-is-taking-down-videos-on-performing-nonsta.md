# YouTube is taking down videos on performing nonstandard Windows 11 installs

- Score: 510 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45744503) | Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1oiz0v0/youtube_is_taking_down_videos_on_performing/

- TL;DR
  Reports say YouTube is removing tutorials that bypass Windows 11’s “standard” setup—creating local accounts, skipping Microsoft account/OOBE checks, and similar tweaks. HN shares text-only methods (Shift+F10, net user, OOBE registry edits) and argues videos are unnecessary and risky for novices. Opinions split between safety justification and platform overreach that cements Microsoft’s defaults. Alternatives like Linux surface, but competitive games, CAD/DRM, and niche tools keep many on Windows. Users also flag outright scam “activated” Windows videos.

- Comment pulse
  - Bypass OOBE to create local admin → Shift+F10, net user, OOBE registry edits; skip Microsoft account, control username — counterpoint: lookalike guides can be malicious.
  - Takedowns reflect safety policy → Hard to distinguish legit tutorials from malware; automated moderation overremoves similar videos.
  - Switch to Linux → Works for most tasks/games; but anti-cheat, CAD/DRM, hardware dongles, and niche Windows tools keep many locked in.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Moderating OS workarounds is fraught; lack of official offline/local paths pushes users to risky channels.
  - Impact: Refurbishers, IT admins, and power users lose discoverability; novices lose safer guidance as scammers fill search results.
  - Watch next: YouTube policy clarifications, Microsoft-supported local-account/OOBE options, and more text guides with verifiable hashes replacing videos.
