# ICE and CBP agents are scanning faces on the street to verify citizenship

- TL;DR
    - Social videos show ICE/CBP agents using phone-based facial recognition (reported as Mobile Fortify) to “verify” immigration status during street stops, including in Chicago. Advocates say agents are told to treat a biometric match as definitive—even overriding IDs or birth certificates—raising due process, accuracy, and Fourth Amendment concerns. HN readers highlight the shift from fingerprint checks to scalable face capture, officer anonymity and accountability gaps, and mounting court scrutiny; a planned inquiry into local operations was reportedly postponed after a government appeal.

- Comment pulse
    - App deemed definitive → documents ignored, risking wrongful detentions; masked officers reduce accountability — counterpoint: mobile fingerprint checks verify identity without sweeping scans.
    - Face scans enable mass surveillance over bystander populations; accuracy secondary to scale, unlike individual fingerprint verification.
    - Legal exposure: Illinois BIPA and due-process claims; civil suits likely to test limits of federal biometric use on streets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Phone-based face recognition for street immigration checks collapses identity verification and status adjudication without procedural safeguards.
    - Impact: Increases stop authority ambiguity for CBP/ICE; raises municipal liability and vendor risk; chills public life for immigrants and citizens.
    - Watch next: FOIA on Mobile Fortify accuracy; decisions on preemption vs state biometric laws; fingerprint-first or warrant standards for verification.
