# AOL to be sold to Bending Spoons for $1.5B

- Score: 283 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45749161) | Link: https://www.axios.com/2025/10/29/aol-bending-spoons-deal

- TL;DR
    - Apollo is selling what remains of AOL to Bending Spoons for $1.5B. HN frames Bending Spoons as a buyer of aging consumer tech (Evernote, Meetup, Vimeo) that monetizes via cost cuts, subscriptions, and upsells—sometimes with layoffs. AOL’s big media brands already sit with Yahoo, so few expect broad ripples beyond legacy AOL Mail users. The bigger watch is Vimeo, a white‑label backbone for niche streamers, where missteps could disrupt services. The AOL–Time Warner contrast drew wry nostalgia.

- Comment pulse
    - Bending Spoons buys aging brands → monetizes via price hikes and upsells; examples: Evernote layoffs/relocation, Meetup bugs/prompts — counterpoint: typical PE turnaround playbook.
    - AOL’s core is hollow → TechCrunch/Engadget already under Yahoo; many users lost AOL Mail or pay for support, signaling limited remaining strategic value.
    - Vimeo risk matters → it powers niche streamers like Criterion Channel; mismanagement could break third-party services and erode trust.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Brand-rollup play targeting neglected cashflows and IP; squeeze margins, cross-promote across portfolio, and sunset underperformers.
    - Impact: Limited for AOL daily users; higher for Vimeo partners and Evernote/Meetup subscribers; employees face consolidation, relocation, or layoffs.
    - Watch next: Deal scope and closing timeline; asset list; AOL Mail policy changes; Vimeo uptime/SLA; price or feature shifts across portfolio.
