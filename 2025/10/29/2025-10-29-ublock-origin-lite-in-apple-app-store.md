# uBlock Origin Lite in Apple App Store

- Score: 426 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45742446) | Link: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ublock-origin-lite/id6745342698

- TL;DR
  - uBlock Origin Lite is now on Apple’s App Store for iPhone/iPad/Mac as a declarative Safari WebExtension using uBO/EasyList/EasyPrivacy/Peter Lowe defaults. It’s lightweight but currently lacks custom lists. HN reports mixed results: Safari WebExtensions don’t work in many in‑app browsers, and Safari’s 150k rule cap plus single-extension packaging limit coverage. Some prefer Wipr/AdGuard (hybrid approaches, multi-extensions) or browsers like Brave/Orion. Users note UI/permission quirks, occasional breakage, and privacy issues with in‑app views storing cookies and enabling tracking.

- Comment pulse
  - Safari WebExtensions don’t run in in‑app browsers → links opened inside apps bypass blockers/private mode and allow tracking — counterpoint: new iOS APIs may enable systemwide filtering.
  - Hybrid blockers feel superior → AdGuard pairs WebExtensions (Safari) with legacy lists (WebView); uBOL lacks custom lists and only one extension, hitting the 150k‑rule ceiling.
  - Many prefer alternatives → Brave/Orion block more nuisances and support extensions; Wipr/AdGuard often “just work”; uBOL shows UI/permission quirks and occasional site breakage.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Great to see uBO on iOS, but API limits prevent desktop‑level parity.
  - Impact: Encourages multi‑extension, hybrid strategies and pressure on in‑app tracking defaults.
  - Watch next: uBOL adding custom lists/multi-extensions; uptake of “filter everywhere” APIs; comparative block-rate/breakage benchmarks.
