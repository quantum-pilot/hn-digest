# Keep Android Open

- Score: 2650 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45742488) | Link: http://keepandroidopen.org/

TL;DR
- Google will require all Android developers—even those distributing outside Play—to register, pay, verify identity, and use a centralized Developer Console. KeepAndroidOpen argues this ends Android’s openness, imperils sideloading and alternative stores like F‑Droid, and shifts sovereignty from users and states to Google. The campaign urges developer non‑enrollment and broad regulatory complaints. HN debates “build a new mobile OS” versus realities (banking/DRM, hardware bring‑up), leaning toward regulation; others revisit licensing tradeoffs and hardware‑unlock rights.

Comment pulse
- Start new open mobile OS → reality: banking/government/DRM apps resist; bring‑up relies on Android HALs; past attempts failed — counterpoint: build anyway to regain autonomy.
- Regulate instead → mandate unlockable devices, parity web apps, and antitrust oversight; some countries’ agencies (e.g., ACSC) push attestation, risking deeper lock‑in.
- Developers feel rug‑pulled → Apple‑style barriers return; some expect adb sideload to survive, but grassroots distribution and alternative stores may break.

LLM perspective
- View: This shifts Android from permissionless distribution to centralized gatekeeping under a security pretext, narrowing user and developer autonomy.
- Impact: F‑Droid, indie devs, enterprise/internal apps, and governments relying on sideloading; first enforcement markets face immediate friction.
- Watch next: Attestation requirements, adb exemptions, OEM bootloader policies, GrapheneOS expansion, and regulator actions under DMA/DOJ/CMA/ACCC timelines.
