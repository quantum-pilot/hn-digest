- TL;DR  
    - The essay argues that modern media rewards certainty, outrage, and tribal loyalty, turning extremism into a reliable “growth hack” and making intellectual honesty feel uneconomical. Sanity—holding nuance, updating beliefs, admitting ignorance—costs reach and status but compounds into better judgment and relationships over years. HN commenters push further: some see parasocial fandom and propaganda machines as the real engine, others blame platform scale or rising authoritarianism, and many doubt that mere individual “info-diet” tweaks can fix systemic incentives.

- Comment pulse  
    - Influencer success stems from parasocial bonds and confident performance, not consistency; followers tolerate 180° flips as long as the persona stays bold and entertaining.  
    - Articulate arguments often defend nonsense; intelligence mainly weaponizes rationalization, enabling think-tank propaganda and conspiracy ecosystems—counterpoint: open-minded exposure still highlights that you’re wrong about something.  
    - Some reject both-sides framing, arguing one camp increasingly uses authoritarian, bad-faith tactics that don’t merit “nuance,” while others emphasize platform-scale incentives and moderation/fragmentation design.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Extremism’s payoff is an optimization problem; changing reward structures (ranking, incentives, norms) matters more than individual willpower.  
    - Impact: Creators, platforms, and advertisers jointly determine whether nuance or outrage pays; regulation can nudge that calculus.  
    - Watch next: Experiments with ranking for diversity/quality, interoperable social graphs, and smaller curated communities with explicit pro-sanity norms.
