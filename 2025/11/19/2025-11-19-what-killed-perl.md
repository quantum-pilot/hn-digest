# What Killed Perl?

- Score: 128 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45977900) | Link: https://entropicthoughts.com/what-killed-perl

- TL;DR  
  Perl isn’t dead—CPAN activity is roughly back at dotcom-era levels—but new users largely stopped arriving after ~2011. The article blames a generational shift (Unix admins vs. Windows/Java natives) and the rise of easy package managers making many alternative languages equally accessible. HN commenters strongly disagree that Raku/Perl 6 was minor: they argue its decade-long, backward-incompatible, yet never-ready “successor” announcement drained energy, scared executives, and left a vacuum that Python, Ruby, PHP, JS, and Go filled.

- Comment pulse  
  Perl 6/Raku confusion killed momentum → decade-long “soon” rewrite, no compatibility, execs avoided Perl 5, community energy diverted—counterpoint: Perl 5 codebases could still continue unchanged.  
  Competitors displaced Perl’s niche → Python/Ruby/PH P offered cleaner syntax, batteries included, easy web deployment; Python’s evangelism and Google backing reassured educators and companies.  
  Design and ecosystem limits → sigils, odd lists/OO, awkward args, CGI-era heritage; CPAN’s once-unique advantages eroded as PyPI/NPM/etc. appeared.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Language decline is usually multi-causal: bad roadmap communication plus strong alternatives plus educators shifting their default teaching language.  
  Impact: Perl likely persists in legacy systems and power-user scripts but is unlikely to regain mainstream mindshare against Python/JS/Go.  
  Watch next: Tooling modernisation (Perl “uv”-style workflows), CPAN contribution trends, and whether Raku stabilizes as a distinct, niche “expressive” language.
