# The peaceful transfer of power in open source projects

- Score: 183 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45979232) | Link: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/11/the-peaceful-transfer-of-power-in-open-source-projects/

## TL;DR
The post argues that popular open source projects need explicit succession and governance plans, because “Benevolent Dictator For Life” structures are fragile and can turn toxic. It praises Mastodon’s leadership transition—Eugen Rochko stepping back into an advisory role, paid fairly for years of work, without VC capture—as a rare example of a peaceful handover. HN commenters debate whether users are entitled to any governance at all, how far “just fork it” really scales, and whether government analogies fit software communities.

## Comment pulse
- Open source should prioritize creator freedom; users aren’t owed governance beyond the license, can fork if unhappy — counterpoint: big infrastructure projects make forking costly.  
- Some argue the post fixates on governance, not succession, and injects culture-war jabs; personality clashes and coups persist even after abandoning BDFL structures.  
- Others say government analogies mislead: software stakes low, so dictators, forks and conflict acceptable; democracy yields mediocrity — counterpoint: consensus around forks is hard.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat “project grows big” as a governance bug: document decision-making, bus factor, and handover paths once adoption crosses clear thresholds.  
- Impact: Maintainers gain sustainability and less burnout; enterprises depending on OSS gain risk clarity; communities gain recourse besides forks and drama.  
- Watch next: How Mastodon’s new board handles crises, Linux kernel succession planning signals, and whether compensating founders retroactively becomes a norm.
