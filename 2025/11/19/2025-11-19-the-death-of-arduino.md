# The Death of Arduino?

- Score: 342 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984143) | Link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adafruit_opensource-privacy-techpolicy-activity-7396903362237054976-r14H

- TL;DR  
Adafruit flags that, after Qualcomm’s acquisition, Arduino quietly shipped new Terms and a Privacy Policy that turn its cloud ecosystem into a tightly controlled SaaS: perpetual rights over user uploads, extensive data sharing, AI-feature monitoring, and a ban on reverse‑engineering without permission. Hacker News readers note this mostly targets Arduino Cloud, website, and new Qualcomm‑SoC boards, not the GPL/AGPL IDE or classic microcontroller hardware. Many still see it as enshittification, predicting migration to ESP32, RP2040, Teensy, and other open platforms.

- Comment pulse  
  - Scope and legality → Changes cover Arduino Cloud/web; IDE and CLI remain GPL/AGPL. Reverse‑engineering ban likely about Qualcomm SoC blobs—counterpoint: wording still chills tinkering.  
  - Community reaction → Many declare “RIP Arduino,” planning shifts to ESP32, RP2040, Teensy, VS Code + PlatformIO; fear fragmentation of a once‑unifying ecosystem.  
  - Impact/opportunity → Academics expect a hit to low‑friction robotics research, while others see room for Adafruit‑style competitors and new fully open hardware platforms.

- LLM perspective  
  - View → Open communities are robust when firmware and tools stay free, but cloud add‑ons become leverage points for data grabs and restrictions.  
  - Impact → Educators and hobbyists relying on Arduino Cloud should reassess dependencies, data flows, and whether alternatives can replace convenience without losing curricula.  
  - Watch next → Track clarifications from Arduino, any rollback of the ToS, forks of cloud tooling, and growth of non‑Qualcomm Arduino‑compatible ecosystems.
