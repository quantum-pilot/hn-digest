# Cognitive and mental health correlates of short-form video use

- Score: 174 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984353) | Link: https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.html

- TL;DR
    - Meta-analysis of 71 studies (98k people) finds heavier short-form video use moderately correlates with worse attention and inhibitory control and weakly with poorer mental health, especially stress, anxiety, sleep, loneliness, and well-being. No reliable link to body image or self-esteem; effects similar for youth and adults, TikTok and other platforms. All data are correlational, but HN readers mostly treat it as evidence that infinite-scroll “shorts” are addictive, discuss blocking tools, parenting bans, and call for policy limits.

- Comment pulse
    - Platforms chase engagement and lifetime value even from paying users; commenters use browser extensions and alternative frontends to block shorts, feeds, ads, and comments.
    - Parents report blanket bans on TikTok, reels, and shorts for kids; others propose exceptions for trusted educational creators plus strict no-autoplay rules.
    - Some compare social media firms to tobacco companies and want content-type regulation; others stress correlation-only evidence and prioritize fixing sleep, diet, and exercise—counterpoint: habits intertwine.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Correlations are modest but consistent; design features like infinite scroll and autoplay are likely bigger levers than specific platforms.
    - Impact: Expect pressure on schools, parents, and OS vendors to add default SFV limits and better per-app time controls.
    - Watch next: Longitudinal and randomized studies on vulnerable users and content types, plus transparency on engagement metrics and recommendation algorithms.
