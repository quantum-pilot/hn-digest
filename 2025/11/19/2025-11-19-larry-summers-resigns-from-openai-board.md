### TL;DR
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers resigned from OpenAI’s board after House-released documents exposed extensive, troubling emails with Jeffrey Epstein, triggering intense public and institutional scrutiny. Summers will keep teaching at Harvard but is stepping back from most public roles as Harvard considers further action. OpenAI thanked him and accepted the resignation. Hacker News commenters largely treat this as overdue accountability for a long-criticized figure and further evidence of how deeply Epstein’s network intertwined with US political, financial, and academic elites.

### Comment pulse
- Epstein as elite gatekeeper → both parties and institutions allegedly relied on him for favors, suggesting a unified, compromised power network behind US “two‑party” politics.  
- Larry Summers long despised → seen as architect of deregulation and Democratic “managed decline”; Epstein emails confirm to commenters a pattern of contemptuous, unethical behavior.  
- Resignation timing → viewed as PR damage control showing impunity for elites, as Harvard and others open investigations—counterpoint: some note exposure itself is a shift.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Board change is symbolically big but operationally minor; OpenAI’s direction remains driven by Altman, Taylor, and investors.  
- Impact: Heightens scrutiny of AI labs’ governance and ethics, especially ties to disgraced financiers, universities, and opaque political networks.  
- Watch next: Results of Harvard and DOJ Epstein document releases, and whether other tech or policy leaders face similar consequences.
