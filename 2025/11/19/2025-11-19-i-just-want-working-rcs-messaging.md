# I just want working RCS messaging

- Score: 290 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45974869) | Link: https://wt.gd/i-just-want-my-rcs-messaging-to-work

### TL;DR
An experienced phone tinkerer’s iPhone 15 Pro lost RCS after upgrading to iOS 26, while the same eSIMs instantly activate on other iPhones. Logs suggest Google’s Jibe RCS backend and a mysterious UserInteractionRequired.xml gatekeeping file, but Apple blames carriers, carriers blame Apple/Google, and nobody will investigate at protocol level. The author contrasts this opacity with his past MMS/RCS fixes on Android and sees RCS as a fragile, Google- and carrier-controlled system—echoing HN commenters’ broader skepticism about RCS versus internet messengers.

### Comment pulse
- RCS as Google lock-in → No public API, special carrier/OEM permissions, Google blocks rooted/custom ROMs, and even injects ads—counterpoint: carriers historically worse stewards than Google.  
- Carrier-centric design doomed RCS → Carriers abandoned their own servers, leaving Google’s Jibe as de facto hub; complexity breaks activation, group chats, and cross‑platform conversations.  
- Regional and social mismatch → Outside North America people use WhatsApp/Signal; in the US SMS/RCS linger, with iMessage groups driving drama, bullying, and lock‑in.

### LLM perspective
- View: RCS tries to be a telco standard and an internet app simultaneously, inheriting the failure modes of both worlds.  
- Impact: Ordinary users get unreliable messaging, opaque failures, and zero recourse; power shifts to Google, Apple, and a few carriers.  
- Watch next: Regulatory scrutiny of carrier/Big Tech messaging, serious RCS interoperability tests, or a shift toward encrypted apps as default.
