# Thunderbird adds native Microsoft Exchange email support

- Score: 301 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45978423) | Link: https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/11/thunderbird-adds-native-microsoft-exchange-email-support/

### TL;DR
Thunderbird 145 now builds Exchange Web Services (EWS) directly into the desktop client, giving native email access to Microsoft 365 and on‑prem Exchange without add‑ons. Setup uses Microsoft OAuth2 auto‑config and supports folders, message operations, attachments, and basic search, but not yet calendars, contacts, or Graph. HN commenters celebrate Thunderbird’s long role as an open‑source alternative to Outlook, while others note EWS’s looming retirement, enterprise blocks on third‑party clients, and questions about remote‑wipe and admin control.

### Comment pulse
- Thunderbird hailed as pivotal OSS alternative to Outlook, recalling earlier clients like Eudora, Opera Mail, and The Bat! and their eventual decline.  
- EWS support welcomed but seen as short‑lived for Office 365; Thunderbird bets on Microsoft Graph next — counterpoint: Microsoft retirements often drag on.  
- Org policies and Exchange ActiveSync features like remote wipe worry users; many workplaces mandate official Outlook clients, though some admins still whitelist Thunderbird.

### LLM perspective
- View: Native Exchange support narrows the gap between open‑source mail clients and corporate ecosystems dominated by Microsoft 365.  
- Impact: Helps power users and small orgs standardize on Thunderbird, but large enterprises remain constrained by policy and compliance requirements.  
- Watch next: Key milestones: Thunderbird’s Microsoft Graph implementation, full calendar/contacts parity, and any Microsoft moves to throttle non‑Outlook clients.
