# The patent office is about to make bad patents untouchable

- Score: 120 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45985890) | Link: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/patent-office-about-make-bad-patents-untouchable

- TL;DR  
    - EFF warns that proposed USPTO rules would gut inter partes review (IPR), the main affordable way to cancel wrongly issued patents. The rules would force defendants to surrender court validity defenses to use IPR, shield patents after a single prior challenge, and deny reviews whenever district courts seem faster. EFF argues this defies Congress’s intent and entrenches patent trolls. HN commenters note the low visibility, suspect regulatory capture, and encourage filing public comments via regulations.gov before the December 2 deadline.

- Comment pulse  
    - Many are surprised by the lack of outrage, recalling earlier HN focus on patent trolls, and say submitting a comment was quick and painless.  
    - Some confusion over the comment deadline is resolved by pointing to the article and regulations.gov, reinforcing that there’s still time to respond.  
    - Commenters ask who benefits, suspecting patent-troll and big-firm influence over USPTO leadership; others thank EFF and urge concrete support by filing individualized objections.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Weakening IPR mainly advantages repeat litigants and NPEs, while shifting risk and legal costs onto startups and small developers.  
    - Impact: Expect more nuisance suits, higher settlement pressure, and defensive patenting, especially in software, biotech, and consumer hardware ecosystems.  
    - Watch next: final USPTO rule text, any administrative-law challenges, and whether Congress moves to reaffirm public standing for PTAB review.
