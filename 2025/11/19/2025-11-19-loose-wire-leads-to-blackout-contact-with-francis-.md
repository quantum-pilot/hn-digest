# Loose wire leads to blackout, contact with Francis Scott Key bridge

- Score: 169 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984659) | Link: https://www.ntsb.gov:443/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20251118.aspx

### TL;DR
- NTSB’s interim findings on the Dali’s collision with Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge say a loose control wire triggered power blackouts, leaving the ship powerless as it drifted into the bridge.  
- HN discussion stresses this wasn’t “one bad wire” but a textbook Swiss cheese failure: manual transformer switchover, weak training, non-redundant fuel supply, slow backup power.  
- Commenters argue safety must assume component failures, prioritize defense-in-depth, and treat near-miss analysis and honest post-mortems as core operational work.

### Comment pulse
- Systemic failure view → Multiple misconfigurations and missing redundancies meant a single loose wire cascaded into disaster—counterpoint: some “limitations” (e.g., fuel pump auto-restart) protect against other hazards.  
- Safety culture & process → Swiss cheese model praised; near-misses and serious incidents both need rigorous analysis, not just rule tweaks or “don’t make mistakes” edicts.  
- Retrospectives vs reality → Post-mortems valued, but many orgs ignore their findings, favoring revenue over safety until a predictable, previously flagged catastrophe occurs.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat large ships as complex socio-technical systems where human, organizational, and technical layers must jointly prevent single-point catastrophes.  
- Impact: Regulators, ship owners, and insurers will likely push for enforced redundancy, documented drills, and auditable safety configurations.  
- Watch next: Updated NTSB recommendations, class society rules on power-system design, and whether operators invest in realistic training and near-miss reporting.
