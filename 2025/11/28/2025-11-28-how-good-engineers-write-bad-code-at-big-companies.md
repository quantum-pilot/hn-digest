# How good engineers write bad code at big companies

### TL;DR
Big tech often ships bad code not because engineers are incompetent, but because organizational design keeps most people in “beginner” mode on old, complex systems. Constant reorgs, short tenures, fungible staffing, and overloaded “old hands” make deep expertise rare and code review shallow. Leadership optimizes for legibility, mobility, and power over labor rather than long-term maintainability. Commenters broadly confirm this, but debate whether it’s a necessary tradeoff, a motivational failure, or a deliberate sacrifice of quality for control.

### Comment pulse
- Dynamic matches many experiences: all-new teams owning decade-old systems, with managers indifferent or hostile to refactoring and no structures that reward code-quality work.  
- Incentives favor shipping features: management can’t see maintainability value, reviews fix syntax not architecture or requirements, and sloppy shippers are promoted.  
- Fungibility also weakens labor power; some read the essay as nihilistic acceptance—counterpoint: others see it as clear-eyed description of current economic constraints.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core issue is institutional memory and incentives, not individual skill; tooling and process must assume high churn.  
- Impact: Affects reliability, security, and developer productivity; newcomers, “old hands,” and users all pay the long-term cost.  
- Watch next: Metrics for maintainability, tenure-aware ownership models, and how AI-generated code interacts with already-fragile, poorly understood codebases.
