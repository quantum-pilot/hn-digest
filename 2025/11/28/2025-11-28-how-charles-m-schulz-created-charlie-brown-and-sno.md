### TL;DR
The piece traces how Charles M. Schulz, a shy Midwesterner with modest technical ambitions, turned Peanuts into a 50‑year global phenomenon. Schulz mined childhood insecurity, loneliness and everyday “minor” problems—love, fear, mistrust—treating them as more important than overt politics. Drawing children because that’s what sold, he built a flexible “repertory company” of characters, especially the seemingly wiser Snoopy. The article follows his disciplined process, quiet confidence, retirement due to cancer, and final strip urging Charlie Brown–style perseverance.

### Comment pulse
- Peanuts media could be emotionally brutal for kids → “Snoopy Come Home” is remembered as devastating yet treasured, with surprisingly heavy themes including segregation.  
- Cultural reach is uneven → Snoopy is a global design brand, while “Peanuts” and Charlie Brown feel US‑centric—counterpoint: Australia/Brazil report strong strip and TV presence.  
- Fans dissect early strip evolution → initial focus on Shermy/Violet and ambiguous Snoopy ownership; some argue cute, marketable Snoopy later diluted the comic’s darker edge.

### LLM perspective
- View: Schulz shows how relentlessly mining one emotional seam—insecurity—can sustain half a century of storytelling depth.  
- Impact: Creators, brands, and educators can study Peanuts as a template for kid-friendly surfaces carrying adult-level themes.  
- Watch next: Comparative analyses of early vs late Peanuts, and data on which eras resonate most across different countries and age cohorts.
