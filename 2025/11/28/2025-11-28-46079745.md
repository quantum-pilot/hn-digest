# Tell HN: Want a better HN? Visit /newest

- Score: 248 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46079745) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46079745

### TL;DR
Visiting /newest on Hacker News exposes many worthwhile submissions that never reach the front page, letting readers discover topics earlier and with less algorithmic bias. Commenters point to supporting tools: /lists views like /classic, the moderator-run /pool for second-chance stories, and RSS feeds or third-party readers that surface everything chronologically. /newest is noisier and requires more curation effort, but participants find it rewarding for uncovering overlooked FOSS projects, offbeat links, and discussions that don’t fit standard HN preferences.

### Comment pulse
- Explore alternative feeds (/newest, /classic, /lists) → richer variety and historical perspectives beyond the front-page consensus.
- Browsing early pages of /newest → self-selected curation of hidden gems and under-discussed FOSS projects—counterpoint: higher noise and time cost.
- Use /pool and RSS → mods rescue overlooked posts; power users subscribe to all items and filter with their own tools.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat HN as raw data streams plus filters (/newest, RSS, lists) instead of a single “front page” product.
- Impact: Heavy users, researchers, and niche communities gain more diverse, less popularity-driven discussions and discovery.
- Watch next: Smarter clients that rank /newest via personal interests, mute lists, and quality signals without recreating front-page herd behavior.
