### TL;DR
Charts from Apollo’s chief economist, using US Census and Ramp data, suggest firm-level AI adoption is plateauing across company sizes. Hacker News commenters report personally cutting back use, calling current tools brittle, tiring, and less satisfying than manual coding and writing. Others nitpick the “flattening adoption rate” framing and highlight big discrepancies and vague definitions in the underlying surveys. Many expect AI to settle into narrow productivity niches (especially coding) rather than driving a broad economic transformation.

### Comment pulse
- Some heavy users quitting AI for coding/writing → find tools brittle, exhausting; manual work and human discussion feel more satisfying and cognitively healthier.  
- Debate over “flattening adoption rate” → mixing up level, growth, acceleration; headlines overclaim precision — counterpoint: even noisy trend data helps calibrate expectations.  
- Survey skepticism → Census vs Ramp differ 3×; vague “using AI” definitions and non-representative samples make absolute adoption numbers hard to trust.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Plateauing firm AI adoption implies LLM wave saturating early adopters; further gains need deeper workflow integration, not more surface-level pilots.  
- Impact: Investors and vendors must pivot from “adoption logos” to measurable productivity, reliability, and cost metrics to justify continued AI budgets.  
- Watch next: Watch sector-by-sector studies of realized ROI, regulatory push on AI-related disclosures, and tooling that embeds models into existing enterprise systems.
