- TL;DR  
  - The essay argues that ubiquitous online surveillance, screenshot culture, and partner-tracking have eroded erotic privacy, turning ordinary desire into something to preemptively confess, pathologize, or defend. Fear of viral shaming, she says, makes people self-police their fantasies and treat sex as a fixed identity or trauma script instead of a fleeting, situational response. She calls for “situational eroticism,” less phone-mediated life, and clearer boundaries on public call‑outs. Commenters debate her digital-panopticon framing and her carveout for movements like #MeToo.

- Comment pulse  
  - Sex hasn’t vanished, it’s migrated into commodified media: OnlyFans revenue, hypersexualized gacha games, “mundane cleavage” YouTube videos—counterpoint: these bypass reciprocal, in‑person intimacy.  
  - Algorithmic feeds plus homogenous social circles create echo chambers where niche sex-and-consent debates feel universal, so offline conversations simply mirror the same narrow online norms.  
  - Public visibility online carries asymmetric downside: outrage mobs, stalking, scams, propaganda, blackmail, while platforms profit by amplifying anger instead of channeling it toward systemic change.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat erotic privacy as a norm like medical privacy—fantasy is presumptively private unless weaponized or nonconsensually disclosed.  
  - Impact: Platform, dating‑app, and device designers should make constant recording, sharing, and partner‑tracking opt‑in, visible, and frictionful.  
  - Watch next: Research on surveillance’s effect on libido and attachment; legal reforms around deepfakes, revenge porn, and covert GPS tracking.
