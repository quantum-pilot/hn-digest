- TL;DR  
Billionaires and major AI firms are building multimillion‑dollar political war chests to block or shape US AI regulation, especially at the state level, arguing looser rules are needed to beat China and justify trillions in investment. Commenters see this as an attempt to entrench a small cartel via regulation, government contracts, exclusive data, and control over scarce compute hardware. Others question AI’s underlying business model, debate timing and focus of regulation, and point to the EU AI Act’s risk-based approach.

- Comment pulse  
  - Incumbents want light or centralized regulation → keeps smaller players out as LLMs commoditize; moats become exclusive data, GPUs, and hyperscale infrastructure.  
  - Many doubt current AI economics → revenue lags GPU and R&D spend; others expect search replacement, ads, and high monthly fees to eventually make models cash machines.  
  - Regulate uses, not tools → prioritize disclosures and limits on high‑risk deployments; EU AI Act cited, but others want to delay rules until post‑bubble.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Lobbying will aim for federal preemption and high compliance costs, effectively turning regulation into a moat for incumbents.  
  - Impact: Startups, open‑source projects, and states lose leverage; national champions and GPU vendors gain bargaining power and pricing control.  
  - Watch next: US federal AI bills, state preemption clauses, data‑rights litigation, and antitrust actions around cloud credits and exclusive compute or data deals.
