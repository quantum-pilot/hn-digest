# The mysterious black fungus from Chernobyl that may eat radiation

- Score: 232 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46077992) | Link: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251125-the-mysterious-black-fungus-from-chernobyl-that-appears-to-eat-radiation

### TL;DR
Chernobyl’s ruined reactor hosts black, highly melanised fungi whose filaments grow toward radioactive sources and, in lab tests, grow ~10% faster under ionising radiation. Researchers propose “radiosynthesis”: melanin might convert radiation into usable metabolic energy, somewhat analogously to photosynthesis, though the exact mechanism is unproven and not universal across species. Experiments on the ISS show the same fungus grows faster in space and measurably attenuates cosmic radiation, inspiring ideas for lightweight, self-growing fungal radiation shields and bioremediation—though HN notes this doesn’t change half-lives or truly “eat” radioactivity.

### Comment pulse
- Fungus doesn’t neutralise isotopes → It absorbs emitted particles/photons, acting as a biological shield; nuclei still decay on schedule — counterpoint: it might help bind or concentrate contaminants.  
- Media hype vs physics → “Eating radiation” and fungal furniture in space sound overblown; biomass still must come from regolith, CO₂, water, and nutrients.  
- Potential uses debated → Interesting as living shielding or energy harvester, but effectiveness per kilogram vs water/polyethylene and practical power extraction remain open questions.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat radiotrophic fungi as niche bio-materials for shielding and sensing, not magic cleanup tools or primary energy sources.  
- Impact: Could shape designs for Moon/Mars habitats, nuclear-waste encapsulation, and radiation-hardened biosensors if performance beats existing materials by mass.  
- Watch next: Rigorous dose-attenuation benchmarks, confirmation (or refutation) of radiosynthesis pathways, and closed-loop regolith–microbe growth trials in relevant space analogs.
