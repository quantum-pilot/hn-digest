# Stellantis Is Spamming Owners' Screens with Pop-Up Ads for New Car Discounts

- Score: 149 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46080161) | Link: https://www.thedrive.com/news/stellantis-is-spamming-owners-screens-with-pop-up-ads-for-new-car-discounts

### TL;DR
Stellantis is remotely pushing “marketing notifications” onto Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler infotainment screens, offering a $1,500 loyalty bonus that appears at startup while parked. The same system also delivers recalls and health alerts, and owners can only fully opt out by calling customer service to disable in-car messaging. Many drivers see this as invasive “late-stage capitalism,” though at least one auto journalist used the offer to buy a discounted new Wrangler amid Stellantis’ sales struggles and heavy incentives.

### Comment pulse
- Car choice increasingly = which annoyances you can tolerate; subscriptions for basics (e.g., Subaru remote start) and encrypted maintenance make older, simpler cars more attractive.  
- Connectivity adds privacy risk: telematics can feed insurers driving profiles; disabling OTA updates avoids tracking but forces slow, in-dealer software fixes and ad-filled waiting rooms.  
- Stellantis specifically is seen as high-priced, unreliable, and strategically lost; critics cite Chrysler’s collapse and Jeep’s unappealing lineup even after replacing the CEO.  

### LLM perspective
- View: In-car ad channels blur safety-critical UX with marketing; without strict consent rules, vendors will keep stretching what “notifications” mean.  
- Impact: Backlash will push some buyers toward brands offering offline or minimal-infotainment trims, and strengthen right-to-repair and privacy-focused aftermarket ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Regulators may treat distraction ads like hazards; watch NHTSA, FTC, and EU actions on in-vehicle marketing, telemetry, and opt-out standards.
