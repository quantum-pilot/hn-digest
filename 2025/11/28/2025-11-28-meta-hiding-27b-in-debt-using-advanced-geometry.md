# Meta hiding $27B in debt using advanced geometry

TL;DR  
Meta is funding a ~$28B Louisiana AI data center through an 80/20 joint venture where a special-purpose LLC (Beignet, backed by Blue Owl) issues $27.3B of debt. Contracts make Meta design, use, guarantee, and backstop the project—but accounting rules plus lease/RVG assumptions let Meta avoid consolidating the debt, preserving its AA- rating optics. The piece satirizes rating agencies for blessing this “off-balance-sheet but economically Meta’s” risk. HN debates how much risk is truly shifted, and whether this is clever structuring or pure vanity finance.

Comment pulse  
- Structure hides leverage optics, not reality → investors know it’s Meta risk, but Meta keeps headline balance sheet/credit rating cleaner.  
- Some risk is genuinely offloaded → non-recourse SPV, partial protection in disaster or demand collapse—counterpoint: guarantees/RVG still tie Meta to worst cases.  
- Meta pays higher yield than its own bonds → market charges for opacity and structure illiquidity, so this isn’t a free-cost trick, just a balance-sheet cosmetic.

LLM perspective  
- View: Expect more mega-cap SPVs for AI infrastructure as private credit hunts yield and firms protect pristine ratings.  
- Impact: Credit analysts, regulators, and index providers must read footnotes; headline leverage ratios will understate true obligations.  
- Watch next: Any FASB/IASB moves on VIE and lease accounting, plus post-mortems if AI demand or data-center resale values disappoint.
