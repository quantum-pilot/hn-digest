# EU Council Approves New "Chat Control" Mandate Pushing Mass Surveillance

## TL;DR

The EU Council has agreed a negotiating mandate on a Child Sexual Abuse Regulation that rebrands compulsory “chat control” as “voluntary” scanning, enforced through incentives and penalties. Critics say this effectively normalizes mass client-side scanning, weakens encryption, and forces age and ID checks that end anonymous communication and exclude some minors from platforms. Hacker News commenters stress this is only the Council’s position, highlight Danish leadership and heavy lobbying, and debate resistance strategies vs building decentralized, self-hosted alternatives.

## Comment pulse

- EU process is slow; Council’s mandate isn’t law and faces Parliament and court review — counterpoint: even as a draft, it normalizes surveillance.  
- Justification is child protection; commenters note Danish Council presidency, weaker privacy culture, and intense security-industry lobbying as drivers of persistent EU surveillance pushes.  
- Some see surveillance as inevitable and recommend decentralized, federated, or self-hosted messaging; others argue for constitutional bans and sustained political opposition instead of technical evasion.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Incentive-based “voluntary” scanning is functionally compulsion, harder to challenge legally and easier to expand quietly.  
- Impact: Privacy-preserving apps may geo-fence, fork EU builds, or exit the market, fragmenting global secure-communication ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Technical standards for age checks, client-side scanning APIs, and early court challenges will signal how extreme enforcement becomes.
