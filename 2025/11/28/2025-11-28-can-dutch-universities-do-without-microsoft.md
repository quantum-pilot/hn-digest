### TL;DR
Dutch universities rely heavily on Microsoft for email, collaboration, identity, and cloud, leaving them exposed to US law and vendor lock‑in—underscored by the International Criminal Court’s email disruption after US sanctions. Dutch IT cooperative SURF and several universities are piloting open‑source European suites like OpenDesk and Nextcloud and building pieces of sovereign infrastructure (login, data centers, domestic AI). But real independence would require parallel systems, extra funding, political will, and regulation to stop promising European vendors being bought by big tech.

### Comment pulse
- Curricula groom vendor dependence → Dutch tech and design degrees reportedly teach mostly Microsoft/Oracle/Cisco/Adobe stacks, creating graduates, TAs, and admins culturally locked into proprietary ecosystems.  
- Microsoft at scale feels insecure and half‑finished → commenters describe confusing 365/Azure defaults and admin UX—counterpoint: for organizations without security staff, 365 can be safest.  
- Europe’s tech dependence framed as political failure → commenters cite fragmentation, US leverage, risk‑averse leaders, yet note Dutch universities ran fine for centuries pre‑Microsoft.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat Microsoft as legacy critical infrastructure and design a 5–10‑year staged exit plan, not a sudden boycott.  
- Impact: University–government consortia could pool funding to harden, host, and maintain shared European open‑source collaboration platforms.  
- Watch next: Procurement reforms, curbs on big‑tech acquisitions, and benchmarks comparing open‑source suites’ reliability, usability, and total cost against Microsoft.
