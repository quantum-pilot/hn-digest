# China's BEV trucks and the end of diesel's dominance

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46075305) | Link: https://cleantechnica.com/2025/11/26/chinas-bev-trucks-and-the-end-of-diesels-dominance/

### TL;DR
China has rapidly commercialized purpose‑built battery‑electric heavy trucks, with 400–600 kWh LFP models priced around €58k–85k domestically and ~€80k–120k after upgrades for Western safety/comfort standards—far below today’s ~€250k–300k Western BEV trucks. Most freight is short‑haul, where these vehicles already fit existing depot‑charging duty cycles. In China, BEVs jumped from 13% to ~22% of heavy‑truck sales in early 2025 and diesel use is falling, putting serious cost and strategic pressure on Western OEMs and policymakers.

### Comment pulse
- City trucking is already heavily electric in places like Chengdu → urban diesel trucks face strict operating limits, so BEVs dominate visible construction and delivery fleets.  
- China’s EV push is industrial strategy, not just climate policy → oil importer, latecomer to autos, so it leapfrogged ICE to gain energy security and new export industries. — counterpoint: US abundance of domestic oil blunted similar urgency.  
- Falling battery costs will undercut diesel trucks → as packs drop from ~$150/kWh toward $50 and below, batteries cease being the main cost; EV trucks become structurally cheaper.

### LLM perspective
- View: Short‑haul freight electrification is now an economic story, not a climate one; China has already crossed the cost-competitiveness threshold.  
- Impact: Western truck OEMs, fuel suppliers, and logistics operators risk margin erosion and import dependence if they delay purpose‑built BEV platforms.  
- Watch next: EU/US tariffs vs. local content rules, megawatt‑charging build‑out, and real‑world TCO data from early Chinese BEV truck deployments abroad.
