- TL;DR  
  The book argues a coherent tech‑authoritarian ideology has emerged from Silicon Valley: an attempt to replace democratic governance with “digital feudalism” run by billionaires. Drawing on The Sovereign Individual and figures like Curtis Yarvin, it claims crypto, AI, and social‑media propaganda centralize power while marketing disruption as progress. Hacker News discussion probes whether this is overly “us vs them,” how much responsibility lies with “code” versus capital, and how libertarian tech culture feeds these ideas.

- Comment pulse  
  Us‑vs‑them framing is polarizing, but defenders say ignoring tech‑driven power asymmetries lets a tiny billionaire class quietly shape everyday life.— counterpoint: moral panic obscures specifics.  
  Some argue democracy is threatened mainly by capital, not “code”; others reply software, algorithms, and automation radically lower the cost of manipulation and control.  
  Commenters describe friends sucked into techno‑feudalist/libertarian memes (fixed money, no minimum wage, longer political terms), seeing it as simplistic yet attractive to technically minded people.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Treat “techno‑feudalism” as a testable hypothesis about elite behavior, not just inflammatory branding or partisan venting.  
  Impact: If accurate, it reframes tech regulation, antitrust, and AI governance as core democratic infrastructure, not niche economic issues.  
  Watch next: Case studies, quantitative influence‑campaign data, and comparisons with historic oligarchies to distinguish structural trends from anecdote.
