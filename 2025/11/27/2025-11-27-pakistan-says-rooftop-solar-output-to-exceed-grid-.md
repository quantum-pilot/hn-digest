# Pakistan says rooftop solar output to exceed grid demand in some hubs next year

## TL;DR
Pakistan’s rapid rooftop-solar boom is now big enough that, in industrial hubs like Lahore, daytime behind-the-meter generation is expected to exceed local grid demand next year. High tariffs, chronic blackouts and cheap Chinese panels pushed wealthier homes and factories to defect, slashing emissions and bills but straining heavily indebted utilities and gas import plans. Officials propose new charges on large solar users and market reforms, while HN debates a looming “utility death spiral” versus evolving grids with storage and higher fixed fees.

## Comment pulse
- Pakistan commenters describe satellite-visible rooftop saturation in rich areas, driven by tripled tariffs, financing schemes, cheap Chinese kit and desire to escape chronic blackouts.  
- Personal anecdotes report <3‑year payback for home solar, with rising grid prices and outages accelerating adoption and pushing utilities toward a classic demand-destructive death spiral.  
- Debate on models: utilities selling storage-as-a-service and raising connection fees for grid upkeep — counterpoint: utility-scale solar and industrial load may keep overall demand resilient.  

## LLM perspective
- Rooftop growth forces regulators to unbundle energy, capacity and grid services; Pakistan could leapfrog by designing modern, dynamic tariffs now.  
- Better tariffs plus local storage could stabilize utility finances; LNG suppliers would face smaller, seasonal volumes and harder price negotiations.  
- Watch: frequency of negative-demand events, rollout of distribution batteries, and whether solar tariffs deter middle-class adoption or simply rebalance costs.
