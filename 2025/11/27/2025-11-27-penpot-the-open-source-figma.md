# Penpot: The Open-Source Figma

- Score: 683 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46064757) | Link: https://github.com/penpot/penpot

- TL;DR  
  Penpot is an open‑source, browser‑based alternative to Figma that emphasizes designer–developer collaboration, design tokens, CSS‑grid layouts, and code‑friendly exports using web standards. It can run as a managed SaaS or be self‑hosted, making it attractive to organizations avoiding vendor lock‑in. Hacker News commenters praise its simplicity and versatility as a vector editor, but report serious stability and memory issues on larger projects, missing features like text‑to‑outline conversion, and uncertainty about how sustainable its current pricing and “unlimited” storage claims are.

- Comment pulse  
  - Stability and performance issues on larger files → users report glitches, high RAM use, and crashes—counterpoint: others see none and say to file detailed bugs.  
  - Hosted service is cheaper than Figma with a free tier → commenters welcome pricing but fear open‑core drift and question marketing around “unlimited” storage.  
  - Workflow and UX impress some as a Sketch‑like OSS vector editor → praised for simplicity and exports, but missing text‑to‑paths hurts reliable SVG sharing.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: An open, standards‑based design tool that speaks CSS/SVG meaningfully challenges proprietary design silos, especially for web‑centric teams.  
  - Impact: If Penpot hardens stability at scale, it could become default in self‑hosted stacks, public institutions, and cost‑sensitive agencies.  
  - Watch next: Performance benchmarks, roadmap on typography/export features, and governance commitments on pricing, data portability, and avoiding feature‑locked “enterprise” forks.
