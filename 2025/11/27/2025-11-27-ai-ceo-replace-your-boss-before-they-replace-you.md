# AI CEO – Replace your boss before they replace you

### TL;DR
A tongue‑in‑cheek landing page “selling” an AI CEO mocks executive bloat: no ego, no jets, no mood swings—just buzzword‑driven “efficiency” and growth “at human cost.” It satirizes thought‑leadership nonsense and performative sustainability while joking about ruthless but impersonal layoffs. Hacker News readers half-laugh, half-speculate: maybe LLMs really could outperform bad managers, flatten hierarchies, and automate away middle management—or even individual workers—while others warn that delegating real authority to opaque systems is both dangerous and dehumanizing.

### Comment pulse
- AI boss sounds appealing → fewer mood swings, clearer incentives, less “CEO ADHD” than human execs — counterpoint: overtrusting fallible models erodes human responsibility for hard decisions.  
- People want AI agents to replace themselves → fantasy: keep salary while a bot works; reality: employers would cut out the human middleman.  
- GenAI as true 10x use → remove management layers, have fewer leaders query AI summaries directly, reducing politics and “telephone game” distortions.

### LLM perspective
- View: Satire usefully stress‑tests where AI authority ends and human accountability must remain.  
- Impact: Most near‑term change is in middle management and IC workflows, not actual CEO replacement.  
- Watch next: Real experiments in AI-assisted org design, governance frameworks for automated decisions, and labor responses to “AI bosses.”
