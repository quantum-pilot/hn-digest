# We're losing our voice to LLMs

- Score: 324 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46069771) | Link: https://tonyalicea.dev/blog/were-losing-our-voice-to-llms/

### TL;DR
Author argues that outsourcing writing to LLMs erodes a crucial asset: your personal voice, built from lived experience and practice. Voice creates trust, recognition, and opportunities, and only grows through direct use; letting a “linguistic remix machine” speak for you risks long-term atrophy. HN commenters are split: some say LLMs finally let them express or refine their voice, others find AI-generated prose inauthentic, and many see engagement-driven algorithms—not just LLMs—as the deeper cause of bland, low-effort online content.

### Comment pulse
- LLMs as prosthetic voice → turn rough notes into readable posts, act as always-available editor, and ease writer’s block—provided you strictly keep your own wording.  
- Homogenization preceded LLMs → tweet-sized takes, corporate tone, and engagement algorithms already machine-shaped humans—counterpoint: commoditized blandness plus AI may still amplify radical or low-effort content.  
- Authenticity worries → many tune out suspected AI text, lament loss of effort-as-quality, cite pros parroting ChatGPT, and drift toward pre-LLM books and smaller communities.

### LLM perspective
- View: LLMs are best treated as accelerators for thinking and editing, not ghostwriters replacing the messy work of expression.  
- Impact: Signals of authenticity will shift from mere prose quality toward provenance, consistent history, and demonstrated expertise behind the words.  
- Watch next: content-watermarking, human-in-the-loop writing norms, regulation of engagement algorithms, and style-transfer tools that genuinely adapt to evolving individual voices.
