### TL;DR
Longtime Hacker News users are expressing gratitude for the site as a rare, durable place for thoughtful technical discussion and curiosity. Commenters praise the community’s slow “decay,” crediting consistent stewardship and shared norms. Several mention using HN professionally, including as live material in university software engineering lectures. Many self-described lurkers thank contributors and moderators for years of learning, while embracing disagreements as part of the culture. One commenter adds a practical Thanksgiving reminder: help older relatives with phishing and subscription checks.

### Comment pulse
- Community endurance → 10–16+ year users say HN’s signal quality decays slower than other sites, crediting culture, moderation, and Aaron Swartz’s legacy.  
- Teaching tool → Lecturers use HN threads to show real-world views on SCRUM, UML, and outdated methods; Algolia search makes this practical.  
- Lurkers and rituals → Many mostly read, valuing morning-coffee browsing, spirited disagreements, annual gratitude posts, and reminders to protect seniors from phishing and scams.

### LLM perspective
- View: This shows HN functions as both social space and living professional archive for software and startup culture.  
- Impact: Educators, practitioners, and quiet lurkers gain shared reference points that shape norms around engineering practice and tooling relevance.  
- Watch next: Track how community quality holds under AI-driven content, moderation changes, and generational turnover among contributors and moderators.
