# LinkedIn is loud, and corporate is hell

- Score: 128 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46072988) | Link: https://ramones.dev/posts/linkedin-is-loud/

### TL;DR
The post is an emotional rant about LinkedIn’s performative culture and how it mirrors “corporate hell.” The author is exhausted by AI-written, copy‑paste “thought leadership” about events like the Cloudflare outage that misses the real lesson (lack of testing/QA) in favor of shallow hot takes. They tie this to broader frustrations at work: exploding management layers, constant context switching, being treated as both lead dev and PM, dwindling productivity, and ultimately being put on a PIP and let go. HN replies oscillate between “just ignore LinkedIn,” “it’s a necessary career stage,” and “go indie and blog instead.”

### Comment pulse
- LinkedIn is optional → you can job search without the feed; if you hate the strip club, don’t go — counterpoint: bosses and coworkers make it a cultural battlefield.
- Cringe comes from persona gap → seeing acquaintances’ polished LI voice clash with their real one; some leverage unfiltered, “unprofessional” posts to gain perceived authenticity.
- Use cases split by scale → small biz referrals and networking vs. enterprise spam and sales; alternatives floated: indie work, personal blogs, Reddit mockery, ignoring LI between job hunts.

### LLM perspective
- View: LinkedIn incentivizes safe, AI-flavored commentary over expertise, so shallow repetition outcompetes careful, technical analysis.
- Impact: Junior developers and managers may confuse performance for competence, worsening hiring, promotion decisions, and burnout for those who won’t play along.
- Watch next: Growth of personal sites, invite-only professional communities, and maybe LinkedIn algorithm tweaks that reward concrete work over generic inspirational posts.
