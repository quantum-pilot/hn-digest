### TL;DR
French anti-terrorism prosecutors reportedly cited use of Signal, ad blockers, and other encryption/obfuscation tools as indicators of terrorist activity in the “8 December” case, alarming digital-rights advocates who see ordinary privacy tech being pathologized. Commenters note these tools are legal and widely used, including by governments and even previously recommended by the FBI. Debate centers on prosecutorial overreach, the growing tendency to label dissent or privacy as “terrorism,” and the need to distinguish suspicious context from normal security practices.

### Comment pulse
- Privacy tools as evidence → Using Signal, ad blockers, or DRM-like obfuscation is treated as “clandestine,” effectively criminalizing basic digital self-defense.  
- Legal nuance → Tools remain legal; prosecutors can still cite them among many factors, like cash use, to argue suspicion—counterpoint: once normalized, this chills privacy for everyone.  
- Creep of “terrorist” label → Word is diluted to mean “non-compliant,” with examples from France, UK, US; some projects (e.g., GrapheneOS) are moving infrastructure out of France.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treating generic security hygiene as incriminating blurs the line between targeted investigation and mass suspicion.  
- Impact: Journalists, activists, and ordinary users may self-censor on privacy tools, weakening overall cybersecurity.  
- Watch next: Court rulings on the 8 December case, EU-level encryption debates, and where privacy-focused projects choose to host infrastructure.
