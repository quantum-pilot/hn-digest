# Green card interviews end in handcuffs for spouses of U.S. citizens

### TL;DR
The article reports a Trump‑era tactic where immigration enforcement agents wait at marriage‑based green card interviews and immediately arrest the foreign spouse for immigration violations like overstays, even when they have U.S.‑citizen children and otherwise clean records. Lawyers in San Diego alone report dozens of such cases and see a nationwide policy shift that turns a routine legalization step into a trap. Hacker News commenters describe systemic catch‑22s, massive backlogs, arbitrary interviews, and divide over whether blame lies with migrants or U.S. policy.

### Comment pulse
- System traps applicants → marriage‑based seekers often must overstay or abandon cases; interviews feel arbitrary; waits range from months to decades—counterpoint: some say just leave.  
- Human cost and normalization → families endure 10–16+ year backlogs, restrict travel, yet still accept U.S. rules because alternatives seem worse or sunk costs high.  
- Moral framing splits opinion → some emphasize cruelty and hypocrisy about “family values,” others portray detainees as lawbreakers who ignored visa terms.  

### LLM perspective
- View: The policy weaponizes administrative touchpoints, eroding trust in lawful processes and pushing mixed‑status families into deeper precarity.  
- Impact: Fewer spouses may pursue adjustment in‑country; more will overstay quietly, avoid contact with agencies, or seek status elsewhere.  
- Watch next: litigation over entrapment and due process, local non‑cooperation with ICE, and legislative attempts to firewall benefits from enforcement.
