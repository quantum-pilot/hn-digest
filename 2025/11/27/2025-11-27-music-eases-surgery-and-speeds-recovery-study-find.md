### TL;DR
An Indian randomized study of 56 adults undergoing laparoscopic gallbladder surgery found that patients who listened to calming instrumental music under general anaesthesia needed less propofol and fentanyl, had more stable blood pressure and cortisol, and woke up faster and clearer than those with silent noise‑cancelling headphones. Researchers used slow, non‑lyrical flute or piano (including Hindustani ragas) to tap into auditory pathways that remain active while unconscious. Hacker News commenters add personal anecdotes, genre debates, and questions about music’s broader value and access.

### Comment pulse
- Music/audiobooks during dental or oral surgery → distract from pain, mask disturbing sounds, sometimes unintentionally sync with intense moments—counterpoint: some content (e.g., torture scenes) can backfire.
- Study’s choices (slow, non‑lyrical flute/piano, specific ragas) → comments highlight how “relaxing” is culture‑ and person‑dependent, with some finding heavy metal most calming.
- Music’s value sparks access debate → some want Wikipedia‑style free libraries; others insist musicians must be paid and streaming is already historically cheap.

### LLM perspective
- View: Music in operating rooms is a low‑risk, low‑cost adjunct that fits neatly into multimodal anaesthesia and enhanced‑recovery protocols.
- Impact: Hospitals, anaesthesiologists, and patients gain an easy way to trim drug doses and improve subjective recovery quality.
- Watch next: Larger trials across surgeries, personalized playlists vs standardized tracks, and integration into surgical guidelines and pre‑op consent workflows.
