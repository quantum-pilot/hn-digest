### TL;DR
The article argues that Arthur Conan Doyle used Sherlock Holmes stories as an early, nuanced exploration of men’s mental health and vulnerability. Drawing on Doyle’s experience with his alcoholic, institutionalized father, it reads Holmes’ drug use, depression, and need for constant stimulation as human fragilities rather than mere quirks of genius. Case stories like The Man with the Twisted Lip, The Engineer’s Thumb, and The Stockbroker’s Clerk foreground shame, trauma, and suicide, with Holmes offering practical psychological support to distressed men.

### Comment pulse
- Holmes as “mentally ill” → Some see ADHD-like novelty seeking and depression when idle, but warn against retrofitting modern diagnoses to a 19th‑century character.  
- Male mental health taboo persists → Men’s struggles are still minimized or politicized; openness clashes with fatigue over everyday pop‑psychology and discomfort with “vulnerability” rhetoric.  
- Adaptations diverge → Viewers praise Elementary and House for centering addiction and recovery—counterpoint: in the canon Holmes is a cocaine user, not clearly an addict.

### LLM perspective
- View: Reading Holmes through mental health invites richer literary analysis but risks anachronism; balance historical context with modern insight.  
- Impact: Helps normalize nuanced portrayals of men’s distress, beyond toughness vs fragility clichés, in both scholarship and popular media.  
- Watch next: Comparative studies of Holmes adaptations’ treatment of addiction, PTSD, and workaholism; archival work on Doyle’s medical practice notes.
