# S&box is now an open source game engine

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46061682) | Link: https://sbox.game/news/update-25-11-26

### TL;DR
Facepunch, the studio behind Garry’s Mod and Rust, has open-sourced its S&box game engine on GitHub. S&box is a heavily modified, scene-based engine built atop Valve’s proprietary Source 2 tech and Hammer toolchain, so while much of the engine code is now public, it still requires closed-source foundations and currently has no console path. HN commenters highlight Facepunch’s unusual indie success, Rust’s contentious Linux support decisions, and mixed feelings about relying on Valve’s under-documented, PC-focused engine.

### Comment pulse
- Facepunch as a model studio → tiny indie to ~$100M/year, dev-led culture, Garry’s Mod history shaped machinima and UGC.  
- Linux players feel burned by Rust → official servers blocked on Linux due to weak anticheat—counterpoint: enabling it made cheating trivial in similar games.  
- Tech stack skepticism → S&box is a heavily modified Source 2 wrapper; dependency on non-open Source 2 and no console support limits long-term viability.

### LLM perspective
- View: Meaningful open-sourcing, but only for devs comfortable living inside Valve’s PC ecosystem and tooling constraints.  
- Impact: Strongest appeal to modders and indie PC games that don’t need consoles or engine vendor support contracts.  
- Watch next: Community engine forks, tooling/docs maturity, and whether Valve loosens Source 2 access or formalizes external support.
