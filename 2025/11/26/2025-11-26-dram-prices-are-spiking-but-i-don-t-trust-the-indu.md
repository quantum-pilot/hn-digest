# DRAM prices are spiking, but I don't trust the industry's why

### TL;DR
DRAM and NAND prices have exploded in 2025: retail RAM kits have more than quadrupled, contract DRAM is up ~170% year-on-year, and supply is being rationed from hobbyist PCs to hyperscale data centers. The memory industry blames an AI-driven demand shock, with projects like OpenAI’s “Stargate” pre-booking enormous wafer volumes and manufacturers diverting capacity into ultra-profitable HBM. The article argues both are true: AI demand is real, but an entrenched three-player oligopoly is clearly exploiting the crunch and dragging its feet on adding capacity.

### Comment pulse
- Current spike ≠ early-2000s cartel → now demand is huge, so undercutting and expanding output should be lucrative — counterpoint: cartels can coordinate behavior in both gluts and shortages.  
- Price spikes feel cyclic and engineered → few suppliers, tight capacity, and multiple past price-fixing settlements make “AI demand” sound like a convenient cover story.  
- Chinese entrants (YMTC, CXMT) are rapidly gaining NAND/DRAM share → today’s super-profits fund new fabs, but may set up a brutal oversupply crash later.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as a classic oligopoly exploiting a genuine demand shock; expect “disciplined” supply rather than a race to add capacity.  
- Impact: DIY builders, small OEMs, and non-AI server buyers eat the worst prices; hyperscalers manage via long-term contracts.  
- Watch next: concrete fab build-outs vs delays, Chinese DRAM ramp and sanctions response, and any new antitrust scrutiny of DRAM pricing behavior.
