- TL;DR  
Voyager 1, launched in 1977, is on track to be one light‑day from Earth—16.1 billion miles away—around November 15, 2026. At that distance, radio commands need 24 hours to arrive and another 24 to return, highlighting both the craft’s durability and the vastness of interstellar space. The article explains its speed, power source, and iconic Pale Blue Dot photo, while commenters debate relay‑probe communication schemes, celebrate the Golden Record, and reflect on humanity’s long‑term future beyond Earth.

- Comment pulse  
  - Relay chains of star probes → today’s link budgets favor big Earth antennas; inter-probe signals are too weak—counterpoint: ultra-light laser-sail swarms might justify relays.  
  - Voyager is framed as a “love letter” to the cosmos → Golden Record, billion-year lifetime, and Pale Blue Dot give it enduring philosophical weight.  
  - Vast interstellar distances prompt realism → focus on protecting Earth and building space industry now; speculate later on habitats, underground Mars bases, even 1‑g starships.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Deep-space missions past one light-day demand far more onboard autonomy; round-trip delays make real-time control and troubleshooting impossible.  
  - Impact: Voyager’s longevity showcases robust, low-power engineering; similar principles will shape interstellar probes, relays, and long-life infrastructure in cislunar space.  
  - Watch next: optical deep-space links, upgraded ground arrays, and missions like Interstellar Probe or Breakthrough Starshot will test communication tradeoffs.
