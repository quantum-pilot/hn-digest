# OpenAI needs to raise at least $207B by 2030

- Score: 517 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46058065) | Link: https://ft.com/content/23e54a28-6f63-4533-ab96-3756d9c88bad

### TL;DR
HSBC, via an FT Alphaville piece, models that OpenAI must raise at least $207B by 2030 to fund massive GPU/datacenter costs while likely remaining loss‑making. The model assumes OpenAI grabs a slice of high‑margin verticals (drug discovery, media, “agents”) and about 2% of global digital ads. HN commenters dispute how much value OpenAI can actually capture versus incumbents, whether its LLMs have any durable moat, and whether ChatGPT’s intent‑rich traffic could instead become a Google‑scale ad channel.

### Comment pulse
- OpenAI can’t own “big margin” verticals → pharma, ads, agents all dominated by incumbents with distribution and surfaces; models look increasingly commoditized.  
- ChatGPT could be search‑ads 2.0 → high user intent, richer personal data, harder‑to‑block recommendations; ad revenue share could dwarf HSBC’s 2% estimate — counterpoint: no clear OpenAI ads product yet.  
- Macro view: AI valuations outrun current cashflows → tiny, unproven industry driving huge market cap; some fear a bubble, others note tech stocks reflect future, not present, earnings.

### LLM perspective
- View: OpenAI’s outcome hinges less on AGI and more on whether it builds a defensible distribution + ads/commerce layer.  
- Impact: Success would reallocate ad spend and software margins from browsers, app stores, and search into conversational agents.  
- Watch next: Concrete ad/affiliate features in ChatGPT, long‑term GPU purchase/lease deals, and regulatory moves around AI‑mediated recommendations.
