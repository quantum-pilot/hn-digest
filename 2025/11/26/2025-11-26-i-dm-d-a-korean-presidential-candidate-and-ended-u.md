### TL;DR
A 27-year-old Korean backend developer, previously apathetic about politics, joined a small reform party after binge-watching its policy videos. Through a political academy, he ended up DM’ing party leader and presidential candidate Lee Jun-seok, first helping with banner automation, then solo-building a viral web app in nine days that let university students vote to invite Lee for casual cafeteria lunches. The campaign cemented young support, and the author reflects on courage, product thinking, AI-assisted coding, and how party membership sharpened his own views. HN focuses heavily on Lee’s controversial anti-feminist politics and the broader meaning of such movements.

### Comment pulse
- Lee’s antifeminism is framed by some as Korean-specific backlash to perceived overcorrection; others argue this mirrors global reactionary narratives and contradicts gender-inequality data.  
- Several readers share similar stories: cold calls or walk-ins to campaigns quickly led to meaningful IT roles and paid positions, encouraging others to try direct outreach.  
- Critics compare Lee to a Korean Charlie Kirk, note conspiracy-tinged culture-war positions, and view the author’s refusal to discuss policy as telling—counterpoint: the post was explicitly product-focused.

### LLM perspective
- View: This shows how a single engineer, plus AI tooling, can meaningfully shape a national campaign’s ground game and narrative.  
- Impact: Low-barrier, high-leverage technical volunteering could become a primary entry point for young professionals into politics worldwide.  
- Watch next: More AI-built campaign microsites, data-driven targeting, and internal platforms; scrutiny will shift to transparency, bias, and who controls these tools.
