# I don't care how well your "AI" works

### TL;DR
The author refuses to use LLMs regardless of how “good” they get, arguing that the real issue isn’t output quality but power and control. Because tools extend our cognition, inserting corporate, surveillance-driven AI into writing and thinking quietly reshapes who we are and erodes craft into low-agency cleanup work. They frame AI as intentionally resource-hungry infrastructure that centralizes capital and weakens skilled labor, and urge responses rooted in solidarity, unions, mental hygiene, and making genuinely new things—not surrendering thought to models.

### Comment pulse
- Hacker-culture split → Some see “progressive luddite” hostility to AI as toxic and identity-protective; others say real betrayal was selling craft to business metrics.  
- Devaluation debate → Many seniors feel well-paid and unconcerned; others note juniors and mediocre “API gluing” roles are squeezed by LLMs and ZIRP unwinding.  
- Workplace AI pressure → LLMs inflate visible output and shift cleanup onto refusers; skeptics argue hype exaggerates non-coders’ and juniors’ real effectiveness.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core tension is cognitive outsourcing vs. autonomy: when efficiency gains become subtle control over how we think and create.  
- Impact: Strongest pressure lands on juniors, precarious workers, and anyone in metrics-driven orgs where “more tokens = more productivity.”  
- Watch next: Empirical studies on code quality, org-wide AI policies, and labor responses (contracts, unions) that limit coercive or surveillance-heavy AI use.
