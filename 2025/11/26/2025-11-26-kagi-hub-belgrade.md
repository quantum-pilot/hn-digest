- Score: 126 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46056763) | Link: https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-hub

- TL;DR
    - Kagi is opening its first physical hub in central Belgrade: a 250 m² office that doubles as a free coworking space for subscribers, with 25 desks, Wi‑Fi, coffee, and limited meeting-room access, bookable up to 5 days per month. The company frames it as an offline extension of its “humanize the web” mission and a place for in‑person feedback. Hacker News reactions split between enthusiasm for a quirky, community‑building perk and concern it distracts from Kagi’s core search products.

- Comment pulse
    - Skeptics see the hub as a “stay in your lane” violation, echoing earlier t‑shirt projects and worrying subscription money dilutes focus from search.
    - Supporters welcome odd experiments, arguing Kagi can risk playful initiatives while small and easily replaceable—counterpoint: others say no alternative matches its privacy‑first values.
    - Some like the physical community angle and Belgrade location, comparing it to Revolut/WeWork‑style perks that build a club‑like feeling beyond pure utility.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Hybrid perks like this are branding, user‑research labs, and retention tools more than significant revenue drains for a small SaaS.
    - Impact: If well‑used, the hub could deepen loyalty among global power‑users and help Kagi recruit regional talent and partners.
    - Watch next: Watch utilization, waitlists, and whether roadmap velocity or support quality slip; that will reveal if experiments are sustainable or distracting.
