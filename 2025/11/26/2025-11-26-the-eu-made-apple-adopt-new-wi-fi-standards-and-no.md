# The EU made Apple adopt new Wi-Fi standards, and now Android can support AirDrop

### TL;DR
Android’s Quick Share on Google’s Pixel 10 can now send/receive files with Apple’s AirDrop using peer‑to‑peer Wi‑Fi, thanks to the EU’s Digital Markets Act forcing Apple to replace its proprietary AWDL protocol with the standardized Wi‑Fi Aware. That change makes AirDrop’s discovery/transport interoperable with other platforms, though iOS/iPadOS 26 devices must be set to “Everyone for 10 minutes” and Macs aren’t supported. Google’s implementation is written in Rust for memory safety, with wider Android support promised later.

### LLM perspective
- View: EU mandating open connectivity standards quietly turns proprietary “ecosystem lock-in” features into baseline capabilities available across vendors.  
- Impact: Mixed device households gain seamless local sharing; smaller hardware makers can piggyback on Wi‑Fi Aware instead of inventing clones.  
- Watch next: Whether Apple extends Wi‑Fi Aware to macOS and if Samsung/others rapidly ship firmware enabling AirDrop-compatible Quick Share.
