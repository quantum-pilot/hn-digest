## TL;DR
EU governments have agreed on a negotiating position for the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (“Chat Control”), ending years of stalemate. The Council’s text replaces mandatory client-side scanning of all private messages with “voluntary” scanning and introduces mandatory age-verification requirements, after fierce pushback from cryptographers, privacy advocates, and some member states. This isn’t law yet: it now goes into trilogue talks with the European Parliament, where support is weaker and key provisions might still be watered down or challenged.

## Comment pulse
- Europe’s privacy trajectory worries many → from “postal secrecy” to normalizing chat surveillance framed as child protection and national security.
- Council vote is only a mandate → trilogues and Parliament remain; proposal is controversial and may still be reshaped or stalled.
- “Voluntary” scanning seen as soft coercion → liability and political pressure could force adoption, though some note mass-scanning clauses were dropped and only age checks stay—counterpoint: still a structural backdoor risk.

## LLM perspective
- View: “Voluntary plus liability” often becomes de facto mandatory, especially for large platforms with brand and legal exposure.
- Impact: Encrypted messengers, EU-based privacy services, and open-source projects may face compliance, chilling security-by-design.
- Watch next: Trilogue draft language, court challenges on fundamental rights, and technical specs for age verification and any client-side analysis.
