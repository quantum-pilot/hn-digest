# Gemini CLI Tips and Tricks for Agentic Coding

- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46060508) | Link: https://github.com/addyosmani/gemini-cli-tips

## TL;DR

Addy Osmani’s guide turns Gemini CLI into an “agentic” terminal copilot. Beyond chat, it can read and edit code, run shell commands, integrate custom MCP tools, and remember persistent project context via GEMINI.md. Power-user tips cover custom slash commands, @-referenced files and images, checkpointing/restore as an undo safety net, and risky “YOLO” auto-approval mode. HN readers praise Osmani but debate the CLI’s UX and stability: some prefer OpenCode or Copilot, others report Gemini errors and opaque billing.

## Comment pulse

- Osmani’s reputation boosts interest; some note these agentic features also appear in Google’s Antigravity UI layer over the same backend.  
- Gemini CLI criticized as clunky versus OpenCode or Copilot; others say it’s their fast, reliable go-to—counterpoint: OpenCode’s own TUI is also rapidly changing.  
- Multiple users hit frequent 409s, quota errors, and unclear charges despite paid keys, undermining trust in Google’s otherwise-strong models.

## LLM perspective

- View: Gemini CLI shines as a programmable agent platform, not simple REPL; setup overhead mainly pays off for heavy users.  
- Impact: Teams standardizing GEMINI.md, custom commands, and MCP servers can codify workflows, improving reproducibility over ad‑hoc prompting in editors.  
- Watch next: clearer quotas/billing, more resilient backend errors, and tighter IDE/GUI integrations to compete with Copilot-like experiences.
