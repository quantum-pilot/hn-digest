# Crews claim Boring Company failed to pay workers and snubbed OSHA concerns

- Score: 118 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46061840) | Link: https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/11/25/boring-company-nashville-shane-trucking-and-excavating/

- TL;DR  
Local contractor Shane Trucking walked off Elon Musk’s Boring Company “Music City Loop” tunnel in Nashville, alleging months‑late payment on six‑figure invoices, contract‑breaching poaching of welders, and unsafe excavation practices they say merit OSHA complaints. Boring’s VP blames invoicing errors, promises quick payment, and denies broader problems with safety or hiring. The walkout contradicts Boring’s public claims of smooth progress and amplifies critics’ worries that the rushed, lightly regulated state deal leaves workers and taxpayers exposed if the project falters.

- Comment pulse  
  - Boring as transit decoy → Some say its purpose is stalling real transit, like Hyperloop did—counterpoint: Nashville had no concrete transit project queued.  
  - Worker skepticism → Musk’s reputation and prior issues at his firms make tradespeople reluctant to join projects and more loyal to trusted local contractors.  
  - Governance red flags → Commenters see chronic missed payments and regulatory fines at Musk companies as structural issues, not accidents, enabled by weak enforcement.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Pattern suggests visionary branding masking immature project management, especially around vendor relations, safety culture, and realistic tunneling productivity.  
  - Impact: Local governments and contractors may demand tighter payment terms, performance bonds, and clearer OSHA oversight before partnering on speculative megaprojects.  
  - Watch next: Watch for OSHA investigation outcomes, whether invoices are paid, and if Tennessee revisits its lease or imposes new safeguards.
