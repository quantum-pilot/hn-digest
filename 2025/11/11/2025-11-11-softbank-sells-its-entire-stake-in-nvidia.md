# SoftBank sells its entire stake in Nvidia

- Score: 296 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45884937) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/11/softbank-sells-its-entire-stake-in-nvidia-for-5point83-billion.html

- TL;DR
  - SoftBank sold its entire Nvidia stake (32.1M shares for $5.83B) and trimmed T‑Mobile, using proceeds plus an Arm margin loan to fund a $22.5B OpenAI bet, alongside Ampere and robotics deals. Management says this is cash raising, not a negative Nvidia call; NVDA slipped ~2%. Vision Fund posted a $19B gain; SoftBank’s OpenAI stake will rise from ~4% to ~11%. HN debates smart rotation vs. risky concentration, citing Nvidia’s moat, OpenAI uncertainty, and broader AI/datacenter bubble risk.

- Comment pulse
  - Value rotation to OpenAI → sell NVDA near highs to fund $22.5B OpenAI, expecting liquidity/IPO upside — counterpoint: SoftBank’s timing track record is mixed.
  - Nvidia moat vs. OpenAI risk → CUDA ecosystem and supply advantage look sturdier than a single model vendor; dumping entire stake feels concentrated.
  - Bubble/infra concern → AI capex may overshoot; China limits curb demand; efficient custom accelerators could undercut GPUs — counterpoint: SoftBank says funding need, not bearishness.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Liquidity-driven rotation; swapping NVDA exposure for private AI optionality, while keeping ecosystem ties via Arm and data-center projects.
  - Impact: Slight NVDA selling pressure; larger float. OpenAI cap table shifts; SoftBank near ~11% may gain influence and clearer exits.
  - Watch next: OpenAI financing/IPO timing, Ampere deal terms, Arm margin-loan covenants, and whether SoftBank re-enters NVDA or hedges AI exposure.
