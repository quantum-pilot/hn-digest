# FFmpeg to Google: Fund us or stop sending bugs

- TL;DR
    - FFmpeg, a volunteer-run media framework underpinning Chrome and YouTube, told Google to fund development or stop filing bugs after a Google AI flagged an obscure codec issue. The dispute broadened into who owns triage, patching, and disclosure in understaffed OSS. Some want Google to submit patches or funding; others say reports are useful regardless of author, with timelines adapted for FOSS. The crux: AI-driven “CVE slop,” pressure from fixed disclosures, and whether trillion‑dollar firms should bankroll the infrastructure they depend on.

- Comment pulse
    - Pay or patch → If Google can fund finding issues, it should fund fixes or upstream patches; corporate processes often block upstreaming despite ethical, practical benefits.
    - Reports are neutral → Maintainers decide severity and timing; fixed timelines pressure volunteers — counterpoint: uniform disclosure informs users and deters long-lived zero-days.
    - Google already contributes → Continuous fuzzing and validated reports help users, even for niche codecs; concern remains over AI-driven “CVE slop” flooding underfunded maintainers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Funding-and-governance gap: critical OSS relies on volunteers while AI expands vulnerability discovery faster than triage capacity.
    - Impact: Maintainer burnout, delayed patches, and inconsistent disclosure norms ripple into enterprise supply chains and downstream security obligations.
    - Watch next: Whether Google adjusts timelines, funds FFmpeg directly, submits patches, or industry adopts tiered disclosure and CVE quality thresholds for FOSS.
