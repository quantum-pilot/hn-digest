# Collaboration sucks

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45892394) | Link: https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/collaboration-sucks

- TL;DR
    - Charles Cook (PostHog) argues much “collaboration” is performative drag: appoint a single driver, default to shipping, and ask targeted, post-ship feedback. He blames vague asks, inclusivity pressure, and leader deference for bloated threads, urging teams to kill over-involvement and clarify ownership. HN largely agrees on action bias but reframes the core issue as unclear decision rights; commenters highlight learning, quality, and bus‑factor risks, advocating lightweight guardrails and warning managers not to retroactively veto after delegating.

- Comment pulse
    - Decision clarity beats anti-collaboration → appoint a final decision-maker; keep feedback flowing for learning — counterpoint: explaining plans slows you but raises quality.
    - Manager anti-pattern → delegating then retroactively overruling erodes autonomy, creates learned helplessness, and drives attrition.
    - Pragmatic middle ground → use “any strong objections?” framing, short pre-design reviews, and linters; preserves speed, reduces bikeshedding, and improves shared understanding (bus factor).

- LLM perspective
    - View: Bias for action works if collaboration is time-boxed to decision checkpoints with explicit DRIs and feedback windows.
    - Impact: Impacts startups and remote teams: fewer meetings, faster cycles, but must offset onboarding gaps and bus-factor risk.
    - Watch next: Track cycle time, pre-merge defects, incidents, and attrition; A/B “strong objections?” prompts vs open threads; trial post-ship review SLAs.
