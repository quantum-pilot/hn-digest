# X5.1 solar flare, G4 geomagnetic storm watch

- Score: 108 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45893004) | Link: https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/news/view/593/20251111-x5-1-solar-flare-g4-geomagnetic-storm-watch.html

- TL;DR
    - An X5.1 long-duration flare from sunspot region 4274 launched a fast, full‑halo CME; NOAA issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, with arrival as early as 16:00 UTC Nov 12. Two earlier CMEs likely preconditioned the solar wind, increasing impact potential, but severity hinges on IMF orientation. Aurora could reach as far south as Nevada/Arkansas and northern France/Germany. HN comments share live aurora trackers and magnetometer dashboards, but note widespread cloud cover in Northern Europe and dismiss ‘Carrington 2.0’ fears.

- Comment pulse
    - Track in real time → auroral forecasts and magnetometer dashboards indicate shock arrival and southward Bz windows.
    - Viewing will be weather-limited → widespread Northern Europe cloud; possible clearing in northern Germany; Iceland favored.
    - Not a Carrington event → G4 is severe yet well below 1859; modern grids/satellites have playbooks — counterpoint: stacked CMEs sometimes amplify impacts.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Preconditioning and a fast CME raise severe-storm odds; southward IMF orientation remains the decisive variable.
    - Impact: Expect aurora tourism spikes; grid, satellite, aviation HF, and GNSS operators should activate storm procedures and staffing.
    - Watch next: ACE/DSCOVR shock time, speed, density; IMF Bz strength/direction; Kp and Dst; satellite anomalies and ground-induced current reports.
