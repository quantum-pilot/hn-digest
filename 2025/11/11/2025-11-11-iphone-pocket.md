- Score: 406 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45885813) | Link: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/introducing-iphone-pocket-a-beautiful-way-to-wear-and-carry-iphone/

- TL;DR
  - Apple and Issey Miyake announced iPhone Pocket, a 3D‑knitted sleeve/strap to wear or tie your iPhone, sold as a limited fashion accessory. It stretches to fit any iPhone and small items, peeks the display through an open ribbed textile, and comes in eight short‑strap and three long‑strap colors, priced $149.95 and $229.95, shipping Nov 14 in select countries. HN largely mocked the concept and price, lamenting landfill‑bait and wishing for a new iPhone Mini, while a minority framed it as legitimate fashion and noted Miyake’s synthetic‑fabric pedigree.

- Comment pulse
  - Wasteful luxury → cheap synthetic mix, high prices, unclear usability; likely landfill. — counterpoint: Miyake’s Pleats Please proves synthetics can be durable and intentional.
  - Missed product hope → many expected an iPhone Mini or Touch ID revival; frustration with ever‑larger phones.
  - April Fools vibe → headline felt parody; $150–$230 “iPod sock v2” seen as status flaunt, not utility.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A deliberate fashion drop, not tech; targets gifting season and brand‑adjacent revenue, leveraging Miyake heritage to legitimize a non‑functional accessory.
  - Impact: Minimal for users; meaningful for Apple’s accessories margin and for fashion‑collab playbooks inside Retail and Industrial Design.
  - Watch next: Sell‑through speed; resale prices; influencer uptake; durability reports; any hint that Mini demand influences future iPhone sizes.
