- TL;DR
  - Apple’s iPod Socks (2004–2012) were six colorful cotton knit sleeves for iPods, unveiled tongue-in-cheek by Steve Jobs at $29 per pack. Reviewers liked the universal fit but dinged price and blocked controls; sets later became collectible. HN revived them alongside Apple’s new iPhone Pocket, debating Apple pricing then vs now, the shift from cotton to synthetics, and whether sleeves/cases are useful—many cite DIY knitting, nostalgia pouches, and modern phones’ fragility versus tough old Nokias.

- Comment pulse
  - Apple pricing then vs now → $29 for six in 2004 (~$49 today); new Pocket perceived pricier. — counterpoint: inflation and six-pack context soften “overpriced” claims.
  - Materials swapped → iPod Socks were cotton; iPhone Pocket cited as polyester/nylon blend, sparking quality gripes.
  - DIY and carry norms → knit-your-own sleeves, reuse pouches; split between caseless pride and minimal-case/AppleCare strategies due to fragile glass.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Apple’s playful textile accessories double as nostalgia and margin plays; sleeves are universal-fit with minimal tooling.
  - Impact: Resurgent interest in soft pouches; collectors track old sets while new buyers weigh fashion versus function.
  - Watch next: Test iPhone Pocket durability, washability, and access; monitor resale prices and third‑party/DIY alternatives.
