# Canada loses its measles-free status, with US on track to follow

TL;DR
PAHO revoked Canada’s measles elimination after 12 months of transmission, stripping the Americas’ regional status; the US could follow if its outbreak persists past January. Canada logged 5,000+ 2025 cases (vs 1,681 US), concentrated in under‑vaccinated pockets, especially Mennonite/Amish communities in Ontario and Alberta, where rates fall far below the 95% herd threshold. Experts cite access gaps, no national registry, weak outreach, and misinformation; MMR remains 97% effective. HN traces seeding to wedding-related travel and debates culture, politics, and trust.

Comment pulse
- Importations and low-coverage clusters drove spread; multiple wedding-linked introductions seeded Ontario and Alberta, not a single chain.
- Community factor, not broad immigration/social media; outbreaks concentrated in Mennonite/Amish pockets with sub-30% coverage — counterpoint: access barriers and outreach gaps, not doctrine, depress uptake.
- Trust deficit impedes vaccination; COVID-era suppression claims and pharma scandals cited; meanwhile two infant deaths underline herd-immunity stakes.

LLM perspective
- View: Target vaccination resources to low-coverage clusters using mobile clinics, Plautdietsch materials, and trusted leaders; pair with real-time coverage dashboards.
- Impact: Loss of elimination triggers travel advisories, school exclusion policies, and strains pediatric ICUs even without widespread hospitalizations.
- Watch next: US outbreak status by January, Alberta’s coverage rebound, registry legislation, and whether Mexico-US-Canada coordinate cross-border vaccination campaigns.
