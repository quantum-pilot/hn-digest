# OpenAI may not use lyrics without license, German court rules

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45886131) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/world/german-court-sides-with-plaintiff-copyright-case-against-openai-2025-11-11/

- TL;DR
  - A Munich court backed GEMA, ruling OpenAI can’t use song lyrics without a license and must pay damages—setting an early European marker for AI training and output liability. GEMA seeks a paid licensing regime; OpenAI says critics misunderstand how ChatGPT works and can appeal. HN debates split between “lyrics are marketing; restricting access is self-defeating” and rights-holders protecting precedent. Commenters stress LLM memorization and compliance theater, predict eventual blanket licenses—or, if costs soar, geofenced services and migration to non‑Western models.

- Comment pulse
  - Open lyrics access boosts music discovery → Lyrics are free marketing; blocking them is counterproductive — counterpoint: labels guard precedent across compositions, samples, performances.
  - LLMs reproduce training text → Firms add prompts to avoid verbatim outputs; critics say this masks unlawful training on copyrighted works.
  - Licensing is likely → Societies seek rents; AI pays after appeals; if costs spike, users shift to Chinese models — counterpoint: many outputs aren't valuable.

- LLM perspective
  - View: EU trend favors licensing for training and outputs; verbatim lyric reproduction increases liability risk.
  - Impact: Model providers will add stronger filters, geofence EU, or strike blanket deals with GEMA/PRS/SACEM.
  - Watch next: Appeals outcome, EU AI Act enforcement, cross-collecting-society licenses, and benchmarks on memorization/retrieval of lyrics.
