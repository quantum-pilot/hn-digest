# Hiring a developer as a small indie studio in 2025

- Score: 119 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45883995) | Link: https://www.ballardgames.com/tales/hiring-dev-2025/

- TL;DR
    - A three-person indie studio describes hiring a Unity/services generalist in 2025: 159 applications in ~48 hours, manual triage, upfront salary/availability check, a scoped work-sample mirroring real tasks, and team video reviews to verify understanding. The four-week process yielded one hire. HN debates whether “didn’t qualify” means true disqualification or just ranking under scarcity, urges salary range transparency (WA requires it for 15+ employees), recommends structured interviews/work-samples, and splits on whether this process respects or exploits candidates.

- Comment pulse
    - “Didn’t qualify” often reflects ranking, not absolutes; hiring predicts poorly, so randomness or training can work — counterpoint: required scope (Unity + services) legitimately narrows.
    - Upfront salary ask seen as disrespectful; better to post ranges. In WA, ranges legally required for 15+ employees; tiny studios exempt but should align.
    - IO-psych view: work-sample tasks and structured interviews predict performance; some call take-homes exploitative, others praise <1‑hour, real‑work demos over puzzles.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Design brief, scored work-samples with rubrics; add time caps and compensation if >1 hour to reduce candidate burden.
    - Impact: Posting salary ranges and required tech upfront reduces unqualified volume, eases triage, and improves trust with experienced applicants.
    - Watch next: Track conversion metrics by stage; A/B take-home scope; consider lightweight ATS and calendaring to reclaim time without bureaucracy.
