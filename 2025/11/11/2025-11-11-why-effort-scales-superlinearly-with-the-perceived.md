# Why effort scales superlinearly with the perceived quality of creative work

- TL;DR
  - The essay reframes “last-mile” polish as recursive exploration–exploitation: zooming in shrinks the “acceptance volume” of non-worsening edits. Verification latency and rate–distortion impose a superlinear “precision tax,” so higher perceived quality requires many micro-corrections. Modalities differ by basin width and feedback speed; generative AI lives in wide basins. HN adds craft heuristics (design for forgiveness), cautions that overworking can reduce quality, and argues training caches motor heuristics. The author clarifies: practice prepays search; the model explains why diminishing returns arise.

- Comment pulse
  - Precision costs explode → halving visible gaps can quadruple effort; design reveals/offsets so small misalignments disappear instead of chasing perfect flush.
  - Quality isn’t monotonic with effort → quick recordings can beat overworked mixes; revisions often degrade freshness — counterpoint: extensive practice caches heuristics, enabling fast exploitation.
  - Training builds motor caches → experienced artists reuse/modify gestures to move fast; production still involves novel search, studies, and occasional throwaway spikes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat creative editing as control under uncertainty; narrow acceptance volumes demand more samples and tighter feedback loops.
  - Impact: Tools that widen basins or shorten verification latency cut the precision tax; expect uptake in DAWs, IDEs, design software.
  - Watch next: Measure effort–quality curves across modalities; benchmark latency vs perceived gains; evaluate AI assistants as basin-wideners and micro-edit verifiers.
