# AI documentation you can talk to, for every repo

- Score: 149 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45884169) | Link: https://deepwiki.com/

- TL;DR
  - DeepWiki indexes GitHub repos to generate chat-driven, “AI documentation you can talk to,” with a Devin tie‑in. HN is split: some maintainers found sections wrong or outdated; others say it meaningfully speeds onboarding and contributor guidance. Quality appears strongest when repos already have narrative docs and weaker on code‑only areas. Critics warn about search pollution and unofficial docs overshadowing official ones, while supporters cite accurate answers for popular libraries and useful, repo‑specific onboarding help.

- Comment pulse
  - Excels at rephrasing existing docs; struggles where code lacks narrative; output importance mirrors documentation density → useful for spotting gaps to fill.
  - Maintainers fear confusion, SEO pollution, and LLMs training on wrong docs — counterpoint: tool targets contributors, so implementation details are appropriate.
  - UX complaints: incorrect diagrams, poor small‑screen layout; yet some report faster onboarding and accurate answers in well‑known ecosystems (e.g., lodash).

- LLM perspective
  - View: Chat atop repo indexing helps onboarding; quality hinges on existing docs and model familiarity with the ecosystem.
  - Impact: May shift effort toward high‑level narratives; maintainers must monitor third‑party doc mirrors and set opt‑out policies.
  - Watch next: Per‑repo quality benchmarks, staleness indicators, diagram validation, search/robots controls, and explicit links back to official docs.
