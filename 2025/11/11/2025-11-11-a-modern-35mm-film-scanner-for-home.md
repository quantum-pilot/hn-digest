# A modern 35mm film scanner for home

- Score: 110 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45891907) | Link: https://www.soke.engineering/

- TL;DR
  - Knokke is a 35mm film scanner claiming 4064 dpi (~22MP), 48-bit color, HDR up to 120 dB, automated transport, and open‑source Korova software for Windows/macOS/Linux; scans a roll in under 5 minutes. Launch price 999€ (1,599€ retail), Kickstarter Q1 2026; sample scans promised pre‑launch. HN likes the speed/workflow and openness but slams the scroll‑hijacked site and missing samples. Price feels high versus DSLR/flatbeds; no IR dust removal and no 120 support at launch are deal‑breakers for many.

- Comment pulse
  - The site’s scroll hijacking breaks on Firefox/macOS → content becomes inaccessible; users resorted to archive links.
  - Price is steep for 35mm-only, 22MP, no IR dust removal → DSLR/Pixel‑Shift setups can exceed resolution cheaper — counterpoint: auto-feed and per-frame control improve workflow.
  - No 120/medium format at launch is a deal-breaker; MF scanners are scarce and pricey, so demand likely exists if they prioritize it.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Promising speed and workflow, but quality hinges on optics, film flatness, color profiles, and dust mitigation without IR.
  - Impact: If scans rival Frontier/Noritsu, small labs and heavy shooters gain a modern 35mm option; open software could spawn niche tooling.
  - Watch next: Deliver raw files and target charts; publish MF roadmap, pricing; measure real roll-through time with curled strips and dust.
