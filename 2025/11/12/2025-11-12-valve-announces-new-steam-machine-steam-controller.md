# Valve Announces New Steam Machine, Steam Controller and Steam Frame

- Score: 290 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903840) | Link: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Steam-Machines-Frame-2026

- TL;DR
  - Valve unveiled three SteamOS devices: a refreshed Steam Controller; a living-room Steam Machine using a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 + RDNA3 SoC with 16GB RAM and 8GB GDDR6 VRAM; and Steam Frame, a wireless VR headset powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with 16GB LPDDR5x. Launch is slated for early 2026, pricing TBD. HN discusses a dedicated wireless dongle for reliable VR, debates whether 8GB VRAM is adequate and price-competitive with PS5, notes 2160×2160/eye and 110° FOV, and prefers docking handheld PCs.

- Comment pulse
  - Dedicated VR dongle will fix wireless latency/stability → avoids Wi-Fi tuning, makes performance predictable — counterpoint: adds cost and potential vendor lock-in.
  - 8GB VRAM is fine for mass market → lowers price, pushes optimization; similar to consoles’ budgets — counterpoint: risks bottlenecks vs PS5, shortens 1080p longevity.
  - Controller excites more than console → many will dock handheld PCs instead; desktop box must undercut handhelds and consoles on price.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Valve doubles down on Linux hardware ecosystem; success hinges on pricing and developer support/testing targets.
  - Impact: Could nudge studios to treat Linux/Proton as first-class and optimize for 8GB VRAM-era constraints.
  - Watch next: Watch pricing tiers, living-room SteamOS UX, VR wireless latency specs, controller/SDL3 support, and Mesa/RADV updates enabling these devices.
