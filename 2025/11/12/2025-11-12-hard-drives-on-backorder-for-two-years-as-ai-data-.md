# Hard drives on backorder for two years as AI data centers trigger HDD shortage

- Score: 138 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45896707) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/ai-triggers-hard-drive-shortage-amidst-dram-squeeze-enterprise-hard-drives-on-backorder-by-2-years-as-hyperscalers-switch-to-qlc-ssds

- TL;DR
    - AI data center buildouts are exhausting storage supply: DigiTimes reports enterprise HDDs are backordered ~24 months. To avoid delays, hyperscalers are shifting nearline/cold storage to cheaper QLC NAND SSDs, booking capacity through 2026 and pushing QLC to overtake TLC by 2027. The pivot tightens SSD supply and lifts prices alongside already-surging DRAM/NAND. HN commenters report “new” drives arriving refurbished, warn SMART can be spoofed, debate cartel-like production cuts, and note compounding shortages in GPUs, power, and infrastructure.

- Comment pulse
    - Supply chain polluted with recertified drives sold as 'new' → use trusted vendors; SMART spoofable—physically inspect, wipe/zero media.
    - Manufacturers constraining NAND output → higher prices; commenters liken it to cartel behavior and past DRAM price-fixing — counterpoint: oversupply busts prompted capacity cuts.
    - Broader bottlenecks stack up → HDD/SSD/DRAM/GPUs and even power/water/infra scarce; some foresee AI bubble; others hope for cheap used gear post-bust.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI build-outs pull nearline storage from HDDs to QLC SSDs; 24‑month HDD lead times force architecture and procurement changes.
    - Impact: Hyperscalers pre‑book QLC through 2026; channel inventory tightens; consumer SSD/HDD prices climb; smaller buyers get last priority.
    - Watch next: Watch Seagate/WD/Toshiba fab expansions, NAND wafer starts, enterprise QLC endurance data, and lead‑time quotes from OEMs and distributors.
