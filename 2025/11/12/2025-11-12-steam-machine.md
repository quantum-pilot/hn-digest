# Steam Machine

- Score: 1210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903404) | Link: https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine

- TL;DR
  - Valve’s Steam Machine returns as a Linux PC-console running SteamOS, alongside a refreshed Steam Controller and the ARM-based Steam Frame VR headset. Theme: openness—install any apps or even another OS. Proton gains ARM support via FEX for the headset; the Steam Machine itself uses AMD Zen 4 x86. Many report Windows-free gaming is now viable (ProtonDB, AMD GPUs, Bazzite/ChimeraOS). Pricing is debated (≤€800 desired) amid costly RAM/SSD. Hype for the headset tempered by “shelfware” fears; preorders and SteamOS release timing unclear.

- Comment pulse
  - Linux gaming now practical → ProtonDB, AMD GPUs, and distros like Bazzite/ChimeraOS let users ditch Windows without losing major titles.
  - ARM support clarity → Proton on aarch64 via FEX powers Steam Frame; Steam Machine uses AMD Zen 4 x86 — counterpoint: mixed messaging caused confusion.
  - Price skepticism → To compete with consoles, target ≤€800; component inflation (RAM/SSD, CPUs) suggests higher MSRP.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Valve is standardizing open Linux gaming across x86 and ARM, bundling hardware to reduce friction.
  - Impact: Publishers and anti-cheat vendors must support Proton on ARM; controller APIs may shift beyond XInput toward SInput/Steam Input.
  - Watch next: Public SteamOS releases (x86/ARM), compatibility lists and benchmarks, headset preorder price, and third-party controller adoption.
