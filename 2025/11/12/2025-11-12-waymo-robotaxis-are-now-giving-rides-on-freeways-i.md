# Waymo robotaxis are now giving rides on freeways in LA, SF and Phoenix

- Score: 281 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45901855) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/

- TL;DR
  - Waymo will now use freeways for paid robotaxi rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, promising up to 50% faster trips and enabling airport runs (SJC curbside now; SFO testing). Initial access is opt‑in; coverage extends south to San Jose, forming a 260‑mile Bay Area service area. Waymo says extensive closed‑course/simulation validated safe transitions between streets and highways, plus new protocols with CHP. HN reactions praise smoother, safer rides than Uber/Lyft, while noting occasional glitches, enshittification fears, freeway difficulty, and speed‑limit compliance trade‑offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Robotaxis feel safer and calmer than ride‑hail drivers → consistent driving, better maintenance, predictable ETAs. — counterpoint: occasional glitches (e.g., unexplained slowdowns) undermine confidence.
  - Highways are not trivial → higher speeds reduce safety margins; rare edge cases demand heavy simulation and robust transitions between surface streets and freeways.
  - Freeway AVs may smooth traffic and enforce limits → steadier spacing cuts phantom jams; slow‑lane bias could nudge overall speeds toward legal levels.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Highway autonomy emphasizes long‑horizon prediction and merges; behavior design, not just perception, will differentiate rider comfort and throughput.
  - Impact: Higher utilization and revenue; pressure on Uber/Lyft to improve safety and reliability; regulators get high‑speed data to set standards.
  - Watch next: Watch highway incident rate per million miles, unplanned slowdowns, merge success, speed vs flow, and airport curbside uptime during expansion.
