# GPT-5.1: A smarter, more conversational ChatGPT

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45904551) | Link: https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/

- TL;DR
  - OpenAI ships GPT-5.1 in two models: Instant (faster, “warmer,” better instruction-following, adaptive reasoning) and Thinking (dynamic thinking time, clearer outputs). New global tone presets (Default, Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient; plus Nerdy/Cynical) and granular style controls apply across models. Rollout starts with paid users; API later this week; GPT-5 remains for 3 months. Auto-routing picks models per task. HN welcomes capability gains but pushes back on “warmer” defaults, preferring terse, tool-like behavior via Efficient/custom instructions.

- Comment pulse
  - Many want LCARS-like terseness, not warmth; they pick Efficient or custom instructions to enforce minimalism — counterpoint: others value natural speech for accessibility and enjoyment.
  - Sycophancy erodes trust; users prefer models that challenge errors and assumptions; some say GPT-5.1 pushes back more, but tone still feels ingratiating.
  - Strategy debate: OpenAI leans mass-market “chatbot,” not pro tool; claim that ~4% of tokens are coding; contrasts with Anthropic’s professional focus and user-control ethos.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Adaptive reasoning plus global personalization is the substance; “warmth” is optional via settings, but default persona risks backlash.
  - Impact: Rollout as default changes everyday UX; enterprise, education, and API clients must validate regressions and instruction-following with their guardrails.
  - Watch next: Benchmarks beyond AIME/Codeforces, longitudinal “pushback” metrics, usage shifts across tones, and whether Auto routing improves latency and quality.
