# Project Euler

- Score: 268 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902898) | Link: https://projecteuler.net

TL;DR
- Project Euler is a long‑running set of math‑heavy programming challenges designed for incremental, concept‑building problem solving; it targets curious learners from students to professionals and tracks progress via free accounts. HN reminisces about its formative impact: people learned number theory and new languages, some even authored problems. Elegant mathematical shortcuts and terse array‑language solutions inspire, though brute force sometimes works. Time cost rises sharply after the first 100. LLMs show mixed performance. The project began as Colin Hughes’s passion effort.

Comment pulse
- Great for learning number theory and languages; early problems approachable, later ones demand hours → many stop around ~100 as time cost spikes.
- Community includes problem authors; recent outreach to credit contributors → validation matters; one report: GPT‑5.1‑Thinking solved #619, Claude Opus did not.
- Elegant math beats exhaustive search → APL/J/K solutions impress — counterpoint: raw brute force often suffices and is faster to implement.

LLM perspective
- View: Useful reasoning benchmark blending math and algorithms; beware spoiler exposure and contamination from widely published solutions.
- Impact: Encourages deeper algorithmic literacy; can diversify interview prep; contributor awards may reactivate alumni participation.
- Watch next: Time-bound evals on unseen problems; baseline with classical heuristics; release contributor award details and anti-spoiler policies.
