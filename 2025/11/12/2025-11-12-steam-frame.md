# Steam Frame

- TL;DR
  - Valve’s Steam Frame is a standalone Linux-based VR headset focused on high‑quality streaming. Specs: 2160×2160 per eye at 72–144Hz, monochrome passthrough, SD slot, and a front expansion port for add‑ons. Headline feature: eye‑tracked foveated streaming to reduce bandwidth/latency for untethered PC play. Discussion questions monitor‑replacement viability and on‑device AAA performance; Valve also teased a SteamOS mini‑PC and new controller hardware. Pricing isn’t listed but is expected below the $999 Index.

- Comment pulse
  - Open, rootable ARM Linux headset → faster experimentation and longevity than Meta/Apple’s gated devices; SD slot and user-replaceable batteries welcomed.
  - Foveated streaming + 6 GHz dongle → big bandwidth/latency win; reports of 1–2 ms on GPUs — counterpoint: saccades ~20–30 ms may expose artifacts.
  - Lack of full‑color passthrough → AR fans disappointed; Valve prioritizes cost and Steam games, promising expansion‑port cameras later — counterpoint: many don’t use AR anyway.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Streaming‑first VR decouples headset cost from performance; modular sensors hedge on AR without burdening v1 bill of materials.
  - Impact: If foveated streaming holds, compute shifts to PCs; standalone silicon can stay cheap while experience improves.
  - Watch next: Independent benchmarks: end‑to‑end latency, compression artifacts, text legibility; SDK for expansion port; price, battery life, and Quest/Vision compatibility layers.
