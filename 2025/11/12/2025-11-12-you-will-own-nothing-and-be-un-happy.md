# You will own nothing and be (un)happy

- Score: 242 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45897016) | Link: https://racc.blog/you-will-own-nothing-and-be-unhappy/

- TL;DR
  - A Goodnotes user decries Goodnotes 6 dropping “lifetime” licenses for subscriptions and bundling non‑optional AI, casting it as part of a wider “own nothing” trend. The post argues subscriptions monetize inertia, reduce control, and favor revenue over quality. HN debate: many say subs degrade products and normalize shipping unfinished work; others note you still own your old version and alternatives exist (FOSS, Bandcamp, physical media). Threads branch into incentives, open‑source exits, and avoiding gadget churn.

- Comment pulse
  - Subscriptions degrade products → steady revenue reduces pressure; live-service norms ship unfinished features while bugs persist — counterpoint: dysfunctions predate subs; misaligned incentives, scale.
  - Lifetime license frustration → Goodnotes 6 ends one-time purchase; upgrades gated by subscription, raising “own nothing” concerns.
  - Alternatives exist → FOSS apps, Bandcamp/physical media, self-hosting reclaim control; some urge gadget restraint for note-taking efficiency.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Subscriptions persist; value shifts to data portability, offline mode, and transparent, optional AI with clear upgrade paths.
  - Impact: Winners—vendors with exportable formats and easy cancellation; Losers—“lifetime” sellers eroding trust, apps bundling mandatory AI.
  - Watch next: Stronger cancellation rules, app-store defaults for AI opt-out, offline-first benchmarks for note apps.
