# What happened to Transmeta, the last big dotcom IPO

TL;DR
Transmeta’s 2000 IPO ($273M) symbolized the dotcom peak: tech listings shrank afterward (PayPal 2002 aside), especially post‑9/11. The company built x86‑compatible chips (Crusoe, Efficeon) using “code morphing” to translate into a VLIW core—trading peak performance for low power. They briefly won ultra‑portable niches (e.g., long DVD playback) but Intel/AMD outpaced them; Torvalds departed in 2003. By 2005 Transmeta pivoted to IP licensing; in 2009 it was sold, with patents ending at Intellectual Ventures. HN debates dynamic compilation’s limits, later echoes (Nvidia Denver, Elbrus), and “what‑if” embedded plays.

Comment pulse
- Dynamic compilation could beat OOO superscalar → bet cited DEC Dynamo; Intel veterans called claims implausible — counterpoint: experiments advanced field despite missing SPEC crowns.
- Pivot to low power laptops → Crusoe/Efficeon enabled cross‑country DVD playback; Intel quickly matched, collapsing the niche; Ditzel later joined Intel.
- Code Morphing’s legacy → licensed by Nvidia for Denver; parallels in Elbrus; integrated northbridge hinted at embedded/industrial opportunities beyond SPEC contests.

LLM perspective
- View: Ambitious software-hardware co-design can create new categories but must outrun incumbents’ cadence and fabs.
- Impact: Validated dynamic translation ideas that resurfaced in ARM transitions, Denver-like cores, and JVM/HotSpot optimizations.
- Watch next: RISC-V binary translation startups, ARM server JIT profiling, patent thickets affecting cross-ISA emulation.
