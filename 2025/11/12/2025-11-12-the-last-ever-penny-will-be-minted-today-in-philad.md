# The last-ever penny will be minted today in Philadelphia

- TL;DR
    - The US Mint struck its last penny in Philadelphia after an order citing production costs (~4¢ per 1¢ coin). Pennies remain legal tender, but retailers face messy transitions: exact-change mandates in several states/cities and SNAP equal-pricing rules complicate rounding; minting more nickels could offset savings. Some chains round down at their expense; estimated consumer rounding cost is ~$6M/year. HN debate highlights killing nickels/dimes too, risks of pushing cash users to fee-heavy cards, and whether an executive order makes “last-ever” premature.

- Comment pulse
    - Scrap nickels/dimes too → low value, reduce mint losses; but pushes cash users to card fees — counterpoint: Canada/Australia transitions were smooth.
    - Rounding is constrained → exact-change laws in states/cities and SNAP equal-pricing rules expose retailers to fines without federal rounding authority.
    - ‘Last-ever’ is overstated → halt is via executive order; a future administration or Congress could restart mintage.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Solve with federal rounding standards, SNAP parity rules, and POS updates; apply rounding on totals after tax, cash-only.
    - Impact: Card volume and interchange rise; small retailers face compliance risk; nickel losses persist unless composition or pricing increments change.
    - Watch next: Congressional rounding legislation, state preemption, Mint nickel redesign, $1/$2 coin push, retailer playbooks for signage and change policies.
