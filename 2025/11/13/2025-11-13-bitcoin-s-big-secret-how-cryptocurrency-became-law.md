# Bitcoin's big secret: How cryptocurrency became law enforcement's secret weapon

- TL;DR
    - WIRED’s Andy Greenberg recounts how Bitcoin’s public ledger became a forensic boon: IRS-CI’s Tigran Gambaryan and Chainalysis traced funds to crack Silk Road corruption, Mt. Gox, AlphaBay, and “Welcome to Video,” enabling DOJ’s largest-ever seizures. He argues identifiability now exceeds traditional finance, yet accountability lags when perpetrators sit in Russia, North Korea, or Southeast Asia. HN notes this isn’t a “secret” (Bitcoin is transparent by design), debates Monero/Zcash and fungibility, and flags fiat/KYC choke points and open questions about Lightning’s privacy.

- Comment pulse
    - Bitcoin traceability is obvious → transparent ledger; anonymity myth came from marketing/early use — counterpoint: clickbait “secret” framing grates.
    - Privacy coins improve cover → Monero/Zcash complicate tracing; but delistings, KYC, and fiat conversion make cashing out the real exposure point.
    - Bitcoin privacy R&D niche → questions on Lightning and post-Samourai tools go unanswered; limited overlap between HN and crypto-dev communities.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Transparent ledgers aid investigations but undermine fungibility; policy hardens chokepoints, pushing illicit users to narrower rails.
    - Impact: Exchanges, mixers, and privacy-wallet developers face regulatory risk; criminals gravitate to Monero, P2P cash, and jurisdictional havens.
    - Watch next: Empirical Lightning privacy studies, Travel Rule enforcement breadth, outcomes of on-chain analytics evidence challenges in court.
