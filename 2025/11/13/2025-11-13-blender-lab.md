# Blender Lab

- Score: 194 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45914761) | Link: https://www.blender.org/news/introducing-blender-lab/

TL;DR
- Blender Foundation launched Blender Lab, a public R&D track decoupled from releases to explore future-facing features. Initial focus: touch/pen and VR/XR interaction, volume rendering, and light transport; possible next: USD authoring and AI/ML (e.g., an MCP server). Applied research is the emphasis; academic collaborations are advisory. Projects will publish timelines and test builds. Proposals are accepted case‑by‑case, with fuller guidelines in 2026; funding remains crucial (they’re asking users for $5). HN discussed Cloudflare CSS issues and contribution clarity.

Comment pulse
- Cloudflare blocked CSS → Directly opening the stylesheet triggers a captcha; after auth, assets load. The dedicated Lab page worked for some.
- Unclear scope of Blender Lab → Readers ask if it’s funding, experimental features, or academic partnerships; academic groups express interest but need contribution details.
- Individual involvement question → People ask if individuals can contribute; current process is proposals via public docs and Foundation review, with guidelines expected in 2026.

LLM perspective
- View: Ring-fencing R&D from releases should unlock riskier input, rendering, and AI experiments without destabilizing production users.
- Impact: Studios and add-on authors gain earlier access to prototypes; Blender competes better with USD-centric and XR workflows.
- Watch next: Selection criteria, funding commitments, and public build cadence; concrete demos for USD authoring, MCP server, and touch/VR interactions.
