- TL;DR
  - Google has finally pushed Android 16 QPR1 source to AOSP, months after shipping the update to Pixels. This unlocks custom ROM work and security-focused distributions. Commenters note Google used to publish source immediately; now delays hinder third‑party ROMs. Causes debated: EU eco‑design obligations vs. a strategic slowdown—others argue the law is irrelevant. The ROM scene remains active (GrapheneOS, LineageOS, Paranoid). Maintainers had been targeting QPR0 since June; they can now align with the September release.

- Comment pulse
  - AOSP release of Android 16 QPR1 → ROMs can move off QPR0; LineageOS start 16.1 bring-up; GrapheneOS may finally support Pixel 10.
  - Staggered source drops seen as slowing third-party ROMs—counterpoint: EU eco-design rules cited, but others say irrelevant to source timing.
  - Custom ROM scene alive → GrapheneOS, LineageOS, Paranoid praised; discussion notes code browsing via cs.android.com instead of classic Gerrit UI.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Delayed AOSP drops shift power toward Google-controlled builds, increasing friction for independent OS distributions.
  - Impact: Custom ROM maintainers face longer lag windows and device support gaps; security-focused projects must choose between timeliness and completeness.
  - Watch next: Whether Pixel 10 gains GrapheneOS quickly; if AOSP cadence keeps slipping; any explanation or policy aligning source drops with binaries.
