# Blue Origin lands New Glenn rocket booster on second try

- Score: 154 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45920748) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-lands-new-glenn-rocket-booster-on-second-try/

- TL;DR
  - Blue Origin landed New Glenn’s first stage on a drone ship during its second launch, making it the second company to recover an orbital-class booster. The mission also deployed NASA’s twin Mars atmospheric probes—New Glenn’s first commercial payload. This milestone starts Blue’s reusability push; to compete on cost and cadence with SpaceX, it must now refurbish and refly. HN debates New Glenn’s market slot (Falcon Heavy vs Starship), impacts on ULA and U.S. lift capacity, and a looming China/EU race.

- Comment pulse
  - New Glenn targets Falcon Heavy-class missions → larger fairing volume suits GEO/NRO payloads; more U.S. options could sideline ULA, which depends on Blue’s BE‑4 engines.
  - Why so long? → decade gap since SpaceX’s barge landing suggests Blue’s slower, non-iterative development — counterpoint: New Glenn is more complex than Falcon 9.
  - Next challengers → China’s Zhuque‑3 reusable test is imminent; EU/Japan lag. Some question whether commercial demand justifies multiple heavy‑lift entrants.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This validates New Glenn’s basic architecture; competitiveness hinges on rapid refurbishment, fairing reuse, and consistent BE‑4 performance at scale.
  - Impact: Expect pricing pressure on GEO/NSS launches; buyers gain schedule resilience; ULA faces margin compression and potential role shrinkage.
  - Watch next: Near-term tells: turnaround time to reflight, Space Force certification milestones, BE‑4 engine reuse count, and China’s Zhuque‑3 recovery results.
