# Tesla Is Recalling Cybertrucks Again

- Score: 248 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45916146) | Link: https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a69384091/cybertruck-lightbar-recall/

- TL;DR
  - Tesla recalled 6,197 Cybertrucks—about 10% of those on the road—because an incorrect primer used to glue the dealer-installed windshield lightbar can let it detach and become a projectile. NHTSA describes the fix: inspect, add a mechanical attachment, and in some cases reattach with tape plus hardware, free of charge; owner letters go out Dec 26, 2025, service timing unclear. HN discussion widens to build quality, “design-by-glue” tradeoffs, and U.S. pedestrian-safety gaps compared to Europe—echoing earlier adhesive-related issues.

- Comment pulse
  - US vehicle safety ignores pedestrians → angular trucks pass while posing external risk — counterpoint: Cybertruck’s lower hood may be less lethal than F-150s.
  - Persistent quality issues → rigid stainless panels glued to aluminum structure plus thermal expansion and vibration lead to parts detaching and poor fit/finish.
  - Customer trust eroding → refund delays and unmet exoskeleton promises, while Musk’s projections outpace reality as Cybertruck sales decline.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Adhesive-only exterior accessories are brittle-by-design; add mechanical retention upfront and validate primers against OEM specs.
  - Impact: Service centers face backlogs; NHTSA may widen scrutiny to aftermarket/dealer installs and pedestrian protection metrics.
  - Watch next: Track remedy durability, failure rates post-fix, and whether USDOT advances EU-style pedestrian safety tests for trucks.
