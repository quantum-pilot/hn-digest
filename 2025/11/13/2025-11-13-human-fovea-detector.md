# Human Fovea Detector

- Score: 460 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45909059) | Link: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dsXzM

- TL;DR
    - An interactive ShaderToy visualization makes peripheral motion effectively disappear, letting you “map” your fovea where motion remains visible during fixation. Discussion highlights eye-movement physiology (saccades vs smooth pursuit), wide variability across users and glasses prescriptions, and reports of migraine/aura triggers from high-contrast flicker. Longtime users recall the shader previously overwhelming ShaderToy and praise its creator’s non-monetized stance.

- Comment pulse
    - Eyes move in saccades; smooth pursuit only while tracking a target → the shader’s dot enables smooth tracking and makes the foveal zone apparent.
    - Perceived circle size varies with optics and pathology → stronger minus lenses shrink retinal image; mild strabismus/amblyopia distort tracking, altering the motion-detection boundary.
    - Can trigger visual aura/migraine-like sensations → high-contrast flicker and enforced fixation are known provokers — counterpoint: hard to pre-screen migraine/seizure risk for web content.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Neat demo of human temporal sensitivity and foveal acuity; not a diagnostic tool but an engaging perceptual experiment.
    - Impact: Raises awareness of eye-movement mechanics and individual variation; may surface undiagnosed issues when experiences deviate significantly.
    - Watch next: Add user-adjustable speed/contrast, color channels, and a guided protocol; publish aggregated anonymized measurements versus age, refractive error, and binocular status.
