# Android developer verification: Early access starts

- Score: 1279 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45908938) | Link: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html

- TL;DR
  - Google is launching early access for Android developer verification, extending identity checks beyond Play to curb sideloaded scam apps. Based on feedback, it’ll add a hobbyist/student account allowing limited-device distribution without full verification and an ‘advanced’ coercion-resistant flow for power users to install unverified apps. HN debates security vs control: critics see gatekeeping that threatens F-Droid and mods; others cite government pressure and social‑engineering scams. Some note Android already limits installer permissions, questioning efficacy and the cap on hobbyist growth.

- Comment pulse
  - This is platform control, not safety → blocks alt stores/mods, e.g., ReVanced; Play’s SimpleMobileTools saga shows gatekeeping harms — counterpoint: updates fight real malware.
  - Done under government pressure → countries battling bank scams want ‘unverified’ installs hard; others say Google drives centralization, normalizing future sideloading curbs.
  - Android already gates installers per-app → F-Droid setup felt safe; hobbyist caps seem arbitrary if low‑install malware is the stated risk.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Real-name friction will deter mass scams, but shifts default trust and leverage toward Google.
  - Impact: Alt stores, mods, and small devs face new hurdles; enterprises gain clearer provenance.
  - Watch next: Exact hobbyist limits, bypass UX mechanics, enforcement in Brazil/SEA; measurable scam-rate drop vs false positives.
