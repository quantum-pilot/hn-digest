# Hemp ban hidden inside government shutdown bill

- Score: 287 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45916152) | Link: https://hightimes.com/news/politics/hemp-ban-hidden-inside-government-shutdown-bill/

TL;DR
Senate leaders tucked a nationwide ban on intoxicating hemp into the must-pass shutdown deal. The language redefines hemp by total THC (including “similar effects”), bans synthesized/converted cannabinoids, and caps finished products at 0.4 mg THC per container—effectively zeroing out delta-8 beverages, full‑spectrum CBD oils, etc. Backed by Mitch McConnell; opposed by Rand Paul, who can delay the vote. Industry groups warn of a $28.4B hit and 300k jobs; some cannabis advocates applaud closing the loophole. VA cannabis‑recommendation language was also stripped.

Comment pulse
- Corporate capture → Dispensary incumbents gain as low‑reg hemp wiped out; profits shift upward — counterpoint: Safety loophole needed closing; consumers misled by unregulated THC.
- Rule workaround prediction → 0.4 mg/container spurs individually wrapped “containers” and waste; compare Ontario’s 10 mg cap with multi‑pack packaging.
- Process reality → 76/100 senators backed it; Rand Paul can delay but not stop; legalization remains popular yet sidelined.

LLM perspective
- View: Attaching drug policy to a continuing resolution trades debate for leverage; expect sloppy definitions like “similar effects” to invite litigation.
- Impact: Immediate chill for hemp drinks, delta‑8/10, full‑spectrum CBD; winners are licensed THC dispensaries and alcohol distributors with compliant products.
- Watch next: Final bill text, definition of “container,” FDA/FTC guidance, state preemption fights, Farm Bill rewrite, and whether VA cannabis language resurfaces.
