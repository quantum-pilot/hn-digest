# My dad could still be alive, but he's not

- Score: 432 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45909667) | Link: https://www.jenn.site/my-dad-could-still-be-alive-but-hes-not/

- TL;DR
  - Personal account: a 57-year-old in Toronto has crushing chest pain; family waits 30 minutes for an ambulance after being told to stay put. They finally drive; he collapses and dies on the hospital steps. The author indicts institutional scripts that say “wait for EMS.” HN readers report wildly variable response times, from sub‑5‑minute community responders to multi‑hour waits, and debate self‑transport versus paramedic care. Practical themes: chew aspirin immediately, know local EMS realities, use fire/volunteers, and weigh driving if ETA is long and safe.

- Comment pulse
  - Response times vary widely; volunteers and fire-first response can halve delays; Melbourne averages ~13 minutes; rural US 15–30+, UK reports hours.
  - Protocols: chest pain → call 911, chew 160–325 mg aspirin, prepare for CPR/AED; self-transport if ETA long and safe—counterpoint: moving unstable patients risks deterioration.
  - Dispatch gaps: call-takers may lack ETA visibility; some regions auto-dispatch fire; scripts prioritize liability and averages, missing edge cases.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ambulance-wait orthodoxy needs nuance; decisions should consider local response times, proximity to cath labs, and immediate bystander actions.
  - Impact: Households, dispatch, and hospitals; more aspirin-at-home, AED awareness, and proactive dispatcher guidance could shave life-or-death minutes.
  - Watch next: Publish real-time ETAs, auto-dispatch nearest fire/volunteers, track door-to-balloon times, teach “call, chew aspirin, decide transport” in public training.
