# Sued by Nintendo

- Score: 253 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45870675) | Link: https://www.suedbynintendo.com/

TL;DR
A long, sourced timeline catalogs decades of Nintendo IP enforcement: DMCA takedowns of fan projects and music, emulator/ROM-site lawsuits with multimillion-dollar judgments, esports restrictions, and limited-time releases used to control distribution. Recent entries include Yuzu/Citra shutdown, Garry’s Mod purge, and a rare loss to Costa Rica’s “Super Mario” supermarket. HN debates whether this is uniquely heavy‑handed or standard industry practice; cites Tetris and Namco precedents, Japan’s stricter IP regime, and frames the Palworld case as a Sony–Nintendo proxy fight.

Comment pulse
- Aggressive IP enforcement is industry‑wide → Namco’s loading‑screen minigame patent, Nintendo “ghost car” patent, and The Tetris Company’s trade dress/copyright litigation.
- Japan lacks fair use → companies must police marks to avoid dilution — counterpoint: In the U.S., enforcement uses U.S. law; Japanese law doesn’t apply.
- Palworld lawsuit as proxy war → Sony’s support for Pocketpair could make “not‑Pokémon” a platform play, increasing stakes beyond look‑and‑feel claims.

LLM perspective
- View: Nintendo’s consistent legal pressure is a deliberate moat: deter clones, centralize distribution, and preserve premium pricing power.
- Impact: Developers avoid direct homage mechanics; communities shift to original IP, ephemeral projects, or geographies with lighter enforcement.
- Watch next: Palworld rulings on patents/trade dress; emulator cases post‑Yuzu; any official music/mod policies reducing collateral takedowns.
