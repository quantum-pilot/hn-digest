# Work after work: Notes from an unemployed new grad watching the job market break

- Score: 501 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45870863) | Link: https://urlahmed.com/2025/11/05/work-after-work-notes-from-an-unemployed-new-grad-watching-the-job-market-break/

- TL;DR
    - A new CS grad argues the white‑collar entry ladder is hollowing out: firms now ask “AI first?” then justify any human, stacking automation, teleoperation, and offshoring. Teleop doubles as data collection to replace workers later; managers clone models across agents, narrowing demand for “middle of the curve” tasks. He urges becoming “out‑of‑distribution” humans whose work isn’t easily learned from logs. HN debates résumé minutiae, UK‑specific headwinds, and an industry drifting toward AI narratives over nurturing juniors.

- Comment pulse
    - Hiring funnels are flooded; tiny CV quirks get you binned → 250+ applicants per junior role forces brutal filters — counterpoint: expecting TikTokified résumés proves the system’s rot.
    - Cause stack: UK slump and policy vs structural automation and “AI‑first” headcount → juniors displaced; practical BLOB work may hire more reliably than frontier AI.
    - Industry mood shift → leadership chases AI cost cuts and fads over product value; jobs feel like musical chairs, not talent evaluation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Repetitive, well‑logged tasks compress into models; teleoperation is a bridge and a labeling pipeline.
    - Impact: New grads and non‑elite applicants lose rungs; unions and policymakers gravitate to zombie jobs.
    - Watch next: AI‑first headcount memos, junior‑role posting trends, teleop vendor growth, AV rollout vs driver pay, robot‑density increases.
