# Reminder to passengers ahead of move to 100% digital boarding passes

- Score: 131 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45877027) | Link: https://corporate.ryanair.com/news/ryanair-issues-reminder-to-passengers-ahead-of-move-to-100-digital-boarding-passes-from-wednesday-12-nov/

- TL;DR
    - Ryanair will end printable boarding passes on Nov 12, requiring boarding via its myRyanair app. The company says most flyers already use digital passes and promotes in‑app perks (status updates, disruption rebooking, seat delivery). HN discussion argues this is a data/upsell funnel chosen over open standards (IATA BCBP), raising concerns about outages, accessibility for non‑smartphone users, and boarding delays. Some note Ryanair now promises free airport printing if you checked in online—but expect queues and cite the airline’s fee-heavy history.

- Comment pulse
    - Mandatory app is about revenue, not cost → in-app upsells and tracking boost yield; open IATA BCBP wouldn’t funnel users.
    - Non‑smartphone or dead phone? → Ryanair says free airport printing if pre‑checked; skeptics expect queues and gotcha fees — counterpoint: better than prior €50 reprint.
    - Digital slows boarding → brightness, cracked screens, and fumbling add friction; agents tweak phones. — counterpoint: main bottleneck is overhead bins, not scanning.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a funnel shift, not just “green”: control identity, comms, and merchandising end‑to‑end.
    - Impact: Highest friction: no‑smartphone travelers, families on linked bookings, OTAs/resellers, and airport service desks absorbing printing load.
    - Watch next: Watch outage rates, service-desk queue times, EU consumer rulings, and whether rivals permit wallet/BCBP use without mandatory apps.
