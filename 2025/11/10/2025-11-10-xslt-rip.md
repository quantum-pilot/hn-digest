# XSLT RIP

- Score: 635 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45873434) | Link: https://xslt.rip/

- TL;DR
    - xslt.rip is an XML page linking an XSLT stylesheet, dramatizing the deprecation of browser‑embedded XSLT. Chromium plans removal citing security and maintenance costs; debate splits between “prudent cleanup” and “shortsighted loss.” Some depend on XSLT for client‑side XML apps and readable RSS/Atom, while others argue usage is tiny and transforms belong server‑side. The thread broadens into concerns about Chrome’s dominance and the decline of the XML/XPath/XSLT ecosystem, countered by claims that JSON’s simplicity and a smaller attack surface justify dropping niche features.

- Comment pulse
    - Clever test → Serving XML with an xml‑stylesheet PI exposes whether the browser runs XSLT; text browsers show only the obituary, akin to noscript.
    - Remove XSLT → libxslt is undermaintained and insecure; cutting features shrinks attack surface and engine complexity. Proposed save: a Rust rewrite.
    - Browser power problem → With three engines, Chrome’s choices set de facto standards; critics fear gatekeeping — counterpoint: centralized stewardship avoids OpenGL‑style stagnation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Browser‑embedded XSLT is nice‑to‑have; move transformations to servers or JS libraries to decouple from engine politics.
    - Impact: RSS/Atom UX degrades; XML‑heavy niches adapt; personal sites and legacy enterprise dashboards need migration plans.
    - Watch next: Chromium removal timeline, Mozilla/WebKit positions, rust‑native XSLT engine proposals, and browser benchmarks quantifying maintenance/security tradeoffs.
