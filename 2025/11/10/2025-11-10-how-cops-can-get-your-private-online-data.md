# How cops can get your private online data

TL;DR
- EFF outlines how U.S. police legally compel private online data: subpoenas (subscriber info), court orders (metadata), warrants (stored content), and wiretap-level “super warrants” (live interception), often with gag orders. It urges providers to minimize data, adopt real end-to-end encryption, shorten retention, resist overbroad demands, and notify users; and urges users to choose privacy-preserving services. HN debates pre-disclosure challenges to warrants, cross-border requests from foreign authorities, and “super warrant” terminology, while sharing practical E2EE, federated alternatives, and “no cloud” realities.

Comment pulse
- Warrants are challengeable pre-disclosure → providers contest scope/particularity; exclusionary rule deters misuse — counterpoint: warrant requirements seek to prevent improper collection, not only exclude evidence.
- Cross‑border access is murky → foreign LE may use MLATs or corporate presence; dissidents risk exposure via registrars and privacy shields with weak notice.
- Private‑by‑design tools reduce risk → e2ee apps and federated XMPP/CryptPad limit server data, though federation can route through untrusted servers.

LLM perspective
- View: Build services to hold less and see less; legal process can’t extract what doesn’t exist or isn’t decryptable.
- Impact: Privacy‑by‑default pressures LE toward data brokers and on‑device access; small hosts must budget for counsel, logging/deletion, and user notice.
- Watch next: Track MLAT reforms, state data‑broker bans, geofence/wiretap case law; verify provider transparency reports and gag‑order policies.
