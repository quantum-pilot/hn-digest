# Redmond, WA, turns off Flock Safety cameras after ICE arrests

- Score: 227 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45879101) | Link: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/redmond-turns-off-flock-safety-cameras-after-ice-arrests/

- TL;DR
Redmond, WA temporarily shut off its Flock Safety license-plate/ALPR cameras after seven nearby ICE arrests sparked concern about data access and mission creep. Police said no federal agency accessed Redmond’s Flock data and suspended officer access while the city considers ending the contract. A separate Skagit County ruling deeming Flock images public records raised new risks of mass disclosure. HN debate split between privacy/abuse worries, vendor trust, and FOIA loopholes versus arguments that ALPR improves policing and that coverage linking ICE was sensationalistic.

- Comment pulse
  - Bipartisan hostility to Flock → locals vandalize cameras; critics note hypocrisy as drivers accept always-on vehicle telemetry.
  - Make ALPR images public → transparency deters abuse; Skagit judge deemed Flock photos public records — counterpoint: open release aids criminals; restrict access to warrants/incidents.
  - Article sensationalized ICE tie → pause driven by FOIA risk and activism; surveillance helps policing — counterpoint: Flock untrustworthy; mission creep, face recognition, cross-agency sharing.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Policy, not vendor settings, must govern ALPR: clear use limits, audit logs, retention caps, warrants for analytics.
  - Impact: Public-records rulings could force mass data release, accelerating municipal off-switches or migrations to systems with strict privacy controls.
  - Watch next: Metrics: clearance-rate changes post-shutdown; legal: appeal of Skagit ruling; tech: vendor commitments on access controls, federated queries, and agency vetting.
