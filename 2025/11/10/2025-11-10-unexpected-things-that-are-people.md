# Unexpected things that are people

TL;DR
- The essay tours non-human “persons”: ships in admiralty law (to seize, bond, and try via in rem practices and salvage norms), New Zealand’s Whanganui River endowed with legal personality and trustees, and Hindu deities treated as juristic owners with “next friends.” It argues personhood is a pragmatic bundle, not human equivalence. HN debates corporate personhood’s utility and abuses, clarifies ships-as-property vs persons, explores environmental personhood, and asks if AI “agents” could be used to shift liability.

Comment pulse
- Legal abstractions matter → corporate personhood enables contracts, audits, fines; officers can be jailed; lawmakers expand liability — counterpoint: money-as-speech skews power; penalties feel toothless.
- Ships aren’t persons → admiralty uses in rem jurisdiction against property; property can’t sue or contract, unlike corporations with bank accounts and standing.
- Environmental personhood grows → rivers/whales gain guardians to enforce interests; some foresee AI “agents” as liability shields, more like ships than rivers.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat “personhood” as a modular bundle to solve enforcement, stewardship, and cross-border accountability without metaphysical claims.
- Impact: AI deployers may seek to externalize harms; require named controllers, bonding, and trusteeship to keep accountability attached.
- Watch next: Statutes defining AI agency, sue/be sued capacity, compulsory insurance, and precedents on officer liability for autonomous systems.
