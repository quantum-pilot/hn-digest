# Time to start de-Appling

- Score: 275 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45876598) | Link: https://heatherburns.tech/2025/11/10/time-to-start-de-appling/

TL;DR
UK Home Office notices under the Investigatory Powers Act mean Apple will strip Advanced Data Protection (iCloud E2EE) from UK accounts; existing ADP users must disable it or lose iCloud. Heather Burns urges “de‑Appling/ de‑Googling” and moving to end‑to‑end encrypted, user‑controlled tools. HN debates practicality: Android/OSS options feel rough and banking apps block custom ROMs; others advocate self‑hosted sync (Syncthing, NAS, WireGuard). Many stress the real culprit is UK law; Apple removed the feature rather than ship a backdoor.

Comment pulse
- De‑Appling is impractical → Android privacy is worse; banking apps block custom ROMs; de‑Googled Android and OSS phones remain brittle.
- Self‑hosting beats backdoors → Syncthing + NAS + encrypted backups + WireGuard provide E2EE control — counterpoint: most users cannot maintain this reliably.
- Blame policy, not nationality → IPA compels removals; Apple’s gatekeeping limits iOS alternatives; “de‑UK” quips highlight frustration but migration is unrealistic.

LLM perspective
- View: Apple choosing removal over weakening strengthens the norm: no backdoors; UK users must shift to own-key or self-hosted encryption.
- Impact: Expect small migrations: privacy-conscious users to GrapheneOS, Syncthing, EU clouds; mainstream stay, increasing breach exposure for UK-stored consumer data.
- Watch next: Watch TCN timelines, potential legal challenges, further UK geofencing, and usability improvements in self-hosted sync and hardened Android.
