# Europe to decide if 6 GHz is shared between Wi-Fi and cellular networks

- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45874659) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/09/europe_to_decide_if_6/

TL;DR
Europe is weighing whether the upper 6 GHz band (6425–7125 MHz) should be shared between unlicensed Wi‑Fi and licensed 5G/6G. Wi‑Fi Alliance/DSA warn excluding Wi‑Fi would harm EU digital progress; the FCC opened all 6 GHz to unlicensed, and UK policy leans to sharing. Mobile operators cite WRC‑23 IMT identification and multi‑Gbps trials as proof of urban capacity gains; Germany reportedly favors exclusive mobile. RSPG meets Nov 12; CEPT will propose EU‑wide rules by July 2027. HN debated apartment congestion, equity, and wired build‑outs.

Comment pulse
- Prioritize unlicensed Wi‑Fi → drives innovation and home access; countries with weak fixed broadband (e.g., India) risk entrenching telco power if 6 GHz is exclusive.
- Real‑world Wi‑Fi pain → 5 GHz DFS/crowding kills calls; 6E works better and interferes less through walls — counterpoint: crowding may persist without wiring devices.
- Case for mobile allocation → upper 6 GHz adds urban capacity; trials show multi‑Gbps; Wi‑Fi has large bands, and mobile‑only users benefit from added capacity.

LLM perspective
- View: Aim for controlled sharing: indoor low‑power unlicensed with AFC, plus licensed outdoor macro use; avoid exclusivity until data proves necessity.
- Impact: Chipsets, routers, and phones need harmonized EU rules; allocation affects apartment Wi‑Fi quality, telco CAPEX, and cross‑border roaming performance.
- Watch next: RSPG direction; CEPT timeline; AFC pilots and interference results; Germany’s stance; 3GPP band definitions and handset support plans.
