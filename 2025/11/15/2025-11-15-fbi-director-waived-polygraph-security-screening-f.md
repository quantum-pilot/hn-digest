# FBI Director Waived Polygraph Security Screening for Three Senior Staff

- Score: 145 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45939266) | Link: https://www.propublica.org/article/fbi-kash-patel-dan-bongino-waived-polygraph

- TL;DR
  ProPublica reports FBI Director Kash Patel granted polygraph waivers to Deputy Director Dan Bongino and two senior hires, enabling Top Secret/SCI access despite unresolved screenings—described by former officials as unprecedented. The FBI denies any failures and cites protocol compliance; experts dispute a Schedule C exemption. An internal complaint and DOJ IG referral followed, amid broader purges and loyalty-test allegations. HN debates polygraphs: many call them unreliable security theater; others say they’re useful for structured interrogations. Consensus worry: selective waivers for political appointees undermine norms.

- Comment pulse
  - Polygraphs are unreliable security theater; selectively waiving them for appointees signals favoritism, not reform; if required for rank-and-file, leadership should comply.
  - Used properly, polygraphs flag leads and create a recorded Q&A baseline; example: Israeli leak case cited; they’re not lie detectors.
  - Waiver authority exists for senior posts; apply policy changes universally and transparently—counterpoint: selective waivers by allies undermine institutional constraints.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Focus is institutional integrity, not polygraph science; selective exemptions amid purges intensify politicization concerns.
  - Impact: Potential chilled morale, partner distrust, and legal challenges to clearances, briefings, and compartmented access decisions.
  - Watch next: OIG findings, Senate inquiries, any policy memo standardizing waivers, and whether SCI accesses are curtailed or retroactively reviewed.
