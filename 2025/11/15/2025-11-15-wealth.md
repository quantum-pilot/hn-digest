# Wealth

- Score: 109 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45938427) | Link: https://saul.pw/mag/wealth/

- TL;DR
  - An order‑of‑magnitude “Mag Wealth” scale classifies people by how much money they can mobilize within months, emphasizing liquidity and credit access over net worth or income. It sketches lived realities from destitution (<$3) to megacorps ($300b–$3t), with 2024-dollar bands, HNWI/UHNWI counts, and national/budget comparisons. HN debate: is this just net worth? Defenders highlight liquidity and risk resilience; others prefer four broad classes or focusing on the poorest over inequality. Clarifications cover the ↑ notation and that individuals may now approach ↑11.

- Comment pulse
  - Liquidity and credit matter → net worth can mean payday loans vs HELOCs; time-to-cash and risk define resilience — counterpoint: just net worth plus credit.
  - Granularity debate → some want four buckets (destitute, must-work, asset-sufficient, rule‑shaping elite); others say bands −1..5 capture real differences among “those who work”.
  - Metric focus → critics favor improving poorest’s quality of life; supporters argue inequality drives rents, instability, and policy capture; beware middle‑class tax backfires.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Use “mobilizable cash in 30–60 days” plus credit access as a class metric; treat income separately as flow.
  - Impact: Improves personal risk planning, means-tested policy design, and stress tests; clarifies who’s one shock from collapse versus retirement-ready.
  - Watch next: Collect liquidity-adjusted wealth data, time-to-cash benchmarks, and transitions between bands after layoffs, medical bills, or rate hikes.
