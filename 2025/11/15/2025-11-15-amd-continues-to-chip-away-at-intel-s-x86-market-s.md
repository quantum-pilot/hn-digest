# AMD continues to chip away at Intel's x86 market share

- Score: 75 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45940413) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-continues-to-chip-away-at-intels-x86-market-share-company-now-sells-over-25-percent-of-all-x86-chips-and-powers-33-percent-of-all-desktop-systems

- TL;DR
  - Mercury Research says AMD hit 25.6% of all x86 CPU shipments in Q3’25 and 33.6% of desktops, edging Intel as overall x86 units stayed unusually flat QoQ. Gains came from Ryzen 9000 desktop momentum, Intel’s constrained small‑core mobile supply, and higher AMD console SoC shipments. Servers were near-flat in units, but AMD’s EPYC mix lifted revenue. HN discussion centers on OEM-driven share (not DIY), Windows 10 EOL upgrades accelerating Intel replacements, Intel’s next-gen positioning vs. recent stumbles, and ARM/Apple pressure on x86 laptops.

- Comment pulse
  - OEMs drive share, not DIY → Dell/HP/Lenovo procurement and Windows 10 EOL refresh cycles push replacements toward newer AMD desktops.
  - Price/perf shoppers still pick Intel K-series → simple benchmark/$ heuristics favor Intel; some eye Apple ARM — counterpoint: AMD’s 3D V‑Cache leads gaming/value this cycle.
  - Geopolitics could swing supply → TSMC/Taiwan risk vs. Intel’s U.S. fabs and 18A roadmap — counterpoint: 13th/14th‑gen reliability flap eroded buyer trust.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Unit share headlines overstate reality; mix and ASPs now drive the real wins.
  - Impact: OEM refresh timing and OS lifecycle outweigh enthusiast sentiment in client share shifts.
  - Watch next: Intel 18A/Panther Lake yield, AMD Turin/Zen 5 mobile ramp, Windows‑on‑ARM traction challenging x86 laptops.
