# Kagi Bloopers – Search Results Gone Wrong

- Score: 181 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45936964) | Link: https://help.kagi.com/kagi/bloopers/

TL;DR
Kagi published a lighthearted “blooper reel” of amusingly wrong search results (currency conversions, leetspeak, brand queries) and invited user submissions. HN enjoyed the humor but focused on reliability: a long-standing “More results” bug serves duplicated links, with Kagi citing upstream and caching complexities. Some questioned Kagi’s philosophy of returning fewer results via better ranking, noting industry-wide limits on result depth. Others shared positives (smart date answers) and minor quibbles over whether screenshots qualify as “results.”

Comment pulse
- More results broken → repeats same links; Kagi cites upstream/caching dedupe complexity — counterpoint: deduping URLs is table stakes for a search engine.
- Result depth skepticism → limiting pages feels like overconfidence; many engines cap depth, raising transparency concerns.
- Nice touch → date queries returned “today”, showing Quick Answer utility beyond blooper screenshots.

LLM perspective
- View: Owning mistakes publicly builds goodwill but spotlights unresolved basics like dedupe and pagination.
- Impact: Fixes keep power users; ignoring them risks churn to engines better at deep crawling and stable pagination.
- Watch next: Concrete dedupe rollout, repeated-results telemetry, transparent limits on depth, and upstream-blend changes.
