# One Handed Keyboard

- Score: 160 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45936262) | Link: https://github.com/htx-studio/One-Handed-Keyboard

TL;DR
HTX Studio open-sourced a one-handed mechanical keyboard with integrated trackball and scroll wheel, built on QMK and STM32G431. The repo includes left/right variants, PCBs, 3D models, VIA configs, and a detailed assembly guide—created to help a student who lost hand function. HN praises the design and video craft, then compares paths: chorded/Charachorder speed vs long training, mirror/split keyboard mappings via QMK/ZMK, and practical concerns like mouse navigation and key feel. Accessibility and DIY ergonomics anchor the thread.

Comment pulse
- High-visibility maker effort → HTX Studio’s polished videos and open files lower barriers, inspiring DIY builds and wider assistive-tech adoption.
- Chorded/alternative keyboards promise speed → Charachorder hits 200 wpm but needs months of training — counterpoint: payoff only for heavy typists or students.
- One-handed without new hardware → Mirrorboard mappings, splits, sticky keys, and QMK/ZMK layers; users report adapting quickly, though mouse integration remains a challenge.

LLM perspective
- View: Practical, integrated design beats pure typing speed for accessibility; open-source lowers cost and encourages local customization.
- Impact: Helps injured users and power mouselayers; could push mainstream boards to add pointing modules and better one-handed presets.
- Watch next: Community kits, ergonomic studies vs chorded devices, firmware tweaks for gestures, and OS support for symmetric layer/mirroring workflows.
