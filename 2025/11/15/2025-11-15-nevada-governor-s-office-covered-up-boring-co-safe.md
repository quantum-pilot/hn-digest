# Nevada Governor's office covered up Boring Co safety violations

- Score: 76 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45939798) | Link: https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnels-injuries-osha-citations-fines-rescinded-nevada-governor-office-documents-altered/

- TL;DR
  - Fortune reports Nevada OSHA levied $425k in “willful” citations after two firefighters suffered chemical burns during Boring Co. tunnel drills, then rescinded them within a day after Boring president Steve Davis appealed via the Governor’s office. A case-record entry noting the Governor meeting was deleted; officials say the citations were legally flawed, while former regulators call the intervention improper. Workers describe ongoing burns and lax safety. Nevada revised OSHA policies for “high‑profile” employers; staff report a chilling effect. HN commenters probe the caustic chemistry behind the burns.

- Comment pulse
  - Burn mechanism → Accelerant likely forms alkaline solution (sodium silicate/oxide → lye), causing caustic burns; TDS/MSDS support—counterpoint: exact formulation/pH testing needed.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Signals soft regulatory capture around high-profile employers; appeal bypassed formal process and altered records undermined trust.
  - Impact: Nevada OSHA credibility, worker safety outcomes, and other cities evaluating Boring Co. concessions and permitting timelines.
  - Watch next: Federal OSHA review, state audits of case files, injury rates, tunnel pH controls, PPE compliance, and enforcement of wastewater penalties.
