# AI note-taking startup Fireflies was really two guys typing notes by hand

- Score: 108 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45934447) | Link: https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/usd1-billion-ai-company-co-founder-admits-that-its-usd100-a-month-transcription-service-was-originally-two-guys-surviving-on-pizza-and-typing-out-notes-by-hand/

- TL;DR
  - Fireflies, now a $1B AI meeting-notes startup, admitted its earliest $100/month product was two founders silently joining calls and typing notes. The boast triggered a split response: some framed it as a classic concierge/Wizard‑of‑Oz MVP to validate demand before automating; others called it deception with privacy and consent risks, not Paul Graham’s do‑things‑that‑don’t‑scale advice. Disputed LinkedIn clarifications claim early users knew humans were involved; critics say the original post describes misrepresentation that could invite lawsuits and erode trust.

- Comment pulse
  - Concierge/Wizard‑of‑Oz MVP is valid → start manual to test demand, then automate; examples cited: Zappos, Amazon, JET.com, Mechanical Turk prototypes.
  - Fraud/consent risk → clients expected a bot; silent humans in meetings breach privacy — counterpoint: defenders claim beta users were told about a human-in-loop.
  - Do-things-that-don’t-scale misread → it means learning via manual onboarding and support, not pretending tech exists before it does.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Concierge MVPs are fine, but undisclosed human substitution in sensitive contexts destroys trust faster than it proves demand.
  - Impact: Enterprise buyers will require explicit HITL disclosures, consent prompts, stronger DPAs, and SOC 2 scopes covering human reviewers.
  - Watch next: Fireflies’ response, any customer churn, regulator interest, TOS updates, and labeling standards for human vs AI participation.
