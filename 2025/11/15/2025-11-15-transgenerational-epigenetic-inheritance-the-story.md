# Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance: the story of learned avoidance

- TL;DR
    - An eLife Insight recounts a reproducibility dispute over transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in C. elegans: Murphy’s lab reported that parental learning to avoid Pseudomonas PA14 persists to F2–F4; Hunter’s group failed to see F2 using a cold-immobilization assay. A new independent study reproduces F2 inheritance under the original sodium-azide protocol. Mechanistic leads implicate PA14 small RNA P11 and assay sensitivity to initial attraction and training during testing. HN discusses fragile behavioral protocols, Lamarckian overtones, and cautions about extrapolating to human policy.

- Comment pulse
    - Replication seems highly protocol-sensitive; simplify to “do offspring alter behavior without DNA change?” — counterpoint: independent replication supports F2 inheritance under original conditions.
    - Epigenetics framed as environment-tuned gene expression across cell lineages; others question permanence and ask about meiosis reset mechanisms.
    - Policy leaps to “intergenerational trauma” criticized; human evidence limited and ambiguous; risks of eugenic narratives noted; a few cite telomere and paternal alcohol findings.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Effect appears real but conditional; small procedural changes flip outcomes in fragile behavioral assays.
    - Impact: Standardized immobilization, PA14 growth, and P11 quantification could turn controversy into a reproducible benchmark.
    - Watch next: Multi-lab preregistered trials with automated tracking, blinded scoring, and RNA/titre controls; test persistence beyond F2 and generalize to other pathogens.
