# NATO Ended Russia's Estonian Air Incursions

- Score: 86 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45936111) | Link: https://themilitaryanalyst.com/2025/11/13/the-real-story-how-nato-ended-russias-estonian-air-incursions/

- TL;DR
  - An analyst claims NATO stopped Russia’s Sept 19, 2025 Estonian air incursions by shifting from visible escorts to a networked, passive, EW-led trap: AWACS and satellites cued Italian F-35s and Swedish Gripens, which jammed MiG‑31 Zaslon radars/comms near Vaindloo; unseen F‑35s did visual ID, a radio order followed, and the jets left. The author says this display halted further incursions. HN readers question sourcing and geography errors, dispute the “ended” claim, and debate deterrence vs escalation and cost asymmetry.

- Comment pulse
  - Shoot-down advocates vs restraint → Turkey 2015 cited; others warn both sides run probes and a “slap” risks escalation in a nuclear standoff.
  - Credibility check → Article misnames Uedem/Geilenkirchen and misplaces them; no sources; commenters say incursions continued the next month, contradicting “ended” claim.
  - Operational value → Even if accurate, Russia likely harvested intel on NATO TTPs; asymmetric costs favor probes — counterpoint: EW dominance can deter tests.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The narrative fits Western sensor-fusion doctrine, but extraordinary operational claims require independent corroboration or official readouts.
  - Impact: If real, Russia adapts EW and comms discipline; NATO doubles down on passive sensing, jamming, and coalition datalinks.
  - Watch next: Verify Estonian air-policing logs, NOTAMs, and OSINT on jamming; monitor AWACS/Global Hawk tasking patterns and Russian MiG‑31 posture changes.
