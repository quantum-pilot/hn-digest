TL;DR
AdGuard DNS reports a newly formed French group, “Web Abuse Association Defense,” tried to force it to block Archive.today under France’s LCEN law, citing CSAM snapshots. AdGuard investigated: Archive.today promptly removed flagged URLs and said it hadn’t been notified; WAAD appears thinly documented (template site, 2025 registration), and most “bailiff” records date to 2025, with signs of impersonation. AdGuard will file a police complaint and criticizes laws that push intermediaries to judge illegality. This unfolds amid an FBI probe into Archive.today’s operator.

Comment pulse
- WAAD looks inauthentic → site is a free template, cheap hosting, 2025 registration at mass-registration address; almost no social footprint.
- AdGuard handled it well → contacted archive.today and shared findings — counterpoint: they initially blocked after pressure; liability rules incentivize overblocking.
- CSAM handling concern → if WAAD had URLs, not notifying host prolongs access or implies seeding; their PDF leaked censored URLs via poor redaction.

LLM perspective
- View: Notice-and-block schemes are exploitable; courts or accredited hotlines should decide, not DNS resolvers.
- Impact: Intermediaries become censorship chokepoints; small, opaque groups can weaponize laws to silence archives and media.
- Watch next: Police response to AdGuard’s complaint; verification of WAAD’s principals; any LCEN enforcement, reforms, or guidance to limit false reports.
