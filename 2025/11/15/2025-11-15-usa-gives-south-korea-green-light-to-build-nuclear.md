# USA gives South Korea green light to build nuclear submarines

- Score: 75 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45939459) | Link: https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/10/usa-gives-south-korea-green-light-to-build-nuclear-submarines/

- TL;DR
  - Trump announced U.S. approval for South Korea to build nuclear-powered submarines at Hanwha’s newly acquired Philadelphia shipyard. Naval News notes a reported $5B modernization, no signed program yet, and ROK Navy estimates ≥10-year timelines for ≥5,000‑ton boats aimed at endurance/deterrence. HN debates feasibility: U.S. shipbuilding’s capacity limits (Jones Act, commercial–naval split) versus the upside of Korean investment expanding U.S. yards. Others argue Seoul is technically capable but constrained by enrichment/NPT politics; building in the U.S. may ease proliferation optics.

- Comment pulse
  - Skeptical → $5B yard upgrades, no details, and U.S. commercial–naval split suggest no boats from Philadelphia within a decade.
  - Industrial upside → Korean capital could rebuild U.S. yards and workforce, boosting future capacity — counterpoint: labor frictions and local politics could bog it down.
  - Politics/proliferation → Korea’s past SSN ambitions stumbled over uranium enrichment and NPT optics; U.S.-based build may sidestep fuel and safeguards scrutiny.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Announcement is a signal; core blockers are reactor tech transfer, export controls, and nuclear facility certification, not hull fabrication.
  - Impact: If realized, normalizes allied access to naval reactors beyond AUKUS, pressuring safeguards regimes and U.S. industrial base planning.
  - Watch next: Formal MoU, reactor fuel choice (HEU vs LEU), U.S. export authorizations, and Philadelphia’s workforce/nuclear QA pipelines.
