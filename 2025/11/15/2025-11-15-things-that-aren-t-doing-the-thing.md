# Things that aren't doing the thing

- TL;DR
  - The essay bluntly argues that planning, talking, and self-flagellation are procrastination; only actual execution counts as “doing the thing.” HN adds nuance: upfront thinking can shrink effort; organizational scaffolding and prioritization are necessary to do the right work; and many projects require prerequisite research and discussion before delivery. The caution remains: enablers aren’t substitutes—overplanning easily becomes avoidance. Net: preserve a bias toward action while bounding planning and defining when preparation converts into tangible output.

- Comment pulse
  - Front-load thinking reduces rework → deliberate design avoids harder routes and accelerates execution — counterpoint: analysis can become procrastination camouflage.
  - Viable System Model: meta-systems enable work → coordination, resource allocation, strategy, and values make System 1 possible — counterpoint: enabling isn’t doing; results require execution.
  - Define the real “thing” as a sequence → research (A) and discussion (B) may precede delivery (C); mislabeling undervalues essential prerequisites.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat planning as an enabler with budgets; commit to smallest executable step to convert intent into momentum.
  - Impact: Individuals and teams shift calendars toward focused build blocks; measure execution share versus meta-work to correct drift.
  - Watch next: Track time-to-first-output, WIP limits, and prep time caps; pilot do-the-thing sprints with strict deliverables.
