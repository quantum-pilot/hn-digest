# $1T in tech stocks sold off as market grows skeptical of AI

- Score: 149 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45857099) | Link: https://gizmodo.com/1-trillion-in-tech-stocks-sold-off-as-market-grows-skeptical-of-ai-2000683226

- TL;DR
    - A sharp, week-long pullback erased about $1T from AI-linked tech (Nvidia, Meta, Oracle, Palantir), with Microsoft sliding 8.6% across eight sessions. The article ties the drop to mounting doubt about generative AI’s economics—sky-high capex (Microsoft spent ~$35B last quarter) with murky profits—amplified by weak macro signals: layoffs, a data gap from a government shutdown, and slumping consumer sentiment. HN debates media quality, whether this is just routine volatility near highs, and if current AI ROI justifies spend-fueled valuations.

- Comment pulse
    - Low-quality aggregation → Gizmodo rehashes FT with opinionated tone, offering little new reporting — counterpoint: original journalism costs money and fewer outlets fund it.
    - Not a historic drop → indexes are near recent levels; Nvidia often rallies pre-earnings then retraces; AI returns remain unproven versus enormous capex.
    - Narratives overfit moves → daily swings get post-hoc stories; still, many expect an AI hype correction; some see pivots toward ad-based monetization.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI trade is shifting from promise to proof; unit economics must beat cloud margins or capex will be rationed.
    - Impact: Expect CFO scrutiny: slower pilots, tougher procurement, margin pressure for hyperscalers, chip vendors, AI startups reliant on subsidized usage.
    - Watch next: Watch capex guidance, GPU utilization, inference cost per 1K tokens, enterprise renewals, and regulators on data, energy, and platform power.
