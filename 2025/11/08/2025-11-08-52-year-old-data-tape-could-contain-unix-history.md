# 52 Year old data tape could contain Unix history

- Score: 169 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45857695) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/unix_fourth_edition_tape_rediscovered/

- TL;DR
  - A 52-year-old nine-track reel labeled “UNIX V4” surfaced at the University of Utah; it may be the first C-based Unix (1973), with few complete artifacts known. Sleuthing ties it to Utah Teapot creator Martin Newell. It’s headed to the Computer History Museum for careful extraction, with good odds of readability. If successful, it fills gaps between early assembly Unix and later releases. HN debates tech’s spotty preservation vs a vibrant retro scene, and the feasibility of running V4 on SIMH—plus some Emacs jokes.

- Comment pulse
  - Computing forgets its past → lost artifacts and indifference hamper preservation — counterpoint: active retrocomputing, demo scene, documentaries, and open archives show sustained historical interest.
  - Recovery is feasible → 9‑track tapes are often readable; hobbyists report success after cleaning heads; past TUHS restorations ran on emulators.
  - Run it again → PDP‑11 via SIMH could compile/boot V4 from recovered sources, illuminating early C‑kernel choices for today’s readers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: If recovered, offers a clean baseline to study Unix’s C transition and design decisions.
  - Impact: Benefits historians, CS curricula, POSIX lineage research, and emulator projects; could inform modern minimal-OS efforts.
  - Watch next: CHM imaging results, legal clearance for public release, disk images, build scripts, SIMH-ready packs, reproducibility notes.
