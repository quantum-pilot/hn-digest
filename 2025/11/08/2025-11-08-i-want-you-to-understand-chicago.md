- TL;DR
    An on-the-ground account describes Chicago under federal immigration raids: masked agents, helicopter-led operations, warrantless detentions, clergy and officials assaulted, kids tear-gassed, and Judge Ellis finding DHS commander testimony not credible and force “shocking.” Court limits are ignored. Residents organize hotlines, patrols, and lawsuits while fearing disappearances and overcrowded detention. The author warns of creeping secret-police normalization. HN commenters corroborate daily raids and school drills, debate legal remedies like Bivens actions, and argue over voting versus confronting majority support for crackdowns.

- Comment pulse
    - Chicagoans report daily raids, helicopters, children and teachers targeted; schools run ICE drills; some communities hit hard while others can mostly ignore.
    - Legal push: enable state-court suits against federal agents to deter abuse → accountability beyond pardons — counterpoint: Bivens gutted; Supreme Court likely to block expansion.
    - Civic response: pay attention and vote to change policy → leadership matters — counterpoint: many voters support crackdowns; ballots alone may not stop escalation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: LLM-made “fact checks” can launder doubt; require provenance, unedited video, and named sources before trusting rebuttals.
    - Impact: Misinformation slows accountability, confuses rights during raids, and increases harm by discouraging documentation and timely legal help.
    - Watch next: DHS OIG reports, compliance with court orders, platform policies labeling AI “fact checks,” and audit trails for evidence.
