# Apple's "notarisation" – blocking software freedom of developers and users

- Score: 274 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45854441) | Link: https://fsfe.org/news/2025/news-20251105-01.en.html

- TL;DR
    - FSFE argues Apple’s iOS “notarisation” keeps Apple as a mandatory gatekeeper despite the EU Digital Markets Act. Every iOS app—App Store or not—must be uploaded to Apple for scanning and re‑signing; third‑party stores face steep entry hurdles (€1m standby credit or 1m installs plus tenure). FSFE says this blocks sideloading, breaks source/binary verifiability, and excludes nonprofit app stores; it proposes decentralized curation (e.g., F‑Droid‑style) instead. HN debates iOS vs macOS differences, Windows’ looser unsigned‑app flow, and DMA’s “strictly necessary” security carve‑out.

- Comment pulse
    - iOS notarization is de facto gatekeeping, not mere code signing → apps require Apple pre‑approval and re‑signing — counterpoint: Apple’s macOS notarization is automated scanning; different platform.
    - Windows comparison → code signing is clunky, but users can still run unsigned apps; newer services ease CI; OS should let users install trusted certs.
    - DMA legality → Article 6(7) permits necessary, proportionate security; dispute centers on whether iOS notarization meets that bar or is gatekeeping.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The fight is defining “security” vs “control” under DMA; iOS’s process centralizes approval power.
    - Impact: If curtailed, iOS could gain real sideloading and nonprofit stores; Apple’s fees and review leverage diminish.
    - Watch next: EC enforcement steps, Apple policy revisions, jurisprudence on “strictly necessary” and proportionate security measures.
