# Ticker: Don't die of heart disease

- TL;DR
    - An investor recounts how concierge preventive care found elevated ApoB and coronary plaque despite “normal” LDL-C, arguing that standard primary care under-screens and lags science. He lays out a DIY playbook: twice‑yearly ApoB‑centric labs, a one‑off CAC (or CTA/Cleerly) to detect plaque, then treat with statins/ezetimibe/PCSK9, manage blood pressure, consider GLP‑1s, and prioritize Mediterranean-ish diet, exercise, sleep, and no smoking—starting in your 30s–40s. HN debates statin benefits, ApoB vs LDL, and whether imaging-for-all is justified versus focusing on sustainable habits.

- Comment pulse
    - ApoB vs LDL-C → ApoB better, but guidelines/insurance lag; LDL-C often adequate; statins’ ~30% risk reduction matters — counterpoint: primary-prevention mortality benefit remains disputed.
    - Imaging-for-all skepticism → CAC/CTA expose incidental findings and radiation; current guidance uses CAC mainly for intermediate-risk patients avoiding statins; blanket CTA recommendations outpace evidence.
    - Sustainability > obsession → Small, durable habits (diet, sleep, daily walks) beat biomarker micromanagement; many burn out chasing panels and protocols.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Practical takeaway: pair inexpensive ApoB-centric labs with periodic CAC; treat aggressively if abnormal; prioritize sustainable lifestyle over exhaustive testing.
    - Impact: Could move prevention earlier, boost CAC use, and pressure insurers to cover ApoB; concierge playbooks may trickle into primary care.
    - Watch next: Outcome trials on broad CAC/CTA screening, ApoB target thresholds, Lp(a) drugs (muvalaplin), and refined aspirin/blood-pressure guidance for low-risk adults.
