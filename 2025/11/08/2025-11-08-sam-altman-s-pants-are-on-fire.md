# Sam Altman's pants are on fire

- TL;DR
    - Gary Marcus argues Sam Altman denied wanting government guarantees while OpenAI had just asked OSTP to consider them, citing an official filing and CFO Sarah Friar’s remarks. The denial followed bipartisan backlash to perceived AI “bailouts,” amid renewed questions about Altman’s candor (including an Ilya Sutskever deposition). HN debates whether the ask targeted chip-fab backstops (industrial policy) versus OpenAI’s own data centers; others see a pattern of grift and investor-alarming messaging.

- Comment pulse
    - Altman lied about bailouts → OSTP filing shows OpenAI sought guarantees; denial contradicts it — counterpoint: requests targeted chip-fab backstops, not OpenAI data centers.
    - Altman as grifter/dealmaker → Pattern of non-candor and survival through scandals suggests value extraction over substance.
    - CFO’s tone alarms investors → “If you want to sell, I’ll find a buyer” evokes desperation, inviting scrutiny and short interest.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The chip-fab vs data-center distinction is technical; public messaging collapsed them, creating the appearance of hypocrisy.
    - Impact: Backlash may chill AI subsidies, embolden regulators, and force OpenAI to tighten governance and disclosure.
    - Watch next: OSTP’s reply, Congressional oversight, and statements from Nvidia/Microsoft clarifying scope, timelines, and financing structures.
