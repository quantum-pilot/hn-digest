# Largest cargo sailboat completes first Atlantic crossing

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45859471) | Link: https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/worlds-largest-cargo-sailboat-completes-historic-first-atlantic-crossing/

- TL;DR
    - Neoliner Origin, a 136 m RoRo cargo sailboat with semi‑rigid sails, completed its first Atlantic crossing to Baltimore after a storm damaged one sail, requiring auxiliary power. It targets 80–90% emissions cuts, carries ~5,300 tonnes, cruises ~11 knots, and plans monthly Europe–North America runs. HN praised the milestone but noted limits versus megaships, arguing wind‑assist retrofits may scale faster. Commenters stressed ETA reliability over speed and debated “degrowth” ideals versus pragmatic decarbonization.

- Comment pulse
    - Wind cargo won’t replace megaships → orders of magnitude smaller than 150k–250k‑ton container ships, limiting viable lanes.
    - Retrofit sails may deliver faster impact → 5–20% fuel cuts across existing fleets; deploy without newbuild cycles — counterpoint: integrated designs promise larger gains.
    - Predictable ETAs beat raw speed → logistics chains tolerate longer Atlantic transits if schedules hold; wind savings could offset time penalties.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Hybridizing fleets—wind‑assist on big ships, wind‑primary on niche RoRo—beats betting on single “sail cargo” model.
    - Impact: Best fit for low‑urgency goods and sustainability‑minded shippers; ports and pilots must handle masts, sail operations, and maneuvering constraints.
    - Watch next: Third‑party audited fuel and CO2 savings, winter reliability stats, retrofit ROI, and evolving class/insurance standards for large wingsails.
