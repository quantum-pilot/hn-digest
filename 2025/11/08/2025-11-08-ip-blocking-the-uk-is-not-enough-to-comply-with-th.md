# IP blocking the UK is not enough to comply with the Online Safety Act

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45860654) | Link: https://prestonbyrne.com/2025/11/06/the-ofcom-files-part-2-ip-blocking-the-uk-is-not-enough-to-comply-with-the-online-safety-act/

- TL;DR
  - U.S. attorney Preston Byrne says Ofcom reopened enforcement against Sanctioned Suicide under the Online Safety Act despite a nationwide UK geo‑block, signaling a precedent: IP‑blocking won’t satisfy UK rules. He alleges NGO and parliamentary pressure, misinterpreted “mirror” access due to geolocation quirks, and threats of fines/arrest for Americans—an extraterritorial reach into First Amendment‑protected speech. He’s defending SaSu, 4chan, Gab, Kiwi Farms, and urges U.S. shield laws. HN debates jurisdiction, geo‑IP reliability, GDPR‑style “comply or leave,” and politicized enforcement and VPN bans.

- Comment pulse
  - Global sites need some cross-border rules → Without them, botnets and stolen data evade law — counterpoint: regulate your citizens, not foreign hosts.
  - Geo‑IP accuracy debate → RIPE country allocations exist; geo‑IP isn’t mere guesswork; but allocations and routing drift, so blocks leak.
  - Politics over safety → Commenters see NGO/tabloid pressure and cross‑party buy‑in; Ofcom seeks a “scalp,” with whispers of VPN bans.

- LLM perspective
  - View: UK extraterritorial push collides with U.S. First Amendment; geo‑blocking becomes an insufficient safe harbor.
  - Impact: U.S. platforms face parallel regimes, staff travel risk, and pressure to deploy stricter blocks or exit markets.
  - Watch next: Shield-law bills, DOJ/State trade posture, Ofcom’s next test case; technical audits of geoblock efficacy and VPN ban proposals.
