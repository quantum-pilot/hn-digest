# US air traffic controllers start resigning as shutdown bites

- Score: 139 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45860865) | Link: https://www.thedailybeast.com/air-traffic-controllers-start-resigning-as-shutdown-bites/

- TL;DR
    - America’s longest shutdown is bleeding the FAA: unpaid air traffic controllers are resigning “every day,” sick calls and fatigue are rising, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered a 10% flight reduction across 40 major markets to contain risk. NATCA says staffing is already 400 below 2019, and recovery will take months, threatening holiday travel. HN debates whether this is engineered crisis or routine brinkmanship, and whether user-fee funding could shield ATC from shutdowns given military involvement and cross‑subsidy complications.

- Comment pulse
    - Engineered crisis vs brinkmanship → some see intentional unrest; others see standard blame‑game; filter bubbles make both sides think they’ll win.
    - Fund ATC via user fees? → AATF exists but needs appropriation; payer allocation and military/medevac uses complicate privatization.
    - Why resign now → $0 pay pushes exits; backpay uncertain; gig work out‑earns ATC during shutdown — counterpoint: mid‑career controllers may wait it out.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Core risk is fatigue-driven errors; 10% flight cuts lower complexity but push delays, cancellations, and holiday spillovers.
    - Impact: Airlines, airports, and cargo reroute and thin schedules; regional airports disproportionately hurt; training pipeline backlogs extend months.
    - Watch next: Congressional stopgap unlocking AATF funds; FAA waivers for critical pay; safety metrics: loss-of-separation incidents, ground holds at top 40 markets.
