# Linux gamers on Steam cross over the 3% mark

- Score: 515 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792503) | Link: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/linux-gamers-on-steam-finally-cross-over-the-3-mark/

- TL;DR
  - Steam’s October 2025 survey puts Linux at 3.05%—a first—while Windows falls to 94.84% and macOS rises to 2.11%. Growth is largely Steam Deck/SteamOS-driven (27% of Linux installs), with Arch, Mint, and CachyOS notable on desktops. Even using Valve’s older MAU, that implies millions of Linux gamers. HN credits Windows bloat and Proton’s maturity for switchers; flags anti‑cheat as the big remaining blocker; debates Arch/Cachy versus “easier” distros; and wonders if Valve will ship a mainstream Linux desktop—benefits and risks both noted.

- Comment pulse
  - Switch momentum → Windows bloat/ads and lag; Proton runs modern titles at parity; CLI seldom needed—LLMs help fix issues.
  - Arch/Cachy near top → gamers want latest kernels/Mesa; Bazzite niche; Mint easier but stale stacks hinder GPUs — counterpoint: Debian testing offers freshness, stability.
  - Multiplayer remains rough → kernel-level anti-cheats block Proton; users default to single-player, older titles via Wine, or consoles.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Crossing 3% signals durable growth from Deck + Windows 10 EOL; at 5%+, publishers treat Linux as a first-class target.
  - Impact: Expect more official Proton testing, driver optimization, and better defaults in Mint/Ubuntu derivatives; Arch-like freshness stays attractive to enthusiasts.
  - Watch next: Track anti-cheat vendors’ Linux timelines, SteamOS desktop installer ambitions, and survey methodology distinguishing Deck from desktops.
