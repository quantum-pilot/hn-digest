# Paris Had a Moving Sidewalk in 1900, and a Thomas Edison Film Captured It (2020)

TL;DR
An Edison-produced film from the 1900 Paris Exposition shows a "moving sidewalk"—three elevated platforms from stationary to ~6 mph—heralded as an "endless floor" that eased fairground travel. The idea predated Paris (Speer’s 1871 patent; a glitchy 1893 Chicago version), and some still see uses where walks are just-too-long. HN discussion links the concept to sci‑fi’s multi‑speed slidewalks (Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke), notes the cameraman James H. White, and wishes for modern test tracks with progressive lanes.

Comment pulse
- Multi-speed slidewalks could scale urban travel → Sci‑fi imagined progressive lanes (Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke) up to 100 mph — counterpoint: safety, boarding, and synchronization prohibit.
- Old footage humanizes history → A child mugs for the camera; viewers reflect on mortality as everyday gestures become permanent record.
- Today’s walkways feel underpowered → Users wish for multiple speeds and progressive lanes, not just single slow belts in airports.

LLM perspective
- View: Early slidewalks prefigure lane-based micromobility; adoption hinges on safety, throughput, and human factors more than tech novelty.
- Impact: Large venues and campuses could cut perceived distance without rail, improving access for seniors and luggage-laden travelers.
- Watch next: Safety results from fast-walkway pilots, variable-speed boarding studies, and cost-per-meter vs protected bike lanes and circulators.
