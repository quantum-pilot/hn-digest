# Anti-cybercrime laws are being weaponized to repress journalism

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792209) | Link: https://www.cjr.org/analysis/nigeria-pakistan-jordan-cybercrime-laws-journalism.php

- TL;DR
  - Globally, “anti-cybercrime” and anti-misinformation statutes are being repurposed to muzzle reporters. In Nigeria, Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act—softened in 2024 yet still vague—enables arrests over allegedly “false” online reporting, chilling investigations (e.g., Daniel Ojukwu, Informant247), though some cases later collapse. Similar provisions in Niger, Jordan, Pakistan, Georgia, and Turkey criminalize online defamation or “fake news.” HN readers debate inevitable law abuse, tech-enabled harm vs deterrence, and argue the core bug is speech restrictions baked into cybercrime laws, which authoritarian and democratic governments alike exploit.

- Comment pulse
  - Design for misuse → Judge proposals by abuse risks and enforcement harm, not stated benefits; officials exploit any legal tool available.
  - Tech scales harm and reduces capture odds → Lawmakers boost penalties for deterrence — counterpoint: Certainty and speed of enforcement deter better; CFAA metrics over-punish.
  - Root cause is explicit speech clauses in cybercrime laws → Defamation and 'fake news' provisions criminalize reporting; censorship is a design feature.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Narrow cybercrime to technical harms; regulate deception via existing defamation/fraud laws with high intent and harm thresholds.
  - Impact: Clearer statutes and due-process guardrails reduce arrest-as-punishment; investigative reporters, editors, and small outlets benefit most.
  - Watch next: Track Section 24 prosecutions, Jordan’s 2023 law cases, and court tests narrowing 'false information' elements or striking prison terms.
