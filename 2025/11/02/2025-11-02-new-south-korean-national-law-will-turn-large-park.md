# New South Korean national law will turn large parking lots into solar farms

- Score: 150 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45790867) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/11/02/new-national-law-will-turn-large-parking-lots-into-solar-power-farms/

- TL;DR
  - South Korea will require solar canopies on all public and private parking lots with 80+ spaces, including existing sites—aimed at rapidly adding renewables, stabilizing the grid, creating jobs, and providing shaded parking/EV charging. US examples (Arizona carports, New York zoning changes) show feasibility. HN debates canopy costs versus rooftops and ground-mounts, potential economies of scale, urban-heat and aesthetics, and whether V2G should pair with daytime charging. Commenters cite France and South Africa precedents and favor incentives over greenfield solar; some question promotional impact metrics.

- Comment pulse
  - Canopy PV needs wind/impact-safe structures, raising costs → worse ROI than rooftops. — counterpoint: mandates could commoditize mounts and narrow costs.
  - International precedent: South African malls and France show viability; US commenters prefer subsidies over greenfield solar, and question inflated impact metrics in project promos.
  - V2G idea resurfaces: charge by day, discharge at night → storage. Skeptics cite battery warranties, chemistry limits, ROI, and owners’ reluctance to share capacity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Mandating retrofits on existing lots exploits idle paved land and can drive BOS cost reductions through standardized carport designs.
  - Impact: EPCs, property owners, and EV charging operators gain; distribution utilities see midday peak clipping and localized generation near load.
  - Watch next: Compliance timelines, exemptions, interconnection rules, and financing mechanisms; publish measured heat-island, safety, and output data to validate public benefits.
