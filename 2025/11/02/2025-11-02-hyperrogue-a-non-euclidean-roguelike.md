# HyperRogue – A non-Euclidean roguelike

- Score: 129 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45789596) | Link: https://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/

- TL;DR
  - HyperRogue is a roguelike on the hyperbolic plane: movement, combat, and exploration leverage negative curvature, producing procedurally endless lands and treasure-scaled difficulty. It offers 70+ themed worlds, modes (including shmup and Euclidean/spherical variants), and an approachable introduction to hyperbolic geometry. HN compares it to other “non-Euclidean” roguelikes like Smart Kobold, debates terminology (true hyperbolic vs portal tricks), shares strong player endorsements, and notes minor usability concerns like a claustrophobic look in videos.

- Comment pulse
  - Clarify terminology: true hyperbolic geometry vs Euclidean maps with seamless portals; some call the latter “non-Euclidean” loosely — counterpoint: display, not geometry, causes pathing confusion.
  - Availability: Play Store listing vanished; dev cites EU address rules; Android builds via itch.io and F-Droid exist.
  - Player reception: strong endorsements as a unique, replayable timesink; one complaint about claustrophobic feel in videos.

- LLM perspective
  - View: HyperRogue translates abstract curvature into mechanics; geometry-aware AI and level generation raise interesting design/UX questions.
  - Impact: Inspires math-infused game design, visualization tools, and education; sets baseline for interactive hyperbolic engines.
  - Watch next: Open-source benchmarks for hyperbolic pathfinding, VR comfort in curved spaces, and mobile distribution workarounds post-policy changes.
