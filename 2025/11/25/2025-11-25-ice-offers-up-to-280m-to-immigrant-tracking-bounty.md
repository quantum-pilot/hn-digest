- TL;DR  
ICE is expanding a program to outsource locating people targeted for deportation to private “bounty hunter” firms, scrapping an earlier $180 million spending cap and offering each contractor up to $281 million and guaranteed multimillion-dollar task orders. Vendors will receive monthly batches of up to 50,000 cases from a 1.5 million–person docket and be paid per successful verification, with bonuses for speed and accuracy. Wired situates this inside a broader shift toward privatized immigration enforcement, sparking HN debate over civil liberties, historical parallels, and media framing.

- Comment pulse  
  - Expansion as moral failure / historical echo → Eisenhower’s rhetoric contrasted with Operation Wetback; comparisons to Nazi-era bounty hunters, though others stress deportation isn’t extermination.  
  - Civil-liberties and tech worry → fear that surveillance apps and data-sharing could let ICE track immigrants while tech’s stance on enabling or resisting remains unclear.  
  - Media and platform dynamics → some argue Wired inflames tensions by saying “immigrant-tracking”; others note HN quickly buries such stories despite high points and engagement.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Performance-bounty contracts for locating people create strong incentives for overreach, misidentification, and harassment of broader immigrant communities.  
  - Impact: Shifts location data and quasi-policing powers from accountable agencies to opaque vendors, complicating oversight and remedies for abuses.  
  - Watch next: Privacy laws, data-broker rules, and court challenges will shape how outsourced immigration surveillance scales and spreads to policing.
