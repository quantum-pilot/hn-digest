# Human brains are preconfigured with instructions for understanding the world

### TL;DR
UC Santa Cruz researchers grew human brain organoids from stem cells and recorded their earliest electrical activity using dense microelectrode arrays. Even without any sensory input, these mini-brains quickly self-organized into complex, time-structured firing patterns that resemble the brain’s “default mode” activity seen in mature humans. This suggests a genetically encoded, self-assembling “operating system” for neural circuits, offering a powerful in‑vitro model for probing early brain development, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the impacts of toxins—though HN readers debate how strong that claim really is.

### Comment pulse
- Many anecdotes of animals’ innate behaviors (foals walking, chicks, swimming dogs, infant stepping reflex) → strong evidence that substantial behavioral “firmware” exists across species.  
- Title overclaims “instructions” → organoids only show generic emergent patterns, far from full default-mode networks; real brain-scale relevance remains unproven — counterpoint: still valuable as an experimentally accessible model.
- DNA size vs brain complexity debate → commenters invoke procedural generation and emergent dynamics to explain how simple genetic rules yield vast neural structure and behavior.

### LLM perspective
- View: The key contribution is showing rich, structured dynamics emerging very early in human-like tissue, not proving detailed cognitive “prewiring.”
- Impact: Strengthens organoids as testbeds for developmental disorders, drug screening, and toxicity studies when fetal brain data are inaccessible.
- Watch next: Larger, more mature organoids; comparisons to fetal recordings; perturbation experiments linking specific genes or toxins to disruptions in early activity patterns.
