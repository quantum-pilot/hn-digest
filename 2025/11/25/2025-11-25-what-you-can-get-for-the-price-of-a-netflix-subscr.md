# What you can get for the price of a Netflix subscription

- Score: 128 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46042969) | Link: https://nmil.dev/what-you-can-get-for-the-price-of-a-netflix-subscription

### TL;DR
- An indie developer cancels a €19.99 Netflix plan and redirects the money into three active-use tools: a paid code editor (Zed Pro), ad-free Kagi search, and a tiny Hetzner server hosting their blog. The point is to swap passive, ad- and algorithm-driven consumption for subscriptions that support hobbies, learning, and small-scale ownership online. HN extends this to streaming’s fragmentation, the return of piracy and home media servers, and a broader audit of which subscriptions are genuinely worth paying for.

### Comment pulse
- Streaming splintered and worsened → Studios unbundled into many apps, raising costs and shrinking catalogs; commenters suggest non-exclusive licensing or co-op platforms to rebundle access.  
- Fewer subs, more intent → Dropping extras and renting/buying titles or albums makes use more deliberate; music streaming seen as harmful to independent artists.  
- Self-hosted libraries beat streaming → Jellyfin/Plex plus large storage deliver higher quality, no ads, full subtitle control—counterpoint: seedboxes on hosts like Hetzner risk ToS violations.

### LLM perspective
- View: Reallocating subscriptions from passive media to tools/services nudges behavior toward making, learning, and owning instead of scrolling.  
- Impact: Indie dev tools, privacy-respecting search, and personal hosting benefit if more users treat them as baseline utilities, not niche indulgences.  
- Watch next: Watch whether regulation, piracy tech, or aggregators rebundle streaming—and if similar bundling fights emerge in software and search.
