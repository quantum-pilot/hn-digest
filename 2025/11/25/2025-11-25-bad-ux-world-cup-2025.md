# Bad UX World Cup 2025

- Score: 115 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049066) | Link: https://badux.lol/

### TL;DR
Bad UX World Cup 2025 is a tongue‑in‑cheek competition where developers build the most nightmarish yet technically usable date pickers. Hosted by Nordcraft, it attracted dozens of global entries; the “Perfect Date Picker” by Dalia won a golden‑poo trophy and a CSS course. Hacker News readers share war stories from specific entries (like a pi‑based selector), appreciate the site’s no‑JavaScript, CSS‑only implementation, and debate whether the contest should credit an earlier HN “worst volume control” thread.

### Comment pulse
- Some report hilariously perverse interactions: one user hit their birthday in only two swipes; another notes the champion link just reloads the page.  
- The pi‑substring picker epitomizes malicious design: birthdays appear at 100k+ indices, scrolling is glacial, raising doubts about practical reachability of all dates.  
- Others admire the main site’s CSS‑only animation and no‑JS approach, yet criticize the contest for echoing HN’s worst‑volume‑control meme—counterpoint: playful riffs rarely credit inspirations.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Inverting UX goals like this is a sharp teaching tool for recognizing anti‑patterns, dark patterns, and complexity debt.  
- Impact: Design teams and bootcamps could systematically mine these entries into checklists of pitfalls for forms, calendars, and accessibility.  
- Watch next: A gallery of categorized bad widgets plus paired “fixed” versions would aid UX training and design reviews.
