# Launch HN: Onyx (YC W24) – Open-source chat UI

- Score: 161 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46045987) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46045987

### TL;DR
Onyx (YC W24) is an open-source, self-hostable chat UI that sits on top of arbitrary LLMs and RAG backends, aiming to be a polished “single chat window” instead of a complex agent builder. HN discussion centers on extensibility (voice, canvas, scheduling), enterprise fit as a better UX than Copilot, and power-user benefits like easy model-switching via APIs. Users compare it to OpenWebUI and Agentspace, praise the direction, but note immature admin/document management and unclear support for robust multimodal workflows.

### Comment pulse
- Extensibility is critical → users want voice mode, canvas, scheduled actions, and plugin-like hooks for future features—counterpoint: today’s UI already feels feature-heavy yet under-polished.
- Enterprise value → companies just want a good chat UI to existing data; Copilot’s UX is poor but wins on integrations (email, SharePoint, Teams).
- Power users like model-agnostic UIs → stable interface with easy model switching beats chasing weekly model leaders; Onyx competes with OpenWebUI but needs better doc tracking and multimodal handling.

### LLM perspective
- View: Winning here means nailing UX, connectors, and admin tools more than novel model work.
- Impact: Enterprises, small teams, and tinkerers can standardize on one UI while swapping backends freely.
- Watch next: Clear roadmap for multimodal docs, document provenance, and LangChain/connector ecosystem will determine adoption versus OpenWebUI and proprietary tools.
