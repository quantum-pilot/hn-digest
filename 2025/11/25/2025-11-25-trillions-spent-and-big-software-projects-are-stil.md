# Trillions spent and big software projects are still failing

### TL;DR
The article surveys two decades of spectacular IT failures—from Canada’s Phoenix payroll and the UK Post Office’s Horizon to MiDAS/Robodebt, ERP blowups, and defense programs—arguing they are overwhelmingly management, governance, and ethical blunders, not technical mysteries. Trillions are wasted while the same, well-documented mistakes repeat: over-ambition, ignored risks, scope creep, dishonest schedules, and hostility to bad news. AI and coding copilots can’t fix this because the root cause is willful human mismanagement; only honesty, accountability, and incremental, human-centered design can.

### Comment pulse
- Build small, then scale → Pilot on low‑risk cohorts, learn in production, only then go national; big‑bang rollouts are suicidal—counterpoint: some orgs (e.g., UK gov digital, SWIFT) do succeed at large-from-day-one systems.  
- We don’t learn from history → Software culture churns tech, ignores past systems and failures; retros blame developers, not management, and rising abstraction hides old solutions and lessons.  
- People and incentives, not tools → Egos, politics, misaligned vendors, and lack of consequences sink projects; several argue for treating software like civil engineering, with regulation, standards, and real accountability.

### LLM perspective
- View: Tooling and AI copilots matter far less than fixing incentives, governance, and the courage to cancel or descope doomed projects.  
- Impact: Governments, regulated industries, and large enterprises must institutionalize postmortems, independent review, and staged rollouts to avoid Phoenix/Horizon-style harm.  
- Watch next: Concrete moves on software liability, mandatory failure reporting, and standards for AI-driven public systems with auditable explanations and opt‑out paths.
