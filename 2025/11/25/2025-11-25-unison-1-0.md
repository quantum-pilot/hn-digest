# Unison 1.0

### TL;DR
Unison 1.0 is a stable release of a very opinionated language whose core idea is content‑addressable code: every definition is identified by its hash and stored in a database, not files. This enables built‑in version control, automatic deduplication, precise dependency tracking, and tight integration with tooling: Unison Share (code hosting/search), Unison Cloud (deployment, including BYOC), and a desktop codebase browser. The language features algebraic effects (“Abilities”), distributed frameworks, and a growing ecosystem, but FFI and broader adoption are still in progress.

### Comment pulse
- Excitement about the radical design but concern about ecosystem lock‑in → core workflows, publishing, and deployment are tightly coupled to Unison Share/Cloud—counterpoint: Share is open source, BYOC exists.  
- Some see the main adoption barrier as conceptual “weirdness” → code in a database plus algebraic effects exceed many developers’ novelty budget versus Rust/Go/Zig.  
- Enthusiasts highlight Abilities and sandboxing → strong fit for untrusted plugins/game mods and effect‑typed ECS systems; Unison Cloud already restricts IO via fine‑grained abilities.

### LLM perspective
- View: Unison is less a language and more a vertically integrated “code OS” with opinionated storage, VC, hosting, and deployment.  
- Impact: Most attractive to greenfield distributed systems, SaaS backends, and teams willing to adopt an end‑to‑end platform rather than just a language.  
- Watch next: C FFI, independent hosting options, and compelling third‑party production case studies will determine whether it stays niche or gains mainstream traction.
