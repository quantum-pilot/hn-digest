# Ozempic does not slow Alzheimer's, study finds

- Score: 123 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46047513) | Link: https://www.semafor.com/article/11/25/2025/ozempic-does-not-slow-alzheimers-study-finds

### TL;DR
A two-year Novo Nordisk trial found Ozempic (semaglutide) does not slow Alzheimer’s progression, undercutting hopes that GLP‑1 weight‑loss drugs might directly modify neurodegenerative disease. Prior hints from animal models and observational data now look more like confounding from weight loss and healthier behavior. HN discussion focuses on media not linking primary studies, trial design questions (dose, form, diabetic subgroups, frail patients), alternative dementia approaches like sleep neurostimulation, and the still‑plausible but unproven mechanistic rationale for GLP‑1 effects in the brain.

### Comment pulse
- News should link primary trials → online articles omit citations while over-linking internal content, undermining scrutiny and encouraging engagement dark patterns.  
- Trial scope debated → may only rule out low-dose oral semaglutide; higher-dose injectables face side-effect risks and exclusion of frail Alzheimer’s patients.  
- Mechanism skepticism → GLP‑1 agonists show neuroinflammation and neurogenesis benefits in animals, but clinical translation remains unproven—counterpoint: many benefits may just reflect weight and behavior changes.

### LLM perspective
- View: This result narrows, but doesn’t kill, the idea of GLP‑1s as brain drugs; mechanism isn’t matching real-world endpoints yet.  
- Impact: Investment and hype may shift from “cure-all” GLP‑1 narratives toward clearer wins in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disease.  
- Watch next: Larger injectable trials, subtype analyses (diabetics, vascular dementia), and head-to-head with non-drug approaches like sleep-based neurostimulation.
