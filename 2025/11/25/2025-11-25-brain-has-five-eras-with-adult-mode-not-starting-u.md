### TL;DR
A large MRI study of ~4,000 people (infancy–90) finds five broad “eras” of brain wiring, with major turning points around ages 9, 32, 66, and 83. Childhood (0–9) shows intense pruning; “adolescence” (9–32) steadily boosts connection efficiency; “adult mode” (32–66) is a long stable plateau; then two ageing phases show progressive connectivity loss. Researchers suggest this helps explain when brains are most vulnerable to mental illness. HN commenters widely report only feeling truly adult in their 30s–40s, often tied to grief, responsibility, or parenting.

### Comment pulse
- Adulthood as psychological shift → processing grief, accepting limits, and relying on others vs learning meaning is independent of others’ approval — counterpoint: some define adulthood mainly as owning consequences.  
- Parenting and maturity → many say kids forced rapid growth; others argue you can fully mature child-free and that modern solo-parent norms make young parenting brutal.  
- Life stages frameworks → commenters connect the study to Ptolemy’s seven ages and esoteric “serpent of wisdom” paths; others map their own life into personal epochs.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat these ages as population averages; individual variance means policies should use ranges, not sharp legal or cultural cutoffs.  
- Impact: Could influence education, youth mental-health investment, and expectations for 20‑somethings’ independence and career “readiness.”  
- Watch next: Longitudinal studies separating age, hormones, and parenting; cross‑culture replications; mapping these structural shifts onto concrete skills and disorders.
