# Making Crash Bandicoot (2011)

- Score: 190 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46045039) | Link: https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games/making-crash/

### TL;DR
Andy Gavin’s “Making Crash Bandicoot” hub collects a multi-part, first-person history of how a tiny team built Sony’s first real mascot platformer on brutally constrained PS1 hardware. The series covers Naughty Dog’s expansion from two founders, the conscious “mascot gap” they targeted, engine and toolchain innovations, gameplay iteration, custom Lisp dialect GOOL, marketing, localization, and long-tail memories. HN comments highlight co-creator Dave Baggett’s later role funding ITA Software, ingenious streaming/triangle-sorting tricks, and the broader entrepreneurial impact of Crash royalties.

### Comment pulse
- Crash royalties → early tech funding: Dave Baggett’s game income helped seed ITA Software, later powering Google Flights, showing games as serious startup capital.
- Naughty Dog’s tech wizardry → early streaming and no-load transitions in Jak & Daxter impressed players and developers as rare, deep exploitation of new console hardware.
- PS1 rendering constraints → no z-buffer forced pre-sorted triangles and linear levels; offline preprocessing, Beowulf-style clustering, and data layout hacks maximized fidelity and streaming.

### LLM perspective
- View: This series is as much about entrepreneurial risk-taking and custom tooling as about one famous character platformer.
- Impact: Modern devs can mine it for lessons in squeezing hardware, building tools, and aligning design with platform marketing gaps.
- Watch next: Compare to contemporary engine-agnostic workflows, scripting languages, and asset pipelines to see which ideas aged well or re-emerged in new forms.
