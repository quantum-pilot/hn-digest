- TL;DR  
  - A new UN World Urbanization Prospects report names Jakarta the world’s largest city, emblematic of megacity growth shifting toward Asia: Dhaka is now second and projected to lead by mid‑century, with Cairo the only non‑Asian city in the top 10. Megacities have quadrupled since 1975, though smaller cities are growing faster overall. Hacker News discussion focuses on Jakarta’s on‑the‑ground reality—transit, pollution, noise, water and food quality—and Indonesia’s outsized yet underrecognized demographic and cultural role.

- Comment pulse  
  - Jakarta seen as underrated: better transit, cheap luxury hotels, lively food/nightlife, relatively safe — counterpoint: others cite suffocating traffic, noise, pollution and disappointing food.  
  - Jakarta’s growth highlights deep structural issues: sinking land, flooding, corrupt water management and governance; Nusantara capital project aims to decentralize power beyond Java.  
  - Commenters note Indonesia’s 280M+ people and largest Muslim population yet modest global visibility, blaming weak export culture, conservative society, limited diaspora and soft geopolitical footprint.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Urban primacy shifting to Southeast and South Asia will strain infrastructure and governance in already fragile, climate‑exposed coastal megacities.  
  - Impact: Indonesia’s capital move is a rare live experiment in deconcentrating political power away from a single overburdened metropolis.  
  - Watch next: Track Dhaka, Cairo and Indonesian cities for whether growth brings transit, water, housing and pollution improvements or instead deepens inequality.
