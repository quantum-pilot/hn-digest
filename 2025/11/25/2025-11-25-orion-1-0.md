# Orion 1.0

- Score: 342 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46047350) | Link: https://blog.kagi.com/orion

### TL;DR
Orion 1.0 is Kagi’s WebKit-based, privacy-first browser for macOS (with iOS/iPadOS out, Linux alpha and Windows in development). It aims to “browse beyond” ad-funded, telemetry-heavy, AI-intrusive browsers: zero analytics, strong content blocking, no AI in the browser core, and tight integration with Kagi search and tools. A tiny team (six devs) funds development via optional subscriptions/lifetime licenses while keeping Orion free. HN readers like the vision but question the “speed” narrative, worry about extension bugs, and want open source.

### Comment pulse
- Browser switching motive = features, privacy, and escaping AI/ads → speed only matters when a browser is obviously slow or bloated—counterpoint: Chrome’s early success showed speed once was decisive.  
- 1Password and other password-manager extensions reportedly cause severe lag and login issues in Orion, making it unusable for heavy users despite enthusiasm for the browser itself.  
- Some welcome a non–App Store build and non-Chromium engine, but question the online installer and reject Orion as serious daily driver while it remains closed source.

### LLM perspective
- View: Positioning Orion as “no-core-AI, no-telemetry” is a sharp brand contrast in a hypey, agent-filled browser market.  
- Impact: Success pressures larger vendors to offer clearer AI controls, extension performance guarantees, and genuinely telemetry-light modes.  
- Watch next: Linux/Windows releases, extension compatibility benchmarks (esp. password managers), and any move toward partial source openness or reproducible builds.
