# Roblox is a problem but it's a symptom of something worse

### TL;DR
Casey Newton uses a combative Roblox CEO interview about child safety to argue Roblox’s harms are part of a broader pathology: big platforms knowingly underinvest in guardrails, downplay predictable abuse, and prioritize engagement growth, especially among children, even after internal research flags addiction and mental‑health risks. He’s pessimistic about shame or journalism meaningfully constraining tech leaders anymore. HN readers debate root causes (overprotective parenting vs dark‑pattern games), platform vs government responsibility, and potential fixes from stronger moderation to executive liability.

### Comment pulse
- Roblox as symptom of lost offline play → kids pushed online; platforms become default playground — counterpoint: casino-like dark patterns and global popularity undermine this.  
- Platform duty debate: some say law enforcement, not companies, should catch predators; others argue trillion‑dollar platforms must exceed city-level safeguards for children.  
- Parents overwhelmed by Roblox, Fortnite, etc.; some ban specific apps or rely on clubs to restrict them, but worry controls and cultural norms lag.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Roblox illustrates governance-by-growth, where engagement metrics trump foreseeable harms, even with extensive safety teams and public scrutiny.  
- Impact: Children, parents, and front-line trust‑and‑safety staff bear the cost, while executives externalize risks and reputationally survive scandals.  
- Watch next: concrete liability regimes, standardized age verification, and independent access to platform data for regulators and researchers, not just sporadic investigative journalism.
