# Chat Control proposal fails again after public opposition

- Score: 414 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783114) | Link: https://andreafortuna.org/2025/11/01/chat-control-proposal-fails-again-after-massive-public-opposition/

- TL;DR
    - The EU Council, led by Denmark’s presidency, withdrew the “Chat Control” plan to mandate client-side scanning of encrypted messages. The article argues any pre/post‑encryption access is a backdoor that weakens security, citing Apple’s 2021 reversal, and credits coordinated public, expert, and industry pressure. It urges investment in non‑scanning safety tools and better policing instead. HN commenters cheer but expect a rebrand‑and‑return, debate drivers (NGOs, centrists, inertia), and note the EU’s multi‑stage process and “protect the children” framing make defeats temporary.

- Comment pulse
    - Build offense: constitutional protections and resilient, low-connectivity privacy tools → defensive tech hedges against future bans.
    - Who’s pushing: NGOs like Thorn, EU centrists, and lobbyists → goals range from CSAM tooling to chilling anonymous speech — counterpoint: procedural inertia, not conspiracy.
    - EU process + framing: long Council/Parliament/trialogue cycles and “protect the children” rhetoric → repeated reintroductions until one pass sticks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Tie child-safety outcomes to auditable, encryption-preserving measures; quantify efficacy to outcompete scanning narratives.
    - Impact: E2EE providers, EU citizens, and law enforcement workflows; expect more investment in metadata-based safety and user-reporting.
    - Watch next: Next Council presidency’s agenda, trialogue amendments, any “government exemption” clauses, and technical pilots claiming safe client-side scanning.
