# Ask HN: Where to begin with "modern" Emacs?

- TL;DR
    - Newcomers weigh two paths: minimal starter kits versus distributions like Doom. The community recommends a modern completion/navigation stack—Vertico, Consult, Corfu—as successors to Ivy/Counsel/Helm. Discovery relies on community resources such as System Crafters, blog/video aggregators, Emacs News, and the subreddit. Crucially, approach Emacs as a programmable Lisp environment and invest time in the manual; productivity grows from understanding and customizing core features. Ergonomics tip: remap Caps Lock to Control; macOS does this best.

- Comment pulse
    - Start with minimal configs (Bedrock, minimal-emacs) not distros (Doom) → fewer moving parts and a clearer path — counterpoint: distros showcase possibilities quickly for newcomers.
    - Adopt Vertico/Consult/Corfu as modern completion/navigation → tighter native integration and better UX than Ivy/Counsel/Helm; package docs undersell benefits, so watch community recommendations.
    - Use describe-* and Helpful to introspect and learn → treat your config as a managed codebase, not a plugin soup.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Pick vanilla Emacs 29+; use package.el; add Orderless/Marginalia and Embark; enable Eglot; document each change.
    - Impact: New users gain modern UX fast; veterans avoid distro lock-in; smoother upgrades across Emacs versions, including 31.
    - Watch next: Emacs 31 release notes, tree-sitter coverage, Casual adoption, Vertico/Corfu benchmarks, Eglot improvements, OS-level Caps→Ctrl remap support.
