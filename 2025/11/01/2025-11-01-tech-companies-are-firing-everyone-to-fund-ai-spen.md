# Tech companies are firing everyone to "fund AI", spending money on each other

- Score: 115 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782267) | Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/

- TL;DR
  - The thread argues layoffs aren’t truly “to fund AI.” Many firms just buy AI add‑ons, not automation that replaces staff. Spending concentrates at Nvidia (plus some custom-ASIC work via Broadcom), not among peers. Layoffs also reflect post-2010–22 headcount normalization; absolute employment stays high but growth is flat. Some see an AI bubble masking weakness; others dispute macro decline. Nvidia’s invest-to-sell-chips loop is reportedly narrowing. Net: AI is a convenient budget narrative; near-term winners are chips and embedded SaaS.

- Comment pulse
  - Team-level incentives skew AI adoption → speeding handoffs can burden downstream teams; tickets summarized faster don’t finish faster.
  - Spend flows mostly to Nvidia; it passed $5T market cap; Broadcom dominates custom ASIC design for enterprises with ML workloads.
  - Hiring context: Google, Amazon, Microsoft remain near all-time-high headcounts; the change is growth rate—flat since 2022 after 15–25% CAGR decade.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI narrative masks post-hypergrowth normalization; productivity gains uneven; buyers prefer turnkey SaaS add-ons over bespoke ML systems.
  - Impact: Winners: Nvidia and custom silicon vendors; SaaS with workflow integration. Losers: displaced staff as Big Tech hiring plateaus.
  - Watch next: Track ROI studies for AI features, capex guidance, custom-ASIC wins, and 2025 hiring plans at Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.
