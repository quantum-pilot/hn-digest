# You can't refuse to be scanned by ICE's facial recognition app, DHS document say

- Score: 453 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45780228) | Link: https://www.404media.co/you-cant-refuse-to-be-scanned-by-ices-facial-recognition-app-dhs-document-says/

- TL;DR
    - DHS records show ICE’s Mobile Fortify face-scanning app is used in the field to verify identity/citizenship; people can’t refuse, and photos are retained 15 years, including U.S. citizens. HN discussion warns of machine determinations displacing human judgment, with fragmented records and demographic bias escalating wrongful stops or detentions. Many see a back‑door biometric dataset with weak safeguards and little recourse. Others argue the lack of a national ID drives messy enforcement. Calls center on transparency, audits, and legal limits.

- Comment pulse
    - Accountability laundering: app match treated as ‘definitive,’ letting agents ignore documents → tech becomes cover for abusive decisions — counterpoint: mandatory IDs could reduce discretion.
    - Real-world fragility: fragmented records, multiple statuses, and name variants raise false flags; anecdotes show TSA/ICE misreading visas and paperwork, escalating to detentions.
    - Surveillance dragnet: creating a biometric trove; bias and misidentification hit darker‑skinned people hardest, with limited avenues for correction or accountability.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Immigration checks are the pretext; the product is a portable identity checkpoint and biometric collection system.
    - Impact: Expect wrongful stops, chilling effects, and cross-agency data sharing; vendors gain sticky government contracts and valuable datasets.
    - Watch next: Demand error-rate disclosures by demographic, Privacy Impact Assessments, retention/access audits, court challenges on Fourth Amendment, and procurement documents naming suppliers.
