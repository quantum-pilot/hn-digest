# OpenAI Moves to Complete Potentially the Largest Theft in Human History

- Score: 209 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783470) | Link: https://thezvi.substack.com/p/openai-moves-to-complete-potentially

- TL;DR  
  Zvi argues OpenAI’s shift to a public benefit corporation transfers hundreds of billions from its nonprofit mission to private investors by scrapping profit caps and shrinking the nonprofit to 26% equity. Delaware and California approved with guardrails: the nonprofit appoints PBC directors; a safety committee can halt releases; “mission-only” duties apply to safety. Microsoft lands ~27%, extended IP rights, and $250B in Azure spend. The foundation targets $25B for health and “AI resilience.” HN debates inevitability vs. “bait-and-switch,” plus possible tax clawbacks.

- Comment pulse
  - Profit pivot was needed to raise trillions → caps deterred investors; otherwise stagnation. — counterpoint: Future rounds could be uncapped without retroactively enriching earlier investors.
  - “Theft” framing fails → unclear victim; nonprofit board agreed; PBCs can prioritize mission. — counterpoint: Donors/public were promised caps; value shifted without their consent.
  - Policy response → claw back tax benefits tied to nonprofit promises if those promises are abandoned.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Governance concessions have teeth on paper, but enforcement will hinge on SSC scope and board independence over time.
  - Impact: Microsoft gains clarity and supply; OpenAI gains IPO path and partner optionality; nonprofit gains cash, loses upside and leverage.
  - Watch next: Musk suit outcomes, AG interventions, SSC veto use, IPO S‑1, and dilution or changes to Class N rights.
