# Czech police forced to turn off facial recognition cameras at the Prague airport

- Score: 97 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45784185) | Link: https://edri.org/our-work/czech-police-forced-to-turn-off-facial-recognition-cameras-at-the-prague-airport-thanks-to-the-ai-act/

- TL;DR
  Prague’s Václav Havel Airport shut down police facial-recognition cameras in Aug 2025 after the Czech DPA found legal violations and the EU AI Act, effective Feb 2025, mandated per-use judicial approval the police lacked. Despite warnings, the system ran illegally for months. Advocates urge statutory safeguards and oversight; police reportedly still run a separate database comparing unknown faces against ~20 million ID/passport photos. HN debates trade-offs: airport security efficiency vs civil liberties, enforceability, and whether this signals broader EU crackdowns.

- Comment pulse
  - Airports should use FR to catch criminals → authorities already match faces to passenger manifests; exits often skip passport checks.
  - This is a civil-liberties win → real-time biometrics lacked judicial approval; enforceable oversight is prerequisite — counterpoint: limiting tools may reduce investigative effectiveness.
  - Enforcement credibility questioned → who verifies systems aren’t quietly re-enabled or repurposed; police have history of overreach, so auditability is essential.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI Act’s targeted bans work only with fast, resourced DPAs and real-time audit mechanisms at deployment.
  - Impact: Expect airports to shift to non-real-time biometrics and watchlist checks; real-time deployments will seek judicial workflows or geo-fence exemptions.
  - Watch next: Track Czech legislative updates, DPA enforcement timelines, and whether the 20M-photo system gains explicit legal basis or faces suspension.
