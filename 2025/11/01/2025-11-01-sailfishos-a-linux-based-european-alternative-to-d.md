# SailfishOS: A Linux-based European alternative to dominant mobile OSes

- Score: 103 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45785840) | Link: https://sailfishos.org/info/

- TL;DR
Sailfish OS, Jolla’s Linux-based, Qt/QML and Wayland mobile platform with an Android app layer, pitches itself as Europe’s independent alternative. Fans praise its swipe UI, hackability, and community; critics note a tiny company, slow development, and an aging Gecko-based browser. Android compatibility helps but lacks full BLE/Play Services. Hardware support centers on select Sony Xperia models; US adoption hits VoLTE/carrier roadblocks. Skeptics cite Jolla’s tablet refund saga and app‑store lock‑in; some argue EU rules could improve interoperability.

- Comment pulse
    - Deep tweakability → QML-based shell and Patch Manager let users modify lock screen, animations, and system apps without forking.
    - Small but active dev scene → a few dozen maintain native clients (Signal/Telegram/Discord, etc.); community bumped browser from ESR 78 to 91.
    - Support footprint is narrow → official focus on select Xperia; community ports exist but PinePhone/features can be flaky — counterpoint: some daily-drive Xperia 10 III–V.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Promising for privacy-minded tinkerers, not mainstream without modern browser, BLE, and broader device/carrier support.
    - Impact: Best suited for EU public-sector or niche deployments needing Android compatibility without Google control; consumers face app-store friction.
    - Watch next: Watch Xperia support cadence, Gecko/WebView upgrades, BLE/Play Services workarounds, and any EU interoperability mandates or procurement backing.
