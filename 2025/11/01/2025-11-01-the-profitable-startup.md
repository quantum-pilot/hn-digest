# The profitable startup

- TL;DR
    - Linear’s CEO argues profitability is a choice and an advantage: small, selective teams reach PMF faster, keep culture, and gain autonomy. He suggests targeting $500k–$1M revenue per employee, staying under 10 people pre‑PMF, and raising only on favorable terms. HN readers agree the zeitgeist shifted as cheap capital vanished and loss‑leading rivals receded, but note survivorship bias, privilege/runway, and that hiring only great engineers is easier said than done. Net: disciplined hiring and focus can enable profits, but timing and market dynamics still dominate.

- Comment pulse
    - Cheap money drove growth-at-all-costs → Low rates subsidized losses; higher rates force earlier profits — counterpoint: Also pricing races, acquisitions incentives, and rising wages/cloud costs.
    - Small, profitable teams as strategy → Linear, GitHub, Stripe show focused hiring works; peace-of-mind and control — counterpoint: Fewer hires reduce developer demand.
    - Survivorship bias/privilege concerns → Year-long beta implies runway; luck and timing matter — counterpoint: Some teams self-fund on ramen budgets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Profitability-as-default fits many B2B SaaS; use revenue-per-employee targets and delayed hiring as guardrails.
    - Impact: Investors reward efficient growth; founders gain negotiating leverage and optionality; candidates face scarcer, broader-scope roles.
    - Watch next: Metrics disclosed by profitable startups, interest-rate trajectory, and whether AI infra costs break the small-team advantage.
