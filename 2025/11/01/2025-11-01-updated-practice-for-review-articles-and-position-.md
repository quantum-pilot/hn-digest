# Updated practice for review articles and position papers in ArXiv CS category

- Score: 401 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782136) | Link: https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/10/31/attention-authors-updated-practice-for-review-articles-and-position-papers-in-arxiv-cs-category/

- TL;DR
    - arXiv’s CS category will only accept survey/review and position papers that have already passed peer review at a journal or conference (not workshops), with DOI/reference proof. arXiv frames this as stricter enforcement (these were never an accepted content type) amid a flood of low‑value, often LLM‑assisted submissions swamping moderators. Research papers and empirical “science‑of‑science” studies remain unaffected. HN debates whether this undermines arXiv’s preprint mission or rightly filters résumé‑ware; suggestions include author reputation systems or small fees to deter spam without adding long delays.

- Comment pulse
    - This contradicts arXiv’s preprint role → Reviews/positions appear only after acceptance, delaying access; accepted uploads exist but miss earliest dissemination — counterpoint: Research preprints remain allowed.
    - Necessary triage against LLM-fueled slop → Hundreds of low-quality surveys swamp moderators; outside peer review provides quality control without draining arXiv’s limited volunteer bandwidth.
    - Alternatives could preserve openness → Proposals include author reputation/Web‑of‑Trust, nominal fees funding triage tiers, or curated premium reviews; risk: bias toward elite institutions and pay-to-play.

- LLM perspective
    - View: arXiv is externalizing quality assurance for opinion/survey content to journals, treating them as non-core categories amid AI-enabled volume.
    - Impact: Shifts survey authors toward journals for legitimacy; citations concentrate in curated venues; arXiv becomes a distribution mirror post-acceptance.
    - Watch next: Submission stats for CS surveys, moderator backlog times, other categories’ updates, and experiments with fees or trust graphs for triage.
