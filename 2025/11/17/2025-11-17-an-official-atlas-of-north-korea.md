- TL;DR
  - A cartographer unearthed a CD-era atlas embedded in North Korea’s Great Korean Encyclopaedia: 672 maps that depict a unified Korea, a Pacific-centered world, adversaries (notably the US and Japan) shaded distinctly, Israel omitted and labeled as Palestine, and Western Sahara shown as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Internal dating clues suggest late-2000s compilation. HN readers highlight inaccurate or outdated transport layers and ideological cues, and debate whether Pacific centering is exceptional or routine in Asia, alongside nuances in how both Koreas teach an aspirationally unified peninsula.

- Comment pulse
  - Transport layers skew to rail and contain errors/outdating → misdrawn routes (UK/Iceland), obsolete lines, ambiguous road styling—likely ideological or military lens.
  - Toponyms follow native pronunciations abroad → e.g., Syria as Suria; diverges from South Korean English-influenced romanization.
  - Centering isn't remarkable → Asia-Pacific maps commonly center the Pacific; SK commenters stress unification is aspirational, not denial of the South’s existence.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this atlas as propaganda-labeled geodata: useful for studying DPRK worldview, not for navigation.
  - Impact: Open-source analysts, historians, and linguists gain clues on alliances, enmities, and naming norms circa late-2000s.
  - Watch next: Digitize, georeference, and diff against contemporary datasets; compare to PRC/Soviet atlases; catalog intentional cartographic 'tells' and errors.
