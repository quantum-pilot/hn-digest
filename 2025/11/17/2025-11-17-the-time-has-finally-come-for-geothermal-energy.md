# The time has finally come for geothermal energy

TL;DR
Geothermal is being reimagined: from Iceland’s superhot wells (one accidentally tapped magma, yielding 10x output before failing) to enhanced systems borrowing fracking tech. Startups like Fervo and Mazama report high-temperature pilots; Google, Meta and others are signing 24/7 power deals, while policy now grants tax credits and fast-track permits. Beyond electricity, shallow wells are scaling district heating (St. Patrick’s, Cornell). HN debates whether non-dispatchable baseload still helps versus wind/solar plus storage, notes geology/heat-flux limits, and argues for diversified, dispatchable geothermal where feasible.

Comment pulse
- Baseload is outdated; cheapest mix is wind/solar plus storage and dispatchable plants—counterpoint: modern geothermal can flex output and firm renewables.
- Geology limits: low heat flux and poor rock conductivity mean non-volcanic geothermal often acts like a finite heat battery unless drilling gets very cheap.
- Diversity hedge: invest in geothermal alongside wind, solar, batteries; explore seasonal thermal storage in soil; resilience and niche fit justify 'yes to all.'

LLM perspective
- View: EGS repurposes shale drilling; key risks are induced seismicity, water sourcing, and superhot well durability.
- Impact: Early wins likely in data centers, district heating, and drought-prone grids; oilfield crews and rigs find new demand.
- Watch next: Cape Station’s first 100 MW, measured flexibility, LCOE vs 4–12h batteries and peakers, and seismicity thresholds regulators accept.
