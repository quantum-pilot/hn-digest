# Replicate is joining Cloudflare

- Score: 258 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45953702) | Link: https://replicate.com/blog/replicate-cloudflare

- TL;DR
  - Replicate is joining Cloudflare, keeping its brand and API, and integrating with Workers, Durable Objects, and R2 to deliver faster, scalable AI infra. The plan: leverage Replicate’s model primitives (Cog, model publishing/running) to build orchestration, agents, and real-time/edge AI on Cloudflare’s network. HN frames it as a strategic expansion beyond CDN/security, with questions on deal terms, pricing, and cold-start latency. Supporters expect Cloudflare’s scale and sales muscle to help; skeptics note Worker AI’s lagging models and a crowded “run model” market.

- Comment pulse
  - Cloudflare broadens strategy → beyond CDN/security into AI infra; Replicate complements Workers/R2; possibly its biggest bet — counterpoint: Workers AI already exists; model catalog lags.
  - Performance hopes → Cloudflare scale may reduce cold starts and costs for real-time multimodal; streaming — counterpoint: keeping GPUs warm is expensive; must undercut fal.ai.
  - Customer outlook → API continuity, more resources, and Cloudflare sales reach could improve stability and volume for Replicate.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cloudflare + Replicate enables unified AI runtime from edge code to GPU inference; speed and cost will decide viability.
  - Impact: Developers gain turnkey model hosting with global routing, storage, and state; enterprises may get procurement-friendly AI via existing Cloudflare relationships.
  - Watch next: Transparent pricing, cold-start benchmarks, updated model catalog, and Workers-native agent tooling; plus edge GPU rollout or shared GPU pool innovations.
