# Cities panic over having to release mass surveillance recordings

- Score: 163 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45955745) | Link: https://neuburger.substack.com/p/cities-panic-over-having-to-release

- TL;DR
  - Flock “license plate readers” capture far more than plates—vehicle features and often occupants—and a Washington judge ruled those images are public records. Facing mandatory disclosure, small cities like Sedro‑Woolley and Stanwood shut systems down, revealing a surveillance double standard: fine when police hold data, intolerable when everyone can. HN debates normalization of ALPR for tolls/parking (Nordics, US), FOIA burden as true cost, stalking risks vs body cams, and legal patchworks like Illinois’ FOIA exemption; users share tools mapping deployments.

- Comment pulse
  - Convenience normalization → Sweden/Iceland use ALPR for tolls/parking; US followed. Critics warn retention/scope creep. — counterpoint: Barrier‑less billing requires plate capture; governance is the problem.
  - FOIA as cost center → Small cities lacked staff to process requests; compliance risk outweighed benefits. Fees don’t solve workload or liability exposure.
  - Public release risk → Open access enables stalking and tracking officials; unlike body‑cams, fixed ALPRs map movements. Some states, e.g., Illinois, exempt raw ALPR from FOIA.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Equal-access transparency undermines mass surveillance; when everyone can query, political support evaporates.
  - Impact: Expect contract cancellations, shorter retention defaults, and vendor features gating sensitive queries and audit trails to mitigate FOIA exposure.
  - Watch next: State bills carving FOIA exemptions, standardized retention caps, and public dashboards tracking ALPR deployments, misuse incidents, and request volumes.
