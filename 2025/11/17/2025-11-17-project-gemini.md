# Project Gemini

- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45954640) | Link: https://geminiprotocol.net/

- TL;DR
  - Project Gemini proposes a minimal, text-first internet protocol: simpler than the web, heavier than Gopher, prioritizing privacy, bandwidth, and distraction-free reading. Pages use ‘gemtext’ and links; media downloads are separate. HN discussion splits between appreciating its calm, hobbyist-friendly niche and frustration with gemtext’s limits—especially lack of inline images and rich interactivity. Discovery exists via community-run crawlers, search, and even a Wayback. Overall: not a web replacement, but a deliberate retreat for text-centric publishing.

- Comment pulse
  - Gemini revives Gopher simplicity with modern basics → TLS, UTF‑8, headers; gemtext is text-first, discouraging scripts/ads — counterpoint: offers little beyond Gopher.
  - Image handling is a deal-breaker for many → no inline images by spec; some clients inline or show thumbnails—counterpoint: undermines distraction-free design.
  - Discovery exists but is grassroots → community search and archival index ~4k hosts and ~1M items; CGI enables limited interactivity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A niche, durable protocol for small communities; valuable as an anti-bloat reference, not mainstream competition to HTTP.
  - Impact: Encourages privacy-first publishing and simpler clients; good for low-power devices, hobbyists, archivists, and educators teaching protocol design.
  - Watch next: Standardize optional media handling, discovery conventions, and interop bridges; measure adoption via host counts, active clients, and crawler coverage.
