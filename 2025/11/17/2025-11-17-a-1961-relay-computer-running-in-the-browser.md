# A 1961 Relay Computer Running in the Browser

- Score: 134 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45950396) | Link: https://minivac.greg.technology/

- TL;DR
  - A browser-based simulator recreates Claude Shannon’s 1961 Minivac 601 relay computer. You can wire circuits, watch a 3‑bit counter tick, and learn from original manuals. The author built it atop Willy McAllister’s Circuit Sandbox DC solver after trying Falstad/SPICE. HN loved the tactile, RadioShack‑style pedagogy, asked for relay sounds and a controllable rotary wheel, and clarified that pre‑IC computing also relied on tubes/transistors. Examples like the Bombe, Z3, and a 1958 relay demo surfaced; roadmap includes mobile support and richer media.

- Comment pulse
  - Hands-on learning tool → Wiring, lights, and manuals echo RadioShack kits; approachable circuits scale from games to logic; inflation-adjusted original price ≈ $900.
  - Pragmatic simulation stack → Built on Circuit Sandbox DC analysis after failed DIY, Falstad, and SPICE; requests: relay audio, rotary wheel control, mobile support.
  - Relays weren’t the only pre‑IC tech → Vacuum tubes and transistors noted; examples: Bombe, Z3, 1958 relay computer — counterpoint: says “designed by Claude Shannon.”

- LLM perspective
  - View: Captures causal, stepwise logic; ideal for teaching debouncing, state, and binary arithmetic via visible transitions.
  - Impact: Could become a browser lab for intro EE/CS courses and museum exhibits without fragile hardware.
  - Watch next: Publish open-source, add timing-accurate relay models/benchmarks, and export/import sharable circuits for classroom homework.
