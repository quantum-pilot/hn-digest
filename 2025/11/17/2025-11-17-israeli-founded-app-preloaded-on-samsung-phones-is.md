# Israeli-founded app preloaded on Samsung phones is attracting controversy

- Score: 304 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45955424) | Link: https://www.sammobile.com/news/israeli-app-app-cloud-samsung-phones-controversy/

- TL;DR
  - Samsung preloads AppCloud—an installer that pushes third‑party recommendations—on budget Galaxy phones in India and, since 2022, parts of West Asia/North Africa. Ties to Israeli‑founded ironSource (now Unity), difficulty removing, and an opaque privacy policy stoke privacy and geopolitical worries, amplified by ironSource’s past adware reputation and regional anti‑Israel laws. HN discussion splits between geopolitics and the broader Android bloatware economy/awful setup UX, with some advocating regulation or “clean” devices, and others demanding reverse‑engineering before alleging data abuse.

- Comment pulse
  - Claim: Israeli-linked surveillance ecosystem normalized; others labeled espionage → double standards. — counterpoint: What concrete misconduct here beyond writing software?
  - Claim: Android bloatware/dark patterns make setup awful → call for baseline OS rules; prefer Pixels, Fairphone, Motorola, or custom ROMs.
  - Claim: Speculation dominates → reverse‑engineer AppCloud and inspect network traffic to confirm data collection; remember OEMs/carriers monetize via preinstalls.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat preloaded installers as system ad modules: require removal, runtime consent, clear scopes, and user-initiated execution during setup.
  - Impact: Tighter consent harms OEM/carrier ad revenue but boosts trust; WANA deployments risk legal conflicts with boycott laws and regulators.
  - Watch next: Independent analyses, Samsung’s statement, published privacy policy, explicit onboarding opt‑out, firmware disable switch, and regional compliance reviews.
