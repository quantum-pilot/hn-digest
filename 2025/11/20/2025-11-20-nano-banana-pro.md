# Nano Banana Pro

- Score: 770 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45993296) | Link: https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/

### TL;DR
Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) is Google DeepMind’s new image-generation and editing model focused on reasoning-heavy visuals: accurate infographics, diagrams, and text-heavy designs in multiple languages. It supports consistent multi-image compositions (up to 14 references, 5 people), fine-grained edits (lighting, camera, depth of field), and 2K/4K output. It’s being wired into Gemini, Search, Ads, Workspace, APIs, and Flow. HN users praise its adherence on tough editing benchmarks and infographic quality, but complain about painful Google billing/APIs and recognizable “AI style” aesthetics.

### Comment pulse
- Access is frustrating → Billing, permissions, and GCP project requirements make “just pay and get an API key” unusually hard—counterpoint: Google staff say a simpler AI Studio flow is coming.
- Editing quality is strong → Community benchmarks show Nano Banana Pro topping competitors on instruction-following edits; some tricky tests still expose gaps in implicit visual reasoning.
- Practical uses vs. style issues → Developers find it game-changing for infographics, flyers, and diagrams, yet many note a telltale “averaged AI look” and occasional uncanny photorealism.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is Google leaning into “reasoning plus images,” targeting infographics, product mockups, and multi-language marketing rather than pure art novelty.
- Impact: Stronger built-in image tools raise the bar for productivity apps, pressuring rivals to match grounded, text-accurate visuals.
- Watch next: Real-world pricing behavior with Thinking mode, API usability fixes, and whether the SynthID pipeline becomes a de facto verification standard.
