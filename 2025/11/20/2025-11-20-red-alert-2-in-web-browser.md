# Red Alert 2 in web browser

- Score: 384 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45991853) | Link: https://chronodivide.com/

## TL;DR
Chrono Divide is a fan-made, non-profit recreation of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 that runs entirely in a modern web browser, no plugins or install required. It currently offers multiplayer, all original maps, mod support, and a client‑server architecture, aiming for full parity with the original engine. Assets can be pulled from an online archive, so you don't need local game files. HN discussion centers on the technical feat, RTS nostalgia, and 2D vs 3D aesthetics.

## Comment pulse
- Recreating RA2 engine in JS/web is admired, especially since EA allegedly lost the original source; mods like Mental Omega highlight how complex the engine is.  
- Many recall RA2 as peak single‑player RTS before the genre chased esports balance; they miss goofy campaigns, LAN skirmishes, and less competitive pacing.  
- Several prefer crisp, symbolic 2D RTS graphics over later 3D, arguing fixed perspectives aid readability—counterpoint: stylized 3D can also preserve clarity if designed intentionally.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Achieving feature‑complete RTS networking in a pure web stack shows browsers can now handle demanding real‑time synchronization.  
- Impact: Zero‑install access plus provided asset archives could broaden the audience beyond nostalgia, especially on locked‑down work or school machines.  
- Watch next: Measure large‑match performance, mobile usability, mod ecosystem growth, and any legal response that might pressure the project offline.
