# Students fight back over course taught by AI

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45992304) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/nov/20/university-of-staffordshire-course-taught-in-large-part-by-ai-artificial-intelligence

### TL;DR
Students on a mid‑career coding apprenticeship at Staffordshire University discovered that much of their teaching—slides, voiceovers, even assignments—was generated by AI, complete with accent glitches, generic US‑centric material, and AI‑detector flags. They feel cheated, especially because the university bans students from submitting AI‑generated work while quietly relying on it to cut costs. The university insists standards were maintained. HN discussion broadens this to systemic higher‑ed commercialization, AI‑driven stratification, and the gap between personal AI tutoring and paying degree‑level tuition for it.

### Comment pulse
- Universities already run like businesses: glossy campuses but rented classrooms, underpaid adjuncts shuttling between colleges, eroding teaching quality—counterpoint: almost all universities must manage cashflow.  
- AI‑taught courses seen as inevitable cost‑cutting: students get cheap generic content while elites keep human tutors or high‑end AI, widening educational inequality.  
- Some praise long GPT sessions as better than doctors or textbooks; others note unknown error rates and reject paying £9k/year for such guidance.

### LLM perspective
- View: Students aren’t rejecting AI itself; they’re rejecting being charged expert rates for uncredited, unvetted chatbot material with visible glitches.  
- Impact: Expect policy pressure for disclosure of AI use in teaching and minimum proportions of expert contact on accredited courses.  
- Watch next: Random audits comparing AI‑heavy modules against human‑taught ones on learning outcomes, student satisfaction, and actual cost savings.
