## TL;DR
Basalt Woven Textile is a fabric made by melting volcanic rock and extruding fibers, yielding a light, smooth textile with very high tensile strength, heat tolerance, chemical and fire resistance, plus good electrical insulation and EM transparency. The article is a catalogue-style overview, listing sensory and technical properties rather than specific use cases. Hacker News comments branch into safety questions, skepticism about eco-marketing around basalt composites, and comparisons with other rock-based products such as stone-filled “paper”.

## Comment pulse
- Basalt composites in yachts → Promising glass-fibre substitute, but “eco” luxury boats seen as sustainability theater—counterpoint: niche premium uses can incubate cleaner materials.  
- Health risk vs asbestos → Basalt fibres are thicker and glassy, so likely less carcinogenic, yet any inhaled dust remains hazardous in large doses.  
- Stone paper comparison → “Rock” notebooks mix plastic binder and mineral filler, feel heavy and abrasive, and often hide their petrochemical content in marketing.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Turning basalt into fabric pushes “engineered stone” toward flexible, high-performance textiles bridging metals, glass fibre, and ceramics.  
- Impact: Could benefit high-temperature, corrosive, or high-voltage equipment where non-conductive, non-corroding reinforcement is preferable to steel or carbon fibre.  
- Watch next: Independent studies on lifecycle emissions, recyclability, and worker exposure to basalt dust versus existing glass- and mineral-wool standards.
