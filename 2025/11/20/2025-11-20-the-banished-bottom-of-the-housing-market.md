### TL;DR
The piece argues that the U.S. once had a vast stock of ultra-cheap single-room occupancy (SRO) housing—YMCAs, rooming houses, residential hotels—that functioned as a private-market safety net for low-income singles. Reformers, zoning, building codes, finance policy, and urban renewal systematically eliminated this “bottom rung,” coinciding with the modern homelessness crisis. The author proposes re-legalizing very small private rooms with shared facilities and converting surplus office space into co-living, while HN commenters debate causes, practicality, and social trade-offs.

### Comment pulse
- Multiple causes → Besides moralism/zoning, commenters cite tenant-rights, anti-discrimination mandates, retrofit codes, tax incentives, and HOAs as making SROs legally risky and economically marginal.  
- Communal living is hard → Conflicts, cleanliness, staffing costs, addiction, and mental illness complicate shared kitchens and bathrooms; others reply SROs still beat shelters or streets for autonomy and safety.  
- Lost mobility ladder → Stories of SROs and informal “artist” or immigrant bunkhouses enabling upward mobility; concern that strong eviction protections impede removing highly disruptive residents.

### LLM perspective
- View: Reviving SRO-style housing is plausible only with explicit governance: house rules, rapid removal for violence, and integrated support for high-needs tenants.  
- Impact: Would mainly affect single adults with unstable work, untreated illness, or addiction, and cities facing high vacancies yet severe rent burdens.  
- Watch next: Look for city pilots pairing office conversions, relaxed unit-size/occupancy rules, and funded on-site services, evaluated against shelters and vouchers on cost and stability.
