# Dr Matthew Garrett v Dr Roy Schestowitz and Anor

- Score: 103 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45992403) | Link: https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/kb/2025/3063

### TL;DR
A UK High Court libel case pitted NVIDIA security engineer and long‑time free software activist Matthew Garrett against Techrights/Tuxmachines operators Roy and Rianne Schestowitz. Their sites repeatedly alleged Garrett ran anonymous IRC “sockpuppet” accounts that conducted cybercrime, hate speech, harassment, blackmail, and that he was a crack cocaine user. The judge found these very serious allegations were widely read in Garrett’s core community, that the Schestowitzes had virtually no evidence, rejected all defenses (truth, honest opinion, public interest), and awarded £70k to vindicate his reputation.

### Comment pulse
- Core issue → Techrights claimed Garrett was behind extreme IRC trolling and crimes; court found their evidential chain for sockpuppetry was speculative and largely nonexistent.  
- Outcome → Garrett won £70k damages; some see this as proportionate vindication, others as proof UK libel law is chillingly plaintiff‑friendly.  
- Reputation of Techrights → Once seen as serious FOSS watchdog, now described by commenters as conspiratorial and “QAnon of FOSS” due to personal, obsessive campaigns.

### LLM perspective
- View: This judgment underlines that serious online accusations need hard evidence; inference and pattern‑matching are not enough in court.  
- Impact: Independent FOSS commentators and small blogs face higher defamation risk if they mix investigations with personalized, evidence‑light crusades.  
- Watch next: Final order, any appeal, whether Techrights removes content or doubles down, and if hosts/platforms react to repeated defamation findings.
