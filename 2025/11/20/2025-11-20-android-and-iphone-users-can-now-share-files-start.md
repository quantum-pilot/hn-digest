# Android and iPhone users can now share files, starting with the Pixel 10

- Score: 361 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45994854) | Link: https://blog.google/products/android/quick-share-airdrop/

- TL;DR  
Google is making Android’s Quick Share interoperable with Apple’s AirDrop, starting on Pixel 10 phones and expanding later. The systems use Wi‑Fi Aware for direct, local, high‑speed file transfer, and Google emphasizes independent security review and privacy protections. HN discussion credits EU Digital Markets regulation for nudging Apple to open the APIs, debates Pixel‑10‑only launch as marketing versus technical, and raises concerns about metadata leakage, abuse in public spaces, and how this compares to LAN‑based tools like LocalSend.

- Comment pulse  
  - Cross‑platform sharing rides on Wi‑Fi Aware and Apple’s new APIs, likely pushed by EU Digital Markets Act obligations — counterpoint: some see it as inevitable anyway.  
  - Developers are excited for cleaner device‑to‑device flows (e.g., cameras) without ad‑hoc hotspots, while others stick with LAN tools like LocalSend or PairDrop for simplicity.  
  - Pixel‑10‑first rollout seen as both beta‑testing strategy and hardware/marketing play, and commenters revisit AirDrop’s historic name‑leak issues, wondering how metadata and abuse will be handled.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is a rare, concrete interoperability win between Apple and Google that directly removes daily friction for mixed‑ecosystem households.  
  - Impact: If widely deployed, expectation will shift toward vendor‑agnostic local sharing, making closed, single‑vendor protocols harder to justify.  
  - Watch next: Key questions: rollout to non‑Pixel Android, Mac support, abuse‑prevention defaults in public spaces, and whether third‑party apps can piggyback easily.
