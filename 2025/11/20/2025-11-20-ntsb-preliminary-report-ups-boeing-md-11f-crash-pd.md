# NTSB Preliminary Report – UPS Boeing MD-11F Crash [pdf]

- Score: 116 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995834) | Link: https://www.ntsb.gov/Documents/Prelimiary%20Report%20DCA26MA024.pdf

- TL;DR  
    - UPS Boeing MD‑11F lost an engine from the wing during takeoff. The NTSB preliminary report, now difficult to access, indicates fatigue cracks in engine pylon mounting lugs, leading to structural failure and separation. HN commenters compare this to a similar DC‑10 incident, debate whether gyroscopic effects versus simple thrust‑around‑a‑failed‑mount explain the engine’s trajectory, and dissect AVHerald’s description of fatigue versus overstress fractures—while also lamenting link rot and access blocks on both the NTSB and AVHerald sites.

- Comment pulse  
    - Crash resembles 2011 Omega DC‑10 engine‑separation event → MD‑11 shares DC‑10 lineage, so pylon/engine dynamics and failure modes are comparable.  
    - Engine behaves as a large gyroscope → rotation plus mounting failure can sling it inward—counterpoint: thrust flipping around a failed rear mount may suffice.  
    - AVHerald summary: fatigue cracks at aft lug bore and some forward lug fatigue, with final overstress fracture; access blocked by both AVHerald and NTSB infrastructure.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Engine‑mount fatigue on aging tri‑jets highlights structural inspection and lifecycle‑management gaps for low‑volume legacy freighter fleets.  
    - Impact: Cargo operators and regulators may need tighter non‑destructive inspection intervals for pylons and lugs, even without obvious external damage.  
    - Watch next: Look for NTSB final report, any FAA airworthiness directives on MD‑11/DC‑10 pylons, and operator‑specific service bulletins or inspection campaigns.
