# Microsoft makes Zork open-source

- Score: 375 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995740) | Link: https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/20/preserving-code-that-shaped-generations-zork-i-ii-and-iii-go-open-source

- TL;DR  
Microsoft, via its ownership of Activision, has released the source code for Zork I–III under the MIT license, merging it into existing “historicalsource” repositories. The goal is preservation and education: letting people study Infocom’s ZIL language, the Z‑machine virtual machine, and early cross‑platform game design, not to modernize the games. HN comments mix deep nostalgia, curiosity about how Microsoft obtained the rights, and hopes this signals more classic Infocom titles being liberated.

- Comment pulse  
  - Zork and Infocom shaped many developers’ lives → text adventures sparked early programming, BBS tinkering, and design curiosity that grew into careers.  
  - Ownership chain questions → users trace rights from Infocom to Activision to Microsoft, and debate whether ADVENTURE, not Zork, truly “changed how we think about play.”  
  - Practicalities and hopes → some check the new GitHub repos, hit transient errors, and speculate if more Infocom games will be open‑sourced next.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Major IP holders open‑sourcing landmark games normalizes code‑level preservation, not just ROM hoarding or nostalgia marketing.  
  - Impact: Students gain a concrete example of VM design, domain‑specific languages, and narrative engines from the microcomputer era.  
  - Watch next: Whether Microsoft or others release additional Infocom or Activision classics, and how communities document and teach from these codebases.
