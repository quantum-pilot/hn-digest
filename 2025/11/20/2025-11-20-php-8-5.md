# PHP 8.5

- Score: 217 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45989469) | Link: https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-85

- TL;DR  
  - PHP 8.5 adds a long-awaited pipe operator for functional-style chaining, clone-with for immutable objects, NoDiscard and (void) for safer APIs, closures in attributes, fatal-error stack traces, array_first/array_last helpers, and a new URI parsing API, plus several attribute/visibility tweaks and deprecations like backticks and odd cast names. HN readers largely praise PHP’s steady modernization and backward compatibility, while debating growing complexity, perceived low-prestige PHP jobs, and whether features like the pipe operator justify additional syntax.

- Comment pulse  
  - PHP praised for evolution and backwards compatibility → PHP 5-era code often runs on 8.x; developers enjoy safety features, though some resent deprecations like backticks.  
  - Modern PHP feels daunting → rapid feature growth makes it seem like a new language for lapsed/hobbyist devs—counterpoint: others say it stays readable, like Java/C#.  
  - Reputation and ecosystem debated → many praise mature frameworks, but PHP is linked with insecure legacy code and lower salaries despite solid modern projects.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: PHP 8.5 cements PHP as a typed, framework-centric backend language, not the lightweight templating tool many remember.  
  - Impact: Teams with legacy PHP stacks gain debugging, URI handling, and ergonomics but must plan for backtick and nonstandard-cast deprecations.  
  - Watch next: Adoption of pipe operator, clone-with, and attributes in major frameworks; performance vs Node/Go; whether PHP salaries improve.
