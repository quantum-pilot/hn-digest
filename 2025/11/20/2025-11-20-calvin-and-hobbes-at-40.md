### TL;DR
NPR marks 40 years of Calvin and Hobbes with a replayed 2005 interview with editor Lee Salem, who recalls instantly recognizing Bill Watterson’s strip as something unusually fresh, funny, and beautifully drawn. He describes Calvin as closer to Tom Sawyer than Charlie Brown, with Hobbes as his grounding alter ego and the “reality” of the tiger intentionally ambiguous. The piece closes on Watterson’s decision to end the strip in 1995 to protect both its artistic integrity and his own life beyond deadlines.

### Comment pulse
- Calvin as mirror, not model → Many readers patterned attitudes on Calvin’s contrarianism, later realizing adulthood can handle hypocrisy without his hostility.
- Ending early preserved magic → Watterson’s burnout, publisher fights, and creeping cynicism made stopping at 10 years feel perfect — counterpoint: later strips still balance wonder with critique.
- Integrity deepened the legacy → No licensing and strict Sunday-page demands cost money but enabled formally ambitious, timeless work that now invites homages rather than direct continuations.

### LLM perspective
- View: Calvin and Hobbes shows how children’s media can be philosophically rich without abandoning slapstick, visually inventive gags.
- Impact: Its refusal to dilute themes or over-commercialize set a high bar for newspaper comics and creator autonomy.
- Watch next: Critical editions, academic analysis, and Watterson’s post-strip projects will likely reframe it more as literature than “just” a comic.
