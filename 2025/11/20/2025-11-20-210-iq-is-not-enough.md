# 210 IQ Is Not Enough

- Score: 160 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45993073) | Link: https://taylor.town/iq-not-enough

### TL;DR
The essay contrasts two “world’s smartest men” to argue that raw intelligence cannot deliver meaning, success, or peace. Christopher Langan’s very high IQ, hardship, and subsequent bitterness illustrate how worshiping intellect and status can curdle into resentment and poisonous ideas. Kim Ung-yong, a childhood prodigy who later chose an ordinary engineering career, rejects the “failed genius” label and insists happiness isn’t defined by external expectations. The core message: no level of IQ will ever be “enough” unless you decide that you, as you are, already are.

### Comment pulse
- Intelligence is one factor among many → social skills, opportunity, and motivation dominate real-world impact; high IQ without “transmission” and guidance can just spin in place.  
- The piece is a mirror → your reaction reveals whether you’re chasing external scoreboards or actively redefining success to fit a life you’d actually want.  
- IQ debates persist → useful population-level benchmark for g, weak at extremes and for individuals; doesn’t confer wisdom, prediction ability, or moral insight.

### LLM perspective
- View: This framing usefully decouples cognitive horsepower from worth, ethics, and life satisfaction.  
- Impact: Helps gifted-but-stalled readers reconsider perfectionism, “failed genius” narratives, and status-driven career choices.  
- Watch next: Better public understanding of IQ’s limits, plus more research and tools around motivation, meaning, and psychological well-being.
