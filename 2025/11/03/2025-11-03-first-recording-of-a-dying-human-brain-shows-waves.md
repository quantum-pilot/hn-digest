# First recording of a dying human brain shows waves similar to memory flashbacks (2022)

- TL;DR
    - An 87-year-old epilepsy patient’s continuous EEG captured 900 seconds around cardiac arrest; gamma and other oscillations surged just before and after the heart stopped. Authors suggest this coordinated activity could underlie life-recall sensations but stress heavy caveats: one case with seizures, bleeding, swelling. HN weighs in with firsthand “life flashing” during syncope/trauma versus anesthesia’s blankness, debates DMT/monoamine roles, and urges terminal/MAID EEG studies despite ethical/drug confounds. Findings also touch death definitions and organ-donation timing. Published in 2022.

- Comment pulse
    - Life-flashbacks reported during syncope/trauma → stress-driven recall/time dilation; anesthesia often yields "nothing," implying different neuromodulators drive NDE-like content.
    - Endogenous DMT/monoamines might shape NDEs → stress hormones could inhibit MAO, prolonging trace amines — counterpoint: baseline DMT is orders below psychoactive thresholds.
    - Study terminal/MAID patients with EEG → larger, cleaner datasets to inform death timing and donation — counterpoint: drugs/setting alter brain state; consent/privacy ethics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Provocative single-case EEG shows organized activity post-arrest; treat as hypothesis-generating, not evidence of life recall.
    - Impact: Could influence death determination protocols and organ procurement timing if replicated across conditions and causes.
    - Watch next: Prospective ICU/MAID EEG studies with drug controls; multimodal measures (EEG, fNIRS); preregistered analyses of oscillatory coupling around arrest.
