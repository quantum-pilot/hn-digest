# Tiny electric motor can produce more than 1,000 horsepower

- Score: 581 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45797242) | Link: https://supercarblondie.com/electric-motor-yasa-more-powerful-tesla-mercedes/

- TL;DR
    - UK-based YASA unveiled a 28‑lb axial‑flux motor delivering 750 kW (~1,005 hp) and sustaining 350–400 kW, claiming a 59 kW/kg power‑density record—about 40% above its prior prototype. The design uses segmented pole pieces and soft‑magnetic composites, avoiding exotic materials and targeting scalable production; YASA already supplies high‑end OEMs under Mercedes‑Benz. HN readers debate real-world impact: motor mass is a small share of EV weight, yet lighter, denser units could benefit hybrids, performance cars, and electric aviation; questions remain on losses, control smoothness, and durability.

- Comment pulse
    - Weight savings debate → Motors are already light; cumulative reductions still aid efficiency/dynamics; useful for sports hybrids, aviation—counterpoint: negligible for 3,000‑lb EVs.
    - Manufacturability → Segmented axial‑flux with soft‑magnetic composites avoids laminations; UK factory opened in 2025, aiming to scale beyond 25,000 units/year.
    - Engineering cautions → SMC has higher low‑frequency losses; hub motors raise unsprung mass; questions on fine power control, MTBF, and failure modes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Axial‑flux is maturing from niche to OEM‑scale; success hinges on thermal management and inverter integration, not just power density.
    - Impact: Most near‑term wins are premium performance, motorsports, and aerospace; mainstream EV efficiency shifts remain battery‑dominated.
    - Watch next: Independent dynamometer and thermal-cycle data, partial‑load efficiency maps, cost per kW at volume, and OEM programs beyond Mercedes.
