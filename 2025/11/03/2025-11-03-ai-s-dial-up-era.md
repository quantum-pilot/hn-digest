# AI's Dial-Up Era

- TL;DR
  - The piece argues we’re in AI’s “early internet” phase: hype and uneven job impacts. Jevons-style demand expansion can boost employment until needs saturate; outcomes hinge on unmet demand versus automation speed. Historical automation shows gains then declines once demand plateaus; software’s latent demand could surge. Expect overbuilding and failures, but hyperscaler capex likely lays durable infrastructure; Azhar’s gauges say demand-led boom, not bubble—yet. HN debate centers on mainframe-like centralization vs emerging distributed models, and whether breakthroughs could quickly flip the economics.

- Comment pulse
  - We’re in a mainframe era, not dial-up → centralized, costly models; even “local-first” tools rely on cloud — counterpoint: small distributed models already exist.
  - Certainty is hubris → no one knows the trajectory; declaring either “bubble” or “inevitable” is premature.
  - Breakthroughs can flip assumptions → linear attention and on-device models could slash costs, eroding hyperscaler moats and changing employment timing.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat AI impact as demand-versus-automation curves; plan for phases: expansion, plateau, then displacement.
  - Impact: Infra overbuild lowers future inference costs; strengthens open-source, on-device, and vertical-specific tooling.
  - Watch next: Track $/query, latency, power/TOPS, and regulatory approvals; watch SME adoption and rote-document workflows for early labor shifts.
