# I analyzed 180M jobs to see what jobs AI is replacing today

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45798489) | Link: https://bloomberry.com/blog/i-analyzed-180m-jobs-to-see-what-jobs-ai-is-actually-replacing-today/

- TL;DR
    - A 180M-posting analysis (2023–Oct 2025) normalizes 650 titles to spot 2025 outliers versus an −8% market. Sharpest declines: creative execution (CG artists −33%, photographers −28%, writers −28%) and US-driven compliance/sustainability; medical scribes −20% are a watchlist. Growth clusters in AI: ML engineers +40%, robotics/data center/scientists up; influencer marketers +18%. Senior leadership nearly flat while ICs fall; software engineering resilient; customer service −4% resists mass replacement. HN questions absent absolute counts, short horizons, and post‑pandemic/ZIRP confounders.

- Comment pulse
    - Method lacks volumes and longer baselines; post‑pandemic swings distort trends; missing SDR/AE; security engineering dip raises data‑quality questions.
    - Software demand is elastic: productivity gains fuel bigger builds, sustaining engineers; creative demand less elastic, hurting executors while directors rise.
    - AI tools increase throughput, expanding project scope and hiring for AI-literate staff — counterpoint: finance may prefer guaranteed savings via headcount cuts over riskier bets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI shifts work from execution to orchestration; leadership and AI infrastructure benefit; regulation-driven roles fall for policy reasons.
    - Impact: Upskill ICs to supervise AI; hire ML, data center, robotics; rebalance sales ops toward revenue architecture.
    - Watch next: Publish absolute volumes and longer baselines; measure scribe adoption vs postings; track CSR escalations vs bot containment.
