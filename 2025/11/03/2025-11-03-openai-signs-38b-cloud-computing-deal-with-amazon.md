# OpenAI signs $38B cloud computing deal with Amazon

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45799211) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/technology/openai-amazon-cloud-computing.html

- TL;DR
    - OpenAI will buy $38B of AWS compute over seven years, days after renegotiating its Microsoft pact to shop across clouds. It adds to deals with Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and broader plans for new data centers, as Big Tech’s AI capex soars. The Times flags bubble risks: OpenAI earns billions but isn’t profitable. HN debates whether OpenAI’s reported $1.4T compute “commitments” are payable options or binding liabilities, the cash burn versus stock-based financing, and futures ranging from Google-scale revenue to WeWork-style overreach.

- Comment pulse
    - Unsustainable obligations → $1.4T compute dwarfs ~$13–20B revenue; fast-depreciating assets need cash (e.g., power), not stock — counterpoint: staged over years, partly equity.
    - Optionality questions → Are these firm take-or-pay commitments or ceilings/options? If mostly options, headline totals overstate near-term liability.
    - Bubble vs scale thesis → Some see dot-com-style bust; others expect Google-level revenues via search displacement or productivity capture despite irrational markets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Multi-cloud hedges supply risk and pricing power; capacity pre-allocations and custom silicon roadmaps may matter more than headline deal sizes.
    - Impact: AWS gains marquee demand, justifying data-center and chip buildouts; Microsoft loses exclusivity leverage but still sells massive compute.
    - Watch next: Details on take-or-pay minimums, ramps, and financing mix; whether revenue run-rate and inference costs move toward positive unit economics.
