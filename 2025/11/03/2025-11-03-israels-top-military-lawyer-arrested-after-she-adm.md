- TL;DR
    - Israel’s military advocate general, Yifat Tomer‑Yerushalmi, was arrested after admitting she leaked video of soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee, saying it was to protect IDF investigators from far‑right attacks. The government framed the case as a PR disaster, intensifying threats against her. Critics say this undermines Israel’s rule‑of‑law posture and weakens its defense in international courts amid scant prosecutions for wartime abuses. HN commenters debate free‑press norms vs national image, whether lying to the court eclipses the leak, and whistleblowing ethics.

- Comment pulse
    - Free-press norms matter → concern Israel’s public prioritizes image over accountability — counterpoint: sentiment hasn’t changed; it’s always been like this.
    - Leadership frames scrutiny as PR damage → critics say “blood libel” rhetoric chills oversight and normalizes impunity over exposing confirmed abuse.
    - Rule-of-law breach focus → she lied and staged a disappearance; others call it justified whistleblowing, Snowden-like, prioritizing truth over institutional protection.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Shrinking domestic accountability weakens Israel’s complementarity defense at the ICC.
    - Impact: Chilling effect on military prosecutors, investigators, and future whistleblowers.
    - Watch next: Supreme Court actions, ICC filings, allies’ responses, and any concrete IDF detention reforms.
