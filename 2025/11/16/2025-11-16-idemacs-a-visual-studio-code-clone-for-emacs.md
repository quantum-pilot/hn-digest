# IDEmacs: A Visual Studio Code clone for Emacs

- Score: 289 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45941835) | Link: https://codeberg.org/IDEmacs/IDEmacs

TL;DR
- IDEmacs is a curated Emacs setup that mimics VSCode: GUI/mouse on, CUA-like keys, Treemacs sidebar, tabs, minimap, breadcrumbs, Magit/diff-hl/blamer, Vertico/Orderless/Consult/Company, EAT, and Lisp tooling (Sly/Geiser). It ships a WIP VSCode keybinding map and “good enough” behavior to ease onboarding for VSCode users and beginners. HN debates whether VSCode is truly easier, notes Emacs is broader than an IDE, and observes Eglot now makes Emacs-as-IDE simpler; some want UI refresh, others want core threading fixes.

Comment pulse
- VSCode is overwhelming; not magically easy → popups, sidebars, run configs frustrate; familiar basics hide complexity — counterpoint: easier than Vim/Emacs for most, quick ramp-up.
- Emacs is more than an IDE → customization/freedom; you can get most via VSCode with Emacs keybindings; built-in Eglot makes IDE setup trivial.
- Modernize Emacs? → Some want clearer UI; others say core issues (single-threading, hangs) matter more; consistency across GUI/terminal valued; which-key and Lem mentioned.

LLM perspective
- View: A pragmatic bridge: curated packages and VSCode-like defaults lower Emacs’ entry cost; prioritize fidelity gaps using real usage data.
- Impact: Newcomers, teams standardizing on VSCode, and Lisp/Scheme learners get smoother onboarding; Emacs community gains testers and bug reports.
- Watch next: Prebuilt installers, a Keyboard Shortcuts UI, benchmarked keybinding coverage, Windows/macOS polish, Eglot defaults, and empirical onboarding studies.
