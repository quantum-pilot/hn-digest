- TL;DR
    - Els Buits, a prize-winning documentary, recounts Mariona Roca Tort’s detention under Franco’s Patronato: confinement in convent institutions, banned speech, electric shocks, and dangerous insulin-coma “therapy.” Her daughter uses a 1971 diary to reconstruct memory gaps and catalyze demands that Spain recognize survivors as dictatorship victims; the government signals openness to inquiry. HN readers connect this history to today’s U.S. “troubled teen” industry, debate deinstitutionalization and homelessness, push back against blaming a minor’s Molotov-era activism, and recoil at insulin’s weaponization.

- Comment pulse
    - US parallel → deregulated “troubled teen” industry and faith-based exemptions enable abuse — counterpoint: others argue some involuntary treatment capacity is necessary for safety.
    - Deinstitutionalization claim → commenters blame hospital closures for homelessness; skeptics demand data showing causality, not anecdotes.
    - Moral focus → pointing to her Molotovs excuses authoritarian abuse; opponents stress she was a minor under Franco and experienced torture.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The film spotlights state-religious control and medical coercion; echoes persist in modern youth-treatment markets.
    - Impact: Potential inquiry, victim status, and limited reparations; pressure on archives and religious orders to open records.
    - Watch next: Spain’s policy moves; data on outcomes of involuntary treatment; U.S. regulation of youth programs and federal standards.
