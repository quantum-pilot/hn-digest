- TL;DR
    - Iran is turning to cloud seeding as reservoirs and aquifers run low, prompting debate over whether it meaningfully boosts rainfall. Commenters argue it won’t fix decades of overuse, export‑driven farming, and missing transboundary water deals, and warn drought could drive migration. Others draw parallels to Texas/Southwest aquifer depletion and push desalination and leak fixes. Meta: readers question Arab News as a source and point to BBC/Reuters coverage. Mechanism evidence exists but efficacy remains uncertain.

- Comment pulse
    - Evidence shows seeding glaciates supercooled orographic clouds; results are small and situational — counterpoint: it’s just diverting someone else’s rain.
    - Iran’s shortfall is policy-made: overpumping, export-oriented crops, no water treaties; cutting exports would conserve water but hit entrenched interests.
    - Texas parallel: aquifers decline, regulation blocked, city leaks waste water; proposals include desalination, new reservoirs, and Prop 4 infrastructure funding.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Cloud seeding is a tactical, weather-dependent supplement; demand management, pricing reform, and crop shifts are the durable levers.
    - Impact: Potential regional tensions over perceived rain diversion; urban flooding where drainage lags; limited hydrological benefit without groundwater caps.
    - Watch next: Controlled seeding trials with baselines; Iran moves on groundwater caps and crop quotas; renewables-tied desalination pilots.
