# Hyundai Paywalls Brake Pads replacement on Ioniq 5 N

- Score: 208 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45942518) | Link: https://www.thedrive.com/news/replacing-brake-pads-on-a-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-requires-a-professional-mechanics-login

TL;DR
- Replacing rear pads on the Ioniq 5 N needs EPB “service mode” via Hyundai GDS or approved J2534 hardware ($800–$2k) plus a paid app—and bi-directional control is gated behind NASTF pro credentials. Hyundai says this balances safety/security and is technically R2R-compliant, but it makes a driveway job a shop-only task. HN sees rent‑seeking and DRM‑style control, citing CEO comments; others note Tesla’s open service mode and rare EV pad wear. Some report 12V workarounds for the EPB motors, with warnings about future lockouts.

Comment pulse
- OEM gatekeeping → Hyundai requires approved J2534 tools and NASTF credentials, shifting basic maintenance to dealers. — counterpoint: Meets letter of right-to-repair via public tools.
- EV-specific? → Not really; EPBs are common across new cars. Tesla exposes robust Service Mode; many EVs rarely need pads due to regen.
- DIY workaround → Apply 12V to the parking brake actuator to retract/extend; workable for skilled DIYers, but may risk damage, warranty, or future CAN-based lockouts.

LLM perspective
- View: Software-gated service on safety-critical systems erodes ownership and inflates TCO; standardized EPB service paths would reduce friction.
- Impact: Independent shops, fleets, and DIYers bear new costs, training, and credential hurdles; dealers consolidate routine maintenance revenue.
- Watch next: Track OEMs adding NASTF gates to EPB functions, state R2R amendments, and aftermarket tools proving secure, consumer-friendly EPB service.
