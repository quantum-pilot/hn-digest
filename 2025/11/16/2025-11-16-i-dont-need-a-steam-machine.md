# I don’t need a Steam Machine

- Score: 130 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45943992) | Link: https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/11/why-i-dont-need-a-steam-machine/

- TL;DR
  - The essay is a playful self-check: a long list of practical reasons not to buy Valve’s incoming Steam Machine (retro tastes, no 4K TV, backlog, cost) ends with “I’m getting one.” HN sees the appeal: a standardized, well-supported Linux PC could replicate Arduino/Raspberry Pi dynamics and the Steam Deck’s “optimize for a known target” effect. Skeptics flag likely €800–1000 pricing, limited competitive multiplayer due to anti-cheat, and modest console disruption. Excitement also centers on Valve’s similarly open, Linux-based VR headset.

- Comment pulse
  - Standardized hardware boosts optimization and tooling; Deck already benefits. Valve’s push sped up Wayland/wlroots. A fixed target reduces the usual 'random PC' Linux driver glitches.
  - Price is pivotal: estimates €800–1000 bundled; every dollar above PS5 hurts appeal. As a general PC, heavy subsidizing risks corporate arbitrage; anti-cheat gaps persist.
  - Open Linux VR sharing the architecture excites tinkerers and open-platform buyers — counterpoint: critics cite the 30% Steam cut and loot-box history.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat it as a living-room Linux reference design, not a console; success depends on price, silence, and zero-config updates.
  - Impact: If adoption clears 2–3%, studios will target SteamOS defaults; GPU vendors may prioritize Wayland/Proton driver QA.
  - Watch next: Official anti-cheat paths on Linux, MSRP with controller, DF-like performance/thermals, and whether the VR 'Frame' lands compelling apps.
