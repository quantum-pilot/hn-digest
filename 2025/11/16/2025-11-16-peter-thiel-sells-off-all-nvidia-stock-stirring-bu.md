# Peter Thiel sells off all Nvidia stock, stirring bubble fears

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45948477) | Link: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/peter-thiel-dumps-top-ai-stock-stirring-bubble-fears

TL;DR
Peter Thiel’s latest 13F shows a full Nvidia exit (537k shares; ~40% of his book), cutting disclosed equities by two-thirds to $74.4M and rotating into Microsoft, Apple, and a smaller Tesla stake. He’s argued AI resembles 1999’s hype, despite Nvidia’s blowout results and $5T valuation. HN debates profit‑taking versus a bubble signal: tightening liquidity and gated funds vs. hyperscalers seen as safer platforms. SoftBank’s sales and the Gates Foundation trimming MSFT complicate the read; Thiel’s true exposure remains opaque.

Comment pulse
- Insider selling as sell signal → Thiel and SoftBank exits, fund gating and bank liquidity hint AI money tightening — counterpoint: SoftBank recycled capital into AI bets.
- Profit-taking vs conviction shift → Some see simple de-risking after huge gains; others claim he’s disavowing AI hype he previously amplified.
- Portfolio read-through → Adding MSFT/AAPL seen as safer hyperscaler platforms, despite Gates Foundation trimming MSFT; Oracle flagged as weak due to high leverage and bond discounts.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as risk management, not prophecy; diversify AI exposure across compute, platforms, and applications.
- Impact: Near-term multiple compression risk for AI hardware; hyperscalers, cash-rich incumbents may consolidate bargaining power.
- Watch next: Cloud capex guides, GPU pricing/lead times, financing strain in private credit, and large customer AI ROI disclosures.
