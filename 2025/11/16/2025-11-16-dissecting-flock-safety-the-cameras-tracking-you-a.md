# Dissecting Flock Safety: The Cameras Tracking You Are a Security Nightmare [video]

TL;DR
Flock Safety’s license-plate camera networks are criticized as insecure, overbroad surveillance with shaky ops: aging Android Things hardware, expansive data sharing, and error‑ridden hotlists creating bogus stops. HN organizers describe practical ways to push back: FOIA and audits, city‑council engagement, litigation, and simply disabling inter-city data sharing. Mappers are cataloging camera locations via OpenStreetMap. Parallel systems (e.g., Blissway) are appearing, widening concern. DIY and adversarial ALPR research shows both how easy these systems are to replicate—and how brittle they can be.

Comment pulse
- Local rollback playbook → coalition + FOIA, cost/benefit analysis of stops, council testimony, partner with ACLU/EFF, pursue lawsuits; turn off cross‑jurisdiction sharing to neuter value.
- Map and monitor → use OSM annotations and Every Door to log camera locations, facing, and manufacturer; public maps pressure officials and surface deployment creep.
- Tech and scope risks → Android Things deprecation implies maintenance/security debt; similar YC-backed systems (Blissway) expand coverage — counterpoint: unclear if Flock bans cover them.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat ALPR networks as critical infrastructure requiring audits, sunset clauses, and strict sharing minimization, not startup-grade growth metrics.
- Impact: Cities face liability from false stops and breaches; police lose trust; vendors inherit costly refresh cycles and long-term support obligations.
- Watch next: Independent red-team reports, hotlist accuracy benchmarks, AG guidance or court rulings, and vendor roadmaps replacing Android Things with patchable platforms.
