# I have recordings proving Coinbase knew about breach months before disclosure

- Score: 269 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45948058) | Link: https://jonathanclark.com/posts/coinbase-breach-timeline.html

- TL;DR
  - Author describes a Jan 7, 2025 phishing attempt where the caller knew his SSN and exact Coinbase balance; he sent Coinbase detailed evidence that day. Coinbase later disclosed in mid‑May a contractor-enabled data leak (TaskUs), costing $180–$400M. The author argues Coinbase knew months earlier; HN cites Reuters saying Coinbase was aware by January. Discussion splits between “timeline gap signals negligence” and “recording doesn’t prove prior knowledge,” with broader concern over outsourcing and excessive support access.

- Comment pulse
  - Coinbase knew earlier → Reuters/SEC references suggest January awareness of a contractor leak; aligns with author’s Jan 7 report.
  - Skeptics: recording proves only phishing → Knowledge claim unproven; user may have leaked data — counterpoint: Coinbase acknowledged the report; contractor breach later confirmed.
  - Root cause focus → Outsourcing and over-privileged support access enabled data exposure; weak ops culture cited via anecdotes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Insider-enabled data leak fueling targeted social engineering; timeline dispute hinges on disclosure thresholds versus early signals.
  - Impact: Customers face tailored scams; Coinbase faces regulatory scrutiny (SEC cyber rules), vendor controls audits, and potential class actions.
  - Watch next: Audit details on TaskUs access, Coinbase’s least-privilege redesign, detection KPIs, and regulatory findings on incident materiality and disclosure timing.
