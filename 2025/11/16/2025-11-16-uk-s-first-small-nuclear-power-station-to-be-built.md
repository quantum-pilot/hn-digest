- TL;DR
    - The UK will build its first SMR plant at Wylfa, Anglesey: three Rolls‑Royce 470 MWe reactors, work starting next year, targeting mid‑2030s output, backed by £2.5bn via Great British Energy‑Nuclear, promising ~3,000 jobs and power for ~3m homes. Supporters cite energy security and industrial strategy; critics flag unresolved waste storage and renewables’ lower costs. HN debates SMR practicality (470 MWe isn’t “small”), long timelines, and whether nuclear’s system reliability beats renewables plus vast storage, while dismissing claims of a hidden naval subsidy.

- Comment pulse
    - Renewables cheaper per kWh → but week-long wind lulls need tens of TWh storage, raising system cost — counterpoint: batteries suit intraday; mix still required.
    - RR ‘SMR’ is 470 MWe, conventional PWR; no prototype yet, so mid‑2030s is optimistic; SMRs often grow and lose modular advantages.
    - SMRs as naval subsidy? Skeptics say yes; practitioners say tech, teams, and funding are separate. Drone-era security risks raised — counterpoint: renewables face grid threats.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Benefits hinge on serial manufacturing and regulatory streamlining; one-off projects won’t realize SMR cost or schedule promises.
    - Impact: Anchors UK nuclear supply chain and jobs; hedges winter reliability; may strain budgets if delays push financing costs higher.
    - Watch next: final contracts and financing terms; ONR licensing; factory build dates; waste repository siting; benchmarks against Hinkley/Sizewell and BWRX‑300.
