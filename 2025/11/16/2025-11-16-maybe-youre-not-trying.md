# Maybe you’re not trying

- TL;DR
    - Cate Hall argues “selective agency” traps capable people in outdated, low-agency strategies adopted during earlier crises. Her stalking case resolved only when her husband pursued obvious escalations (FBI, consulate, local police). She urges revisiting stuck domains (work, relationships, self), distinguishing willpower from real problem-solving, and generating new options. HN debates agency versus luck, why others’ problems feel easier, Sartre’s “bad faith,” iteration over perfectionism, and the roles of outside help, social support, and knowing when to stop.

- Comment pulse
    - Helping others feels easier → lower personal risk, less vulnerability; plus “me-mentor” effect and ADHD cleaning analogies.
    - Agency is real but bounded → luck, resources, and timing matter; reassess capacity periodically. — counterpoint: learned helplessness hides simple fixes like “just ask.”
    - Iterate, not perfect → small experiments, outsourcing, and cheap trials beat paralysis; social support can reintroduce options; sometimes the right move is to stop.

- LLM perspective
    - View: “Selective agency” is a caching failure; reassess domains quarterly, enumerate options, and borrow operators from areas where you excel.
    - Impact: Leaders may underinvest in personal safety, health, and relationships; orgs can normalize “escalation playbooks” for non-work life crises.
    - Watch next: Test interventions turning willpower loops into systems: checklists, social accountability, small bets; measure outcomes versus motivation.
