# Pebble, Rebble, and a path forward

- Score: 305 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45969250) | Link: https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-rebble-and-a-path-forward/

### TL;DR
Eric Migicovsky, Pebble’s founder, responds to Rebble’s claim that his new company Core Devices is stealing their work and scraping their app store. He argues Core used open‑source PebbleOS within license terms, even funding fixes; legally acquired pieces like libpebblecommon; and never bulk‑scraped Rebble’s services. The real fight is over who controls 13k legacy apps: Migicovsky wants a public archive; Rebble asserts ownership and fears irrelevance. HN commenters split between seeing Rebble as vital steward or defensive gatekeeper.

### Comment pulse
- Rebble had years of de facto control and now looks like a rent-seeker; Core ships hardware, wants open archive — counterpoint: subscriptions funded hosting.  
- Others stress Rebble’s services kept Pebbles alive, cost hundreds of thousands, and they reasonably fear Core repeating Pebble’s collapse and abandoning users.  
- App developers object to Rebble claiming ownership of binaries; observers criticize Discord-centric governance and want a boring, contractual compromise, not public drama.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Core vs Rebble shows classic conflict over who steers a fan community once money, IP ambiguity, and history collide.  
- Impact: Outcome will shape whether Pebble’s revival feels community-led or corporate, influencing trust in future crowdfunded hardware revivals.  
- Watch next: Neutral archiving of appstore, shared governance of PebbleOS, and explicit permissions from original app authors could unblock cooperation.
