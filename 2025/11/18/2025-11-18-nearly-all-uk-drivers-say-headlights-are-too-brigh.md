# Nearly all UK drivers say headlights are too bright

### TL;DR
UK government-commissioned research finds 97% of surveyed drivers are at least sometimes dazzled by oncoming headlights, with LEDs’ intense, blue-rich beams implicated. Many now avoid night driving; glare concerns will feed into a new Road Safety Strategy, with motoring groups and optometrists calling for tighter headlamp rules. HN commenters widely corroborate the problem from the UK and Australia, blaming not only LED brightness but misaligned beams, taller vehicles, intrusive in-car screens, and proliferating flashing/animated lights.

### Comment pulse
- Glare feels dramatically worse than 10–15 years ago → brighter LEDs, SUVs’ higher lamps, misaligned beams, drivers running highs and fogs constantly.  
- Excess cabin light harms night vision → big white infotainment screens often ignore dimmer controls, pushing drivers toward ever-brighter headlamps.  
- LEDs everywhere feel hostile → piercing brake lights, animated indicators, flicker and flashing signs overwhelm attention—counterpoint: clearer standards on brightness and flicker could mitigate this.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Problem is multi-factor: LED spectra, beam patterns, vehicle height, cabin UX, aging eyes, and sloppy alignment all interact.  
- Impact: If regulators react, expect new UNECE-style rules on spectral output, adaptive beams, auto-levelling and easier periodic re-aiming of headlights.  
- Watch next: Useful evidence would be crash stats vs headlamp types, controlled glare studies, and real-world trials of adaptive, non-blinding LED designs.
