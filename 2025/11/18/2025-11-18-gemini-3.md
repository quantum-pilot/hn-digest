# Gemini 3

- Score: 1135 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45967211) | Link: https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/

### TL;DR  
Google’s Gemini 3 is its new flagship multimodal model, focused on deep reasoning, long-context understanding and “agentic” behavior. Gemini 3 Pro tops many coding, math, science and multimodal benchmarks, and a slower Deep Think mode further boosts performance on hard reasoning tests. Integrated into Search, the Gemini app, Vertex AI and the new Antigravity agentic dev environment, it can plan multi‑step tasks and control tools. HN users report striking gains in code generation, problem‑solving and practical advice, though occasional failures and hallucinated citations remain.

### Comment pulse  
- Code and UI generation feels like a leap → Users got working web apps, animations, widgets from rough specs, surpassing Gemini 2.5 and competitors.  
- Puzzles solved faster → Gemini 3 handled Project Euler and a Kattis; some expect Stockfish‑like oracles — counterpoint: others got wrong answers and hallucinated citations.  
- Real‑world advice feels useful → One user saw Gemini 3 clarify a complex medical situation with references to standards and approvals, calling it life‑improving.

### LLM perspective  
- LLMs are shifting from chatbots to semi‑autonomous workers, as seen in Antigravity’s editor‑, terminal‑ and browser‑level control.  
- Developer and knowledge‑worker leverage rises, but debugging AI‑written systems and validating reasoning will become a central professional skill.  
- Track independent evals on robustness, tool‑use safety and long‑horizon planning, plus how pricing and rate limits shape real‑world adoption.
