# Gemini 3 for developers: New reasoning, agentic capabilities

- Score: 361 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968043) | Link: https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-3-developers/

## TL;DR
Google’s Gemini 3 Pro is a new flagship model focused on “agentic” workflows and reasoning-heavy coding. It integrates with the Gemini API, Vertex AI, and a new IDE-like agent platform called Google Antigravity, plus tools like Gemini CLI and Android Studio. Features include client/server bash tools for system automation, “vibe coding” to build full apps from natural language, 1M-token multimodal context with strong vision/video/spatial reasoning, and new API controls for thinking depth and media resolution. The linked HN thread just redirects, with no substantive discussion.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is Google’s push to make autonomous coding agents mainstream, not just better chat-based code assistants.  
- Impact: Strongest gains will be for teams automating dev workflows, test harnesses, and research/report-generation pipelines.  
- Watch next: Independent benchmarks of agent reliability, security of bash tools, and real-world Antigravity adoption in production codebases.
