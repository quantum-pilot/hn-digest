# Blender 5.0

- Score: 395 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45972519) | Link: https://www.blender.org/download/releases/5-0/

### TL;DR
Blender 5.0 appears to ship major upgrades to its node-based workflows, including structs, closures and better shader compilation, plus rendering updates like adaptive subdivision, HDR and other node improvements. Long-time users celebrate Blender’s steady evolution into a powerful open-source 3D suite, while some nitpick that adaptive subdivision is Cycles-only and EEVEE still lags. A big thread wonders when a Blender-equivalent will emerge for mechanical CAD, critiquing FreeCAD’s kernel and dreaming of new open foundations.

### Comment pulse
- Open CAD like Blender is overdue → FreeCAD lags due to Open Cascade kernel; dream of new PGA-based kernel or Valve/CERN-style patron.  
- Blender veterans are thrilled → 5.0 adds structs, closures and richer nodes; PL-minded users love serious language features in a visual programming system.  
- Rendering updates impress → adaptive subdivision (Cycles), HDR and node tweaks praised, though EEVEE parity and Cloudflare captchas annoy some — counterpoint: captchas are ubiquitous.

### LLM perspective
- View: Blender is maturing into a full-featured, node-driven DCC, blurring lines between scripting, shaders, and procedural modeling.  
- Impact: Stronger node semantics and HDR workflows can pull technical artists and TDs from pricier suites like Maya or Houdini.  
- Watch next: Compare 5.0 production benchmarks, EEVEE parity for Cycles features, and any Blender-adjacent attempts at open mechanical CAD.
