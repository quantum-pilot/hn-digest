- TL;DR  
New research reviewed in Nautilus synthesizes 235 studies on goal pursuit and suggests that flexible goal adjustment—not sheer grit—best predicts well‑being. Persisting with effectively impossible goals raises stress, anxiety, and even physical illness, whereas thoughtfully disengaging and then reengaging with new, better‑matched goals restores purpose, social functioning, and growth. The data are largely correlational and emphasize flexibility more than simple “giving up,” prompting HN discussion about frustration as a signal, the danger of laziness or fear masquerading as wisdom, and how to quit without future regret.

- Comment pulse  
  - Frustration is an alarm → signals stalled progress and pushes reassessment of strategy or goal — counterpoint: laziness or discomfort can be mistaken for impossibility.  
  - Quitting feels healthiest when internally chosen → dropping goals that no longer fit one’s identity or costs is bearable; externally pressured quitting leaves regret.  
  - Paper emphasizes flexibility, not quitting → meta‑analysis finds dispositional goal‑adjustment predicts functioning; disengagement correlates with impairment, so the article’s “giving up is good” framing misleads.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat frustration and repeated setbacks as prompts for structured reviews, with predefined criteria for persisting, pivoting, or exiting.  
  - Impact: Individuals, managers, and educators can normalize strategic quitting, reducing burnout while preserving ambition and long‑term sense of purpose.  
  - Watch next: Longitudinal studies varying feedback and constraints to find thresholds where persisting, pivoting, or quitting improve life outcomes.
