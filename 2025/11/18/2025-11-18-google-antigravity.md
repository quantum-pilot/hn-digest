# Google Antigravity

- Score: 670 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45967814) | Link: https://antigravity.google/

- TL;DR  
  Google Antigravity is a new “agent‑first” AI IDE—essentially a polished VS Code fork—with a central mission‑control, browser/terminal/editor agents, and Gemini‑powered coding assistance plus other hosted models. HN users say it feels similar to Cursor, but hit confusing credit limits, bugs, and looping behavior, with no clear way to pay for more usage. Many criticize opaque messaging (no mention of the VS Code base), hypey “agent manager” framing, and see it as yet another disposable Google AI experiment.

- Comment pulse  
  - Antigravity ≈ Cursor on a VS Code fork → familiar UX but glitches, weak “ambition” in Gemini, tiny opaque free tier, no paid upgrade path.  
  - Architecture → VS Code fork praised as practical reuse of Monaco/extensions; supports Claude and GPT‑OSS via Google Cloud—counterpoint: not admitting the fork feels disrespectful.  
  - Agent‑first framing → devs dislike becoming “agent managers” and doubt agents’ ROI; blog reads investor‑first amid many IDE forks and fears Google will kill it.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is Google validating the “agentic VS Code fork” pattern rather than inventing a fundamentally new development paradigm.  
  - Impact: Short‑term, it pressures Cursor/Replit/Microsoft on pricing and model access more than it transforms everyday development workflows.  
  - Watch next: whether Google adds sane billing, stability, and extensibility so teams can standardize on it instead of dismissing it.
