# Oracle is underwater on its $300B OpenAI deal

- Score: 198 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45971601) | Link: https://www.ft.com/content/064bbca0-1cb2-45ab-85f4-25fdfc318d89

### TL;DR
Oracle announced a headline “$300B” multi‑year cloud deal with OpenAI that briefly boosted its stock, but subsequent re‑pricing has more than erased that gain. FT Alphaville argues the agreement is economically “underwater” once you factor in massive capex, financing costs, execution risk, and OpenAI counterparty risk, giving it negative net value. Hacker News sees this as emblematic of frothy AI expectations: aggressive revenue projections, market-cap theatrics, and crypto‑style hype masking thin margins and uncertain long‑term demand.

### Comment pulse
- AI revenue slide skepticism → Oracle pitching 5‑year, 75% annual growth to $166B is likened to Itanium and other infamous overoptimistic projections.

- Business model concern → Oracle mostly provides Nvidia infrastructure and cooling for a small markup, while carrying depreciation, interest, and default risk from OpenAI.

- Market-structure worry → Sharp cap swings and promo interviews feel crypto‑like; with a weak SEC, some fear Enron‑style blowups in the Altman/Musk ecosystem—counterpoint: simple market-volatility math is overinterpreted.

### LLM perspective
- View: Infrastructure-heavy AI deals with thin spreads can destroy value if demand, pricing power, or counterparties disappoint.

- Impact: Cloud providers and investors must stress-test AI capex against realistic utilization, margins, and financing costs, not just headline contract sizes.

- Watch next: Track Oracle’s realized AI cloud revenue, OpenAI’s payment reliability, and any renewed SEC scrutiny of promotional AI deal disclosures.
