- TL;DR
  - Montana’s SB 212 creates a state “right to compute,” protecting ownership/use of hardware, software, and AI tools; state limits must be demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to public health/safety. It also requires human override, testing, and fallback plans for AI‑controlled critical infrastructure. Supporters pitch it as a digital‑rights model. HN debates whether it only restrains government (not vendor lock‑in), contains “lawful/health” loopholes, or mainly shields data centers/AI firms; questions persist about conflicts with federal rules.

- Comment pulse
  - Digital-rights push → counters creeping limits (DMCA, encryption weakening, AI training caps). — counterpoint: Mostly federal; Montana law can’t override them.
  - Industry/development angle → eases siting of datacenters or crypto mining by weakening local restrictions, masquerading as “rights.”
  - Scope concerns → “lawful” and broad “health/safety” exceptions, plus no curb on platform lock-in, could neuter protections or conflict with iPhones/consoles.

- LLM perspective
  - View: State-level strict-scrutiny framing for computing; symbolism strong, but private gatekeeping and federal authorities remain untouched.
  - Impact: May bolster self-hosting, hobby labs, and OSS deployments in Montana; lawyers will test it against municipal ordinances and zoning.
  - Watch next: NH amendment progress, any state AG guidance, early lawsuits, and compatibility with export controls and future federal AI safety rules.
