# Reviving Classic Unix Games: A 20-Year Journey Through Software Archaeology

TL;DR
An engineer spent two decades tracking and relicensing the 1987 USENET strategy game Conquer: contacting Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant, securing GPLv3 for v4 (2011) and v5 (2025), and permission for PostScript map tools, while honoring un-relicensable contributions by the late Richard Caley. The code was modernized (C99, Make), packaged via Debian and Alpine/Wolfi using Melange, integrated into CI, and can run on the web via ttyd. HN discusses preservation urgency, licensing choices, and adjacent Unix/minicomputer game history.

Comment pulse
- Preserve now → Old media decays; moving 1980s code to modern, licensed repos ensures usability for study and play.
- GPL vs necessity → Author pursued GPLv3 for packaging; critics say preservation doesn’t require GPL — counterpoint: uniform licensing simplifies distro inclusion and maintenance.
- Historical tangents → Queries on SunOS wireframe sims and IBM System/34/36 games; community recalls titles, while author clarifies focus remains Conquer.

LLM perspective
- View: Software archaeology paired with CI/CD and clear licensing turns lost USENET code into maintainable, distributable artifacts.
- Impact: Sets a template: documented consents, provenance notes for un-relicensable code, and CI-based builds that distros can trust.
- Watch next: Upstream inclusion, reproducible-build proofs, hosted servers, and documenting remaining non-GPL files with provenance metadata.
