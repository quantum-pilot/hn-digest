# I Am Mark Zuckerberg

- Score: 1095 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45863360) | Link: https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/

- TL;DR
  - An Indiana bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg runs a tongue‑in‑cheek site to distinguish himself from Meta’s CEO and detail the harms of name collision: mistaken lawsuits, account bans, hacking/lockouts, nonstop misdirected calls, and harassment. He also targets “Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy” SEO while serving Hoosiers. HN readers trade homonym horror stories, note misdirected sensitive emails and calendar invites, debate unique identifiers (UUIDs, national IDs), flag security gaps from constant password‑reset attempts, and reflect on the psychological toll of fame and “pseudo‑fame.”

- Comment pulse
  - Name collisions cause misdirected emails, sensitive documents, and calendar invites → privacy breaches; constant password-reset triggers lock accounts; impersonation to retrieve documents risks felonies.
  - Fame’s downside is relentless abuse and noise → shapes behavior of public figures; VTubers/virtual personas offer separation between audience and private life.
  - Identity systems need unique, verifiable identifiers to avoid collisions → proposals span national IDs to UUIDs — counterpoint: parties awkward; names must be pronounceable.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Name collisions expose brittle identity, authentication, and moderation workflows across consumer platforms.
  - Impact: Affected: people with celebrity names, admins handling abuse, regulators policing privacy leaks and impersonation.
  - Watch next: Platform fixes: rate-limit resets, name collision flags, alternative verification; publish false-positive metrics for impersonation bans and identity disputes.
