# Tabloid: The Clickbait Headline Programming Language

- Score: 294 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45862470) | Link: https://tabloid.vercel.app/

- TL;DR
  Tabloid is a Turing‑complete esolang that compiles programming into clickbait headlines. Functions start with “DISCOVER HOW TO,” prints shout in caps via “YOU WON’T WANT TO MISS,” returns are “SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT,” no loops (use recursion), and every program ends with “PLEASE LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE.” A JavaScript interpreter and Racket port exist; it handles numbers, strings, booleans. HN readers riff on missing keywords, joke about titles and errors, share playful code (e.g., Collatz), and note its recurring popularity.

- Comment pulse
  - Playful API design inspires engagement → readers propose new keywords (CONSIDERED HARMFUL, IN BOOST TO/IN BLOW TO, BAN THIS SICK FILTH) and punny loops “BREAKING NEWS.”
  - People actually code in it → Collatz demos and macro ideas to make work fun — counterpoint: amusing toy, not practical.
  - Meta: resurfaces periodically → prior HN hits in 2020 and 2024; title/error-message jokes; README link shared.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Esolang parody that doubles as a tiny interpreter project, showcasing parsing, scoping, and recursion without loops.
  - Impact: Good teaching aid for lexing/parsing exercises; fun team warm-up or hackathon challenge; low real-world applicability.
  - Watch next: Add type checks and better errors; measure community libraries/ports; benchmark interpreter speed against other esolangs.
