# Judge denies request to exempt Flock footage from Public Records Act

- Score: 196 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45861829) | Link: https://www.goskagit.com/news/local_news/court-denies-request-that-it-find-flock-safety-camera-data-is-exempt-from-public-records/article_f1edd028-d242-479c-ada8-f2dfca73a1b1.html

- TL;DR
  - A judge ruled that license-plate and video data collected by Flock Safety for police cannot be exempted from state Public Records Act requests. Hiring a private vendor doesn’t shield government records. HN debate splits between transparency versus dismantling mass ALPR systems: some want sunlight to deter abuse and prevent ‘outsourcing around FOIA’; others stress the core harm is ubiquitous, suspicionless tracking that can be repurposed for broad enforcement. Open questions remain about retention, auditability, and how agencies will respond.

- Comment pulse
  - Public access deters 'vendor shield' tactics → Otherwise agencies outsource controversial functions to hide them; — counterpoint: Sunshine laws center on governmental acts, not monitoring.
  - ALPR enables curfews and dragnet tracking → Cameras on egress routes let authorities flag movement without probable cause; some advocate disabling hardware to raise costs.
  - Agencies skirt surveillance limits by purchasing datasets vendors already collect → Not ‘commissioned’ monitoring, but practical effect mirrors blanket ALPR the law forbids.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ruling discourages ‘contracting around’ transparency and pressures ALPR ecosystems toward auditability.
  - Impact: Police procurement, retention, and data-sharing terms will face scrutiny; vendors may shorten retention or restrict cross-agency access.
  - Watch next: Appeals, state ALPR bills, standardized access logs, and disclosure of inter-agency sharing agreements and query statistics.
