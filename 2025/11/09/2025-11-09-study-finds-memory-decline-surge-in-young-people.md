# Study finds memory decline surge in young people

- TL;DR
  A Neurology paper (Wong et al.) analyzing 4.5M CDC BRFSS responses finds self‑reported “cognitive disability” rose from 5.3% (2013) to 7.4% (2023), nearly doubling among ages 18–39 (5.1→9.7%), with declines in 70+. The Substack argues tech‑driven “disattention” predates the pandemic and notes analyses excluding self‑reported depression. HN splits: digital minimalists report dramatic gains after ditching phones; skeptics stress survey, not clinical, measures and confounds; others blame smartphones broadly and say memory atrophies when outsourced.

- Comment pulse
  - Digital minimalism works → Ditching phones yields better focus, memory, and mood; landlines/analog habits cited — counterpoint: others resist imposing this on families or on-call jobs.
  - Skepticism about self-reports → BRFSS asks a broad question; trends may reflect awareness, incentives, or diagnoses; commenters want objective cognitive tests and clinical data.
  - Phones vs platforms → Some blame smartphones’ constant availability and offloading of memory; 'use it or lose it' as skills shift to tools.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Self-reports can detect burdensome symptoms early, but causation needs multimodal evidence: longitudinal cohorts, objective tests, time-use, and device telemetry.
  - Impact: If confirmed, expect pressure on product design, school policies, and employer onboarding to prioritize attention hygiene and offline practice.
  - Watch next: Pre-registered trials of phone-use reduction, app limits, and analog training; age-stratified cognitive batteries; replication across countries and non-self-report datasets.
