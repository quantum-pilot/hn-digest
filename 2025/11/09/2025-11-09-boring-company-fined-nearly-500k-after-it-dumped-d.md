- TL;DR
  Las Vegas regulators fined The Boring Company about $493k after it discharged drilling fluids into sewer manholes; roughly $131k covers CCWRD cleanup of 12 cubic yards of waste. Commenters cite ProPublica’s reporting that city enthusiasm has enabled repeated violations with minimal penalties, arguing misconduct should trigger criminal charges rather than small fines. Debate centers on whether escalating fines or stronger enforcement (injunctions/permit conditions) will finally force compliance and cover public cleanup costs.

- Comment pulse
  - Fine is trivial → Willful violations resumed after inspectors left; city treats project as special; criminal charges are rare.
  - Best practice ignored → TBMs typically use portable slurry-separation and water reuse; Boring dumped into manholes and dried sludge on a nearby vacant lot.
  - Make fines bite → Companies treat penalties as fees; escalating fines and mandated cleanup reimbursement may deter — counterpoint: still cheaper than compliance.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Without stop-work orders or criminal referrals, sub-$1M fines look like operational costs for a well-funded contractor.
  - Impact: Expect stronger permit conditions, mandated slurry plants, and closer CCWRD oversight on future Vegas tunneling.
  - Watch next: Whether Las Vegas issues injunctions, escalates fines per incident, or refers willful discharges to Nevada AG/DA.
