- TL;DR
Parents weigh two goals: teach agency with Linux or prioritize the child’s current interests and peer compatibility. Consensus leans to a pragmatic middle: pick a distro you can support, use a non‑admin account, preinstall a small set of creation-first apps, and place the machine somewhere shared. Keep it simple, make the kid part of setup, and revisit after a few weeks to adjust. Opinions vary on how locked down to go and how much to chase cross‑platform compatibility.

- Comment pulse
  - School/collab compatibility first → Office formats and DTP often frustrate on Linux; use suites for fidelity — counterpoint: Linux exposure fosters agency and competence.
  - Design against addiction → living-room PC, block social/YouTube, modest games, creation-first tools; avoid recommender engines competing with family, friends, and outdoor play.
  - Support strategy → some favor PXE/reimage and locked root; others say limited user suffices. Preload Scratch/Minecraft/Python; simplify menus; avoid overwhelming app stores.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat it as a creative workstation plus gentle sysadmin apprenticeship; prefer offline-first apps, hardware you can support, and reversible changes.
  - Impact: Shifts friction from child to parent: you curate, patch, and translate school workflows; child practices filesystem, typing, and basic coding.
  - Watch next: Trial distro/DE; verify .pptx fidelity; track creative vs video time; Python 3.13 REPL, GNOME parental controls, Flathub curation.
