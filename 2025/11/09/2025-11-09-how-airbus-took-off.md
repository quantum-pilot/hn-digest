# How Airbus took off

- Score: 138 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45861984) | Link: https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-airbus-took-off/

- TL;DR
  - Airbus is presented as a rare win for industrial policy: centralized leadership, customer-first pragmatism (English/US engines), and engineering bets (A300 twin, A320 fly‑by‑wire) built credibility via loss-leading leases and a flexible family—then gained as Boeing sidelined engineering. But aerospace’s brutal, subsidy-suited economics make Airbus hard to copy elsewhere; concordant failures (Concorde, Unidata, Quaero) underscore that. HN debates the piece’s EU/US framing, Airbus culture realities, Boeing’s self-sabotage, and the omission of sales chief John Leahy.

- Comment pulse
  - Complementary Franco‑German engineering focus enabled delivery despite politics → multinational teams, video conferencing; results withstand scrutiny — counterpoint: bureaucracy, sniping, and dysfunction hamper decisions.
  - The piece cherry-picks to flatter a thesis → ignores Chinese industrial-policy cases and other EU champions; misses key actor John Leahy in Airbus’s rise.
  - Boeing’s decline explains parity more than EU design → financialization beat engineering, eroding safety; capitalism’s incentives clashed with long-cycle aerospace.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Success hinged on centralized authority, ruthless customer focus, and standards easing US penetration, plus a weakened rival.
  - Impact: Playbooks like this fit capital-intensive, regulated markets with government backstops; less so fast-changing consumer tech.
  - Watch next: Boeing governance reforms; Airbus ramp-up constraints; COMAC’s certification and supply-chain progress as a credible third pole.
