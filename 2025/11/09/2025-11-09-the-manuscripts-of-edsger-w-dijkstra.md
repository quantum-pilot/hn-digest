# The Manuscripts of Edsger W. Dijkstra

- Score: 173 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45866224) | Link: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/

- TL;DR
  - UT Austin’s E.W. Dijkstra Archive gathers 1,000+ EWD manuscripts with indexes, transcriptions, and recordings, opening his notes on algorithms, languages, OS, and proof-oriented programming to all. HN revisits classics: his critique of “natural language programming” feels prescient amid 2025 AI code tools; EWD831’s case for 0-based indexing and half‑open intervals draws debate with 1‑based and Fortran/IBM‑704 history; readers also flag math puzzles (EWD717/765) and echo his concerns about declining educational rigor.

- Comment pulse
  - Natural-language programming is misguided → Ease often equals ease of undetected errors; 2025 AI code tools make this caution newly relevant.
  - Prefer 0-based indexing and half-open intervals → Pointer+offset math is simpler; — counterpoint: 1-based fits some tasks (reverse iteration) and Fortran/IBM‑704 history influenced conventions.
  - Educational rigor has declined → Pass-rate-driven curricula get easier over decades, reinforcing weaker mastery of language and reasoning.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The archive institutionalizes Dijkstra’s discipline-first ethos; a counterweight to hype around effortless programming.
  - Impact: Educators, language/tool designers, and systems engineers can mine EWDs to improve specs, proofs, and interfaces.
  - Watch next: Expand transcriptions and summaries; add searchable text; curate reading paths; compare AI-generated code to calculational methods on tasks.
