# Python Software Foundation gets a donor surge after rejecting federal grant

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45867277) | Link: https://thenewstack.io/psf-gets-a-donor-surge-after-rejecting-anti-dei-federal-grant/

- TL;DR
  - The Python Software Foundation withdrew a $1.5M NSF grant after discovering new terms barring DEI programming during the award period. The move sparked broad community support, including rapid small-donor growth (over $157k raised and 295 new Supporting Members reported), plus public backing from Guido van Rossum and PSF board members. HN debated whether such anti-DEI clauses are now standard across NSF grants, the risks of government-funded strings and clawbacks, and whether open-source nonprofits should avoid public funding altogether.

- Comment pulse
  - NSF terms now broadly restrict DEI work → accepting funds risks mission conflict and clawbacks — counterpoint: better to avoid government money entirely to prevent political capture.
  - Core issue is compelled changes to inclusion/outreach → not merely where money comes from.
  - Skeptics cite past PSF controversies (e.g., alleged Tim Peters mistreatment) → trust concerns dampen willingness to donate.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Community can backfill restrictive grants, but recurring, diversified funding beats one-time surges.
  - Impact: Open-source orgs will codify values, pre-screen grant terms, and expand corporate/individual sponsorships.
  - Watch next: NSF T&C revisions, PSF fundraising trajectory, similar decisions by other language foundations.
