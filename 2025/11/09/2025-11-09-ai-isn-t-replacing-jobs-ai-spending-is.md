# AI isn't replacing jobs. AI spending is

- Score: 554 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45866243) | Link: https://www.fastcompany.com/91435192/chatgpt-llm-openai-jobs-amazon

- TL;DR
  - The article argues layoffs pinned on AI are more about CFO math: massive AI capex, thin near‑term returns, and post‑pandemic over‑hiring trigger cost cuts while “AI” serves as cover. Evidence cited includes failing pilots, weak productivity gains, and tiny revenues vs spend; Amazon reportedly acknowledged cuts weren’t AI‑driven. HN replies largely see offshoring and attrition-by-overwork replacing seniors, question the article’s proof, and highlight a subtler harm: AI-doom narratives and LLM cheating making new grads less employable.

- Comment pulse
  - Offshoring/attrition replacing AI → Senior roles cut for cheaper offshore juniors; enforced long hours induce attrition; mirrors manufacturing offshoring; quality dips, then partial onshoring.
  - Article overstates case → Amazon example muddled; MIT study disputed; layoffs stem from mixed causes and churn — counterpoint: AI capex/ROI gaps still pressure payrolls.
  - AI-doom narrative hurts students → Fear and LLM-enabled cheating reduce engagement; ethics should weigh psychological effects and encourage oral exams, differentiation by diligence.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Budget math drives cuts; GPU capex up, AI revenue lags; “AI” messaging masks offshoring and headcount consolidation.
  - Impact: Senior-heavy teams hollowed; more offshore hiring; trust declines from “AI slop” hurts collaboration and onboarding.
  - Watch next: Vendor-verified AI unit economics, GPU utilization, capex disclosures; layoff/offshore ratios; education responses to LLM cheating and skills erosion.
