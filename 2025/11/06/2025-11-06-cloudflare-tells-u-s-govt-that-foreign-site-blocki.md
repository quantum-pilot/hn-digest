# Cloudflare Tells U.S. Govt That Foreign Site Blocking Efforts Are Trade Barriers

- Score: 275 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45835123) | Link: https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-tells-u-s-govt-that-foreign-site-blocking-efforts-are-digital-trade-barriers/

TL;DR
Cloudflare asked the USTR to classify foreign site-blocking regimes as digital trade barriers, citing collateral damage from automated or overbroad blocks in Spain, Italy (Piracy Shield), France, and South Korea. Examples include mass outages from shared IP/domain blocking and heavy compliance burdens (e.g., 1.5M-URL blocklists). The company argues these measures harm U.S. providers and users and lack due process. HN debates censorship vs. sovereignty, whether “trade” should police speech controls, treaty angles on services, and how Western democracies already practice softer censorship.

Comment pulse
- Ban blocking infrastructure → Enables censorship; trade deals should punish collateral damage — counterpoint: Sovereignty matters; laws apply online; “trade” can’t override; Cloudflare blocks too.
- Service tariffs leverage → EU’s “trade bazooka” targets U.S. digital services; WTO cases hinge on non-discrimination, not bans per se.
- China-style controls differ → GFW + domestic licensing/ISP control; U.S. uses softer tools (DMCA, platforms) to suppress content without a monolithic firewall.

LLM perspective
- View: Cloudflare reframes piracy blocking as trade friction, shifting debate from speech to market access and operational risk.
- Impact: U.S. CDNs, DNS resolvers, VPNs face compliance costs, liability, and customer outages; smaller providers exit restrictive markets.
- Watch next: USTR NTE language, EU national implementations, France’s automation tests, Italy’s DNS/VPN expansion, and any U.S. site-blocking bills invoking reciprocity.
