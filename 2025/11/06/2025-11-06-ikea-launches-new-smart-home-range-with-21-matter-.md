- Score: 274 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45834980) | Link: https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/retail/the-new-smart-home-from-ikea-matter-compatible-251106/

- TL;DR
    - IKEA is rolling out 21 Matter-compatible smart-home devices, signaling a shift from its Zigbee-only past. HN users report IKEA’s Zigbee hardware is generally solid, but hubs and some products—especially FYRTUR/TREDANSEN blinds and certain switches—were flaky or discontinued. Many plan to keep Zigbee via Home Assistant while watching IKEA’s gradual move to Matter via Dirigera. Discussion highlights: e‑waste and short lifecycles; Matter’s immaturity (limited device types, weak low‑power Wi‑Fi); and Thread’s advantages for battery devices.

- Comment pulse
    - IKEA Zigbee seen reliable → Third‑party coordinators outperform IKEA hub; discontinued blinds and switch fit issues hurt trust — counterpoint: Dirigera bridges Zigbee and Matter.
    - Matter promises portability → Could ease resale and reduce lock‑in; Home Assistant mixes protocols — counterpoint: interoperability remains uneven for complex devices.
    - Local-first demands and long support → Users want offline control and 12–15 years updates; some choose Tuya/KNX or VLAN isolation to manage cloud risks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: IKEA endorsing Matter pressures budget devices to support Thread and local control.
    - Impact: Home Assistant users gain options; non-technical buyers may get simpler setup if hubs mature.
    - Watch next: Blinds relaunch, Dirigera firmware roadmap, Matter spec updates for garages/locks and sleepy Wi‑Fi, multi‑admin reliability tests.
