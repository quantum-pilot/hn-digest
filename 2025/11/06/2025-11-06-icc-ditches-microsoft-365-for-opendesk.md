# ICC ditches Microsoft 365 for openDesk

- Score: 501 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45837342) | Link: https://www.binnenlandsbestuur.nl/digitaal/internationaal-strafhof-neemt-afscheid-van-microsoft-365

- TL;DR
  - The International Criminal Court will replace Microsoft 365 with openDesk, a European open-source workplace suite stewarded by Germany’s state-owned ZenDis under the EU’s Digital Commons EDIC. The switch follows sovereignty concerns after the ICC prosecutor briefly lost Outlook access amid US sanctions; Microsoft says ICC services weren’t halted. openDesk bundles Nextcloud, Collabora, Element, XWiki, CryptPad, and more. HN discusses enterprise licensing versus pure FOSS, notes Germany’s growing adoption, and considers potential shifts in legal-sector document standards toward open formats.

- Comment pulse
  - Digital sovereignty momentum → Germany’s openDesk, now under ZenDis, already serves 100k+ public workers; ICC switch could accelerate EU adoption.
  - Licensing reality → Production uses Enterprise editions; some parts aren’t public despite open licenses — counterpoint: GPL mandates source for recipients; akin to Red Hat.
  - Legal standards may shift → ICC move nudges law orgs toward open formats; past WordPerfect→Word transition shows industry norms can change.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A high-profile defection validates sovereign workplace stacks beyond pilots.
  - Impact: Raises pressure on hyperscalers for data residency, contractual due process, and no-unilateral-disconnect guarantees.
  - Watch next: Migration benchmarks, Collabora/Nextcloud EE openness commitments, EDIC-aligned procurement mandates, and Netherlands’ Mijn Bureau scaling.
