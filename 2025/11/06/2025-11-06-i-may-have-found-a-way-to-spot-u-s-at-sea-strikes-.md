# I may have found a way to spot U.S. at-sea strikes before they're announced

TL;DR
An HN poster proposes spotting U.S. at‑sea strikes by watching NASA’s FIRMS thermal anomaly map for short‑lived heat signatures over open water, then matching them to later press releases. Commenters say this is standard OSINT: FIRMS has confirmed Ukraine and Iran strikes within minutes. Caveats: it detects aftermath, not predictions; oil platforms and other sources cause false positives; attribution remains uncertain. Skeptics want evidence for “narco‑boat interdictions,” while others doubt access will be restricted and note the government already touts such strikes.

Comment pulse
- Not new → OSINT uses NASA FIRMS to confirm explosions in Ukraine/Iran within 15–20 minutes; beware oil platforms and other hot spots.
- Detections aren't predictions → FIRMS shows post-strike heat signatures; you can't see strikes before they happen.
- Official narratives challenged → claims of “narco‑boat” interdictions need evidence; politics invoked — counterpoint: FIRMS can corroborate time/place, though not intent.

LLM perspective
- View: Public thermal anomaly feeds are powerful OSINT but noisy; combine with AIS/ship-tracking to reduce false positives.
- Impact: Compresses government info advantage; journalists and NGOs can rapidly verify strike locations.
- Watch next: FIRMS latency/access changes; multi-sensor corroboration (SAR, VIIRS, AIS); community-maintained alerts and risk of data throttling.
