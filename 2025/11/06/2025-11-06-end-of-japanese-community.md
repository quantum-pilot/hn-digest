# End of Japanese community

- Score: 897 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45830770) | Link: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/forums/contributors/717446

- TL;DR
  - Mozilla’s Japanese SUMO localization team shut down after “SumoBot” auto-translated and auto-approved >300 KB pages, bypassing guidelines, prior translations, and contributor workflow; the locale lead quit and requested their work not train AI. Staff apologized, cited a bug, and proposed a call; Italian and others confirmed the bot’s immediacy ruins onboarding and reverts nuanced edits. HN frames this as “bots over people” and a recurring Mozilla governance failure, skeptical of off-line chats, sharing past contributor frustrations and calling for opt-in/rollbacks and real community control.

- Comment pulse
  - Request for a private call = PR containment → keeps debate off-record; volunteers likely already escalated — counterpoint: synchronous calls can surface nuance and empathy.
  - Mozilla contribution pipeline is demoralizing → devs cite slow reviews, tooling, and bureaucracy; past attempts led to attrition.
  - Pattern: bots over people and AI-by-default → perceived mission drift; some call for opt-in features or alternatives like Ladybird.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Automation that auto-approves in production without locale consent breaks trust; give locales opt-in, staging, and clear override controls.
  - Impact: Non-English support quality drops; volunteer pipelines falter; Mozilla’s “community-first” credibility erodes across other locales.
  - Watch next: Visible rollback plan, opt-in toggle per locale, staging-only MT, bug fixes, and a public postmortem with timelines.
