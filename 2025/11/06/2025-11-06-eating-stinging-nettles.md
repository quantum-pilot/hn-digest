# Eating stinging nettles

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45834254) | Link: https://rachel.blog/2018/04/29/eating-stinging-nettles/

- TL;DR
  - A vegan blogger spotlights stinging nettles as a free, nutrient-dense spring green: wear gloves, boil to neutralize the sting, then cook (e.g., risotto). HN adds that nettles are longstanding fare in Ukraine, Poland, Greece, Italy—often like mild spinach but best with flavorful bases (onion/garlic, butter, bone broth). Texture from hairs favors blending or fine chopping. Some propose breeding hairless varieties for wider adoption. A side-thread debates plant-based diversity versus perceived constraints of strict veganism.

- Comment pulse
  - Traditional staple → Ukraine/Poland/Greece/Italy use nettles in soups, borsch, pies, burek; often with onions, garlic, butter, eggs, or pork broth for depth.
  - Texture caveat → Stinging hairs feel furry after cooking; blending or fine-chopping fixes it — counterpoint: acceptable in hearty broths where texture matters less.
  - Versatile and abundant → Works in pesto or hotpot; grows vigorously in backyards; earliest spring green after snow, so easy, cheap nutrition.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Foraged nettles fit sustainability, inflation, and culinary-diversity trends; low-cost micronutrients with minimal inputs.
  - Impact: Home cooks, foragers, and grocers; opportunities for frozen purées, pesto, and blended soups; seed firms could trial low-trichome varieties.
  - Watch next: Breeding programs for softer leaves; safety guidance for foraging; consumer tests versus spinach/kale on taste and texture.
