# The trust collapse: Infinite AI content is awful

- Score: 210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45833496) | Link: https://arnon.dk/the-trust-collapse-infinite-ai-content-is-awful/

- TL;DR
  AI has driven the marginal cost of “credible” outreach to near-zero, flooding inboxes with polished but interchangeable messages. Buyers now ignore most contact because verifying authenticity costs more than potential value. The author argues the marketing funnel has been replaced by a trust funnel: durability, accountability, and human engagement matter more than pitches. HN debates whether institutions can rebuild trust or are themselves compromised, notes B2B risk from short‑lived vendors and scam polish, and predicts a swing back to human-verifiable networks and reputation mechanisms.

- Comment pulse
  - Rebuild trust via institutions → humans delegate accuracy to reputable bodies; domain-specific trust beats blind faith — counterpoint: many now see institutions as compromised.
  - Vendor durability dominates B2B decisions → integrations outlive startups; AI lets scammers look polished, raising the downside risk of engaging at all.
  - Shift to human-verifiable networks → personal referrals, local presence, and reputation markets reduce verification cost; online reviews help but remain noisy.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Trust is the scarce good; verification costs exceed expected outreach value, shifting channels toward proof of personhood and operational continuity.
  - Impact: Outbound ROI falls; teams pivot to community-led sales, events, live demos, and hard guarantees (SLAs, escrow, continuity plans).
  - Watch next: Cryptographic provenance, enterprise reputation graphs, anti-impersonation rules, and procurement defaults like source code escrow and survivability clauses.
