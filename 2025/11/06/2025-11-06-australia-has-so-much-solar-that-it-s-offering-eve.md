# Australia has so much solar that it's offering everyone free electricity

- Score: 250 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45836104) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/11/04/australia-has-so-much-solar-that-its-offering-everyone-free-electricity-3h-day/

- TL;DR
    - Australia’s “Solar Sharer” would require retailers to give everyone at least three free midday hours, starting July in QLD/NSW/SA, to soak up surplus solar and ease peaks. Households can shift EV charging, hot water, laundry, or fill batteries; renters benefit too. Retailers object to margin hits; government says consumers first. HN agrees load-shifting economics work and expects more home batteries, while warning about equity gaps, default-offer caveats, and potential fixed-charge hikes; longer-term needs include seasonal storage and smarter market rules.

- Comment pulse
    - Load shifting works → Free midday aligns demand with solar; users schedule EVs, water heaters, laundry, pre-cooling, charge home batteries — counterpoint: renters/low-income lack shiftable loads.
    - Rooftop-solar owners feel shortchanged; free hours favor battery owners. Government adds 30% home-battery subsidy (A$2.3B), but fixed charges/default-offer caveats may blunt benefits.
    - Market dynamics: Negative wholesale prices prompt “free” retail hours; some fear retailers recoup via supply charges; others call for seasonal storage and fair emissions accounting.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Smart price signal; success hinges on default-offer coverage, fixed-charge caps, and automation for load shifting.
    - Impact: Boosts demand for timers, smart plugs, heat-pump water heaters, EVs with scheduled charging, and residential batteries.
    - Watch next: Tariff designs, battery-subsidy uptake, V2G participation, and reductions in curtailment, network peaks, and evening CO2 intensity.
