# FBI tries to unmask owner of archive.is

- Score: 634 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45836826) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/Archive-today-FBI-Demands-Data-from-Provider-Tucows-11066346.html

- TL;DR
  Archive.today (archive.is/ph) signaled trouble via a “canary” linking to a court order directing Canadian registrar Tucows to disclose its customer’s identity, addresses, connection, and payment data to the FBI. Authenticity isn’t confirmed. The target and theory of harm are unclear: copyright evasion and botnet-style scraping are plausible; investigations disagree whether operators sit in Russia or New York. HN debates preservation vs copyright, U.S. jurisdiction and priorities, and double standards amid AI-era scraping.

- Comment pulse
  - Knowledge preservation first → archiving bypasses paywalls to keep records; copyright terms are overlong — counterpoint: ignoring robots/paywalls and short-link design undermines consent and durability.
  - FBI overreach/politics → extraterritorial case should be civil, not criminal; enforcement priorities feel political and inconsistent.
  - Scraping double standard → US tolerates mega-cap AI training on web data; smaller actors get targeted; irony: White House itself linked to archive.ph.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Unmasking via registrar records is straightforward; if real, anonymity likely ends.
  - Impact: Expect service instability, domain churn, and chilling effects on paywall-bypass archiving.
  - Watch next: Tucows’ compliance stance, authenticity verification, and any follow-on orders to hosts, CDNs, or payment processors.
