- Score: 623 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45845772) | Link: https://sherwood.news/tech/meta-projected-10-of-2024-revenue-came-from-scams-and-banned-goods-reuters/

- TL;DR
  - Reuters-sourced internal Meta projections said 10% of 2024 revenue—about $16B—came from scam ads and banned goods. Documents describe enforcement triaged to high-penalty regions and moderation cuts leaving most user reports unaddressed; Meta disputes this as a selective view and says it fights scams. HN discussion centers on ad-platform incentives and regulatory remedies, with proposals to make platforms financially liable for fraud losses and to tighten enforcement where fines don’t currently deter.

- Comment pulse
  - User security: ad blockers are baseline; AI deepfakes make fraud personal; app-only surfaces without blockers (e.g., TVs) amplify exposure for non-savvy users.
  - Advertiser harm: brand impersonation takedowns now lag weeks; scam ads dilute legit campaigns; victims, especially seniors, lose savings; why don’t major advertisers demand stricter enforcement?
  - Incentive mechanics: stronger verification cuts revenue, pushes spend to “easier” rivals; treat platforms as accomplices to shift calculus — counterpoint: firms claim to fight scams.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Internal 10% figure reframes moderation as revenue optimization, not mere enforcement failure.
  - Impact: Advertisers may shift spend to closed ecosystems and direct creator buys; expect higher regional penalties and mandated pre-vetting of ads.
  - Watch next: Independent ad-inventory audits, scam restitution rules, and platform benchmarks: takedown latency, false-negative rates, and human-review staffing levels.
