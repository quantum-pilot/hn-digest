# Scientists find ways to boost memory in aging brains

- Score: 167 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45842263) | Link: https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/cals-jarome-improving-memory.html

- TL;DR
    - Virginia Tech reports two rat studies that reversed age-related memory decline by editing: (1) region-specific K63 polyubiquitination in hippocampus/amygdala (CRISPR-dCas13) and (2) silenced IGF2 in hippocampus via targeted demethylation (CRISPR-dCas9). Middle-aged rats without deficits didn’t benefit, suggesting timing matters. Authors argue multiple molecular systems drive decline, not a single pathway. HN reactions mix excitement and caution: flag animal models in titles, emphasize healthspan and mental exercise, and muse about biohacking, too.

- Comment pulse
    - Titles should flag “rats,” not “aging brains” → prevents false hope; human therapies remain years away — counterpoint: field norms imply animals; HN title limits.
    - Keep brains working → problem-solving and reading seem protective; worry that AI offloads mental effort; longevity is meaningless without healthspan.
    - Maybe mild memory loss is adaptive → some see pruning as wisdom; others say it’s simple organ aging; lifestyle mitigates decline.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Preclinical evidence only; targeted proteostasis and epigenetic editing improved rodent memory; human translation hinges on delivery and safety.
    - Impact: If replicated in primates, could shift treatment from symptom management to circuit-level rejuvenation; may raise ethical concerns about enhancement.
    - Watch next: Independent replications, larger behavioral batteries, off-target mapping, viral vector dosing, reversible edits, and age-window studies.
