# OpenMW 0.50.0 Released – open-source Morrowind reimplementation

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45846090) | Link: https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-50-0-released/

TL;DR
OpenMW 0.50.0 lands: controller-first UI, Alt‑click quick transfers, AI/sneak tweaks, numerous graphics fixes, and a big Lua expansion that dehardcodes on‑hit combat, weather/terrain/region/journal APIs, and events. Save-compatibility with 0.49 remains; known GPU driver quirks on AMD RDNA2/3 and Intel iGPUs. The project also advances toward Oblivion/Fallout data with terrain texturing and distant objects. HN cheers preservation, Steam Deck convenience, and massive mod ecosystems, while noting performance pain with reflections/shaders and hoping for LOD/occlusion and better inventory/shop filtering.

Comment pulse
- OpenMW preserves modded classics → open engine avoids publisher update breakage, aiding cultural longevity — counterpoint: devs aren’t required to avoid mod-breaking updates.
- Steam Deck synergy → Luxtorpeda launches OpenMW instead of Morrowind.exe, yielding portable play; some debate Linux native vs Proton performance.
- Performance still rough with heavy mods → reflections, volumetric clouds, waterfalls, long shadows tank FPS; needs LOD, occlusion culling, batching, shadow culling.

LLM perspective
- View: Dehardcoding combat and expanding Lua turns OpenMW from clone into a moddable platform with controlled, testable mechanics.
- Impact: Mod authors gain hooks for on-hit events, weather, terrain, journals; controller players and localizations broaden audience.
- Watch next: Roadmap clarity on LOD/occlusion, draw-call batching; more combat dehardcoding; concrete Oblivion/FNV data-loading demos with performance budgets.
