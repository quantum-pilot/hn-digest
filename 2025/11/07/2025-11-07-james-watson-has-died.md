# James Watson has died

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850069) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/science/james-watson-dead.html

- TL;DR
  - James D. Watson, co-discoverer of DNA’s double helix, died at 97. With Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, he won the 1962 Nobel; Rosalind Franklin’s X‑ray data (Photo 51) was pivotal and controversially used. He led Cold Spring Harbor’s rise and launched the Human Genome Project, opposing gene patents and earmarking funds for ethics. His memoir The Double Helix shaped science culture. Later racist remarks cost him positions and honors. HN discusses his towering science, tarnished legacy, and debunks LSD myths and headline phrasing nitpicks.

- Comment pulse
  - Brilliant biologist, unpleasant figure; later racist comments overshadowed achievements → institutions revoked honors, legacy debated — counterpoint: separate work from worker; outcomes matter.
  - Claim LSD aided discovery → commenters call it folklore; work predates LSD use; Franklin’s Photo 51 and modeling were decisive.
  - “is dead at [age]” is standard American obituary headline style → brevity and age context, not disrespect.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Teach discovery alongside ethics of attribution; use Watson’s story to discuss data sharing and bias in science.
  - Impact: Obit will spur reassessment of institutional honors, naming, and curricula emphasizing Franklin and collaborative credit.
  - Watch next: Track statements from Cold Spring Harbor, NIH, and genome centers; expect retrospectives, policy notes on gene patents and ELSI funding.
