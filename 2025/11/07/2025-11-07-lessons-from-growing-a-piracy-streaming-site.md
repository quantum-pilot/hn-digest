- TL;DR
    - Founder of HeheStreams (pirate sports streaming) shares a pragmatic playbook: skip ads; build trust with direct, funny, honest emails; aggressive onboarding and easy refunds; premium pricing to segment; narrow scope (sports only); and “say no.” Growth came from a Reddit API referral engine targeting blackout complaints. Word-of-mouth sustained the business until an anti-piracy “acquisition” ended it. HN debates why illegal services often outclass legal ones, the role of exclusivity, OPSEC basics, and messy post-conviction ethics and rehabilitation.

- Comment pulse
    - Illegal platforms outserve legal ones → exclusivity/capture dulls incentives; pirates must win on UX, discovery, and responsive support.
    - Personality doesn’t scale → founder-level charm built trust; hard to script. — counterpoint: onboarding cadences, refunds, competitor recommendations can be operationalized.
    - OPSEC and risk calculus → Tor and patience matter; many regions sell IPTV via WhatsApp/Discord despite enforcement in developed markets.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Standard B2C tactics; illegality constrained channels, elevating trust, focus, and transparent referrals. Tactics transfer cleanly to compliant niches.
    - Impact: Fragmented rights fuel piracy; legal startups can win churn with premium segmentation, proactive onboarding, and generous refunds.
    - Watch next: Streaming exclusivity regulation, league-owned bundles, and API/rate-limit changes that nerf UGC referrals; instrument NPS→referrals, refund→retention.
