# AI is Dunning-Kruger as a service

- Score: 188 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45851483) | Link: https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/30/ai-is-dunning-kruger-as-a-service/

- TL;DR
  - Christian Heilmann argues modern tech culture—speed, vanity metrics, “fake it till you make it”—pairs perfectly with LLMs that produce confident, sycophantic answers, nudging users toward vibe‑driven creation and away from craft. He urges embracing imperfect, human making instead of outsourcing creativity to machines optimized for engagement. HN counters are split: some report huge productivity gains when giving AIs precise instructions; others say AI turbocharges Brandolini’s Law, forcing experts to debunk nonsense and rewarding flashy output that misleads managers.

- Comment pulse
  - AI excels at doing, not deciding → with precise instructions, devs rapidly build tools, freeing focus — counterpoint: negative externalities may negate benefits.
  - AI amplifies Brandolini’s Law → teams waste cycles debunking confident-but-wrong proposals funneled to management.
  - AI enables performative output that fools managers → volume and gloss create “fake superhumans,” skewing promotions and priorities.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The problem is incentives that reward confident output over verified truth; align UX and metrics to correctness, not engagement.
  - Impact: Teams adopting AI without verification pipelines risk quality regressions, security toil, and eroded craft.
  - Watch next: Benchmarks on hallucination rates, default citations, integrated unit/property tests, and tooling that tracks compute and environmental externalities.
