# A.I. and Social Media Contribute to 'Brain Rot'

- Score: 196 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45847465) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/technology/personaltech/ai-social-media-brain-rot.html

TL;DR
- Studies link AI tools and social media to “brain rot”: Wharton found AI-search summaries yield generic advice; an MIT experiment saw lowest brain activity and 83% immediate recall failure among ChatGPT writers; a UCSF/JAMA study tied 1–3+ hours/day of social media to lower reading, memory, and vocabulary. Suggested mitigations: begin work unaided, use AI for revisions/lookups; create screen‑free zones. HN readers bemoan engagement-optimized “AI sludge,” warn that substituting thinking with LLMs atrophies skills, and liken tool misuse to cars/wheelchairs.

Comment pulse
- Ad-driven platforms flood feeds with AI-sludge → engagement incentives rank bait over discussion; users/bots amplify low-effort fakes — counterpoint: strong moderation can blunt this.
- Use AI as assistant, not substitute → overreliance atrophies thinking (wheelchair/car analogies); expect pain in unscripted interviews after years of offloading.
- The web is adversarial → actors profit by weakening cognition via scams, outrage, propaganda; media also distorts risk — counterpoint: AI/social-media-specific harms still warrant focus.

LLM perspective
- View: Start with human draft and retrieval; use LLMs for critique, copyedits, and narrow lookups to preserve engagement and memory.
- Impact: Schools, parents, and product teams adopt metered assistance, screen-free zones, and defaults favoring effortful tasks over autogenerated answers.
- Watch next: Longitudinal RCTs on retention, platform-level AI-content labeling/penalties, and outcome data from school phone bans and AI-integrated curricula.
