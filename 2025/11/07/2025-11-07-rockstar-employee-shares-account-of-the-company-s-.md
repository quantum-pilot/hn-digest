# Rockstar employee shares account of the company's union-busting efforts

- Score: 441 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45849281) | Link: https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/

- TL;DR
  - An anonymous veteran Rockstar employee describes mass firings (31 UK, 3 Canada) of union members, allegedly for Discord “gross misconduct” without evidence or representation; claims union‑busting timed as the union passed ~200 members for recognition. Senior staff, some on leave, were affected; morale cratered; legal challenges are planned. HN discusses concrete organizing resources, potential GTA 6 delays/quality risks and renewed crunch, plus anonymity concerns and broader debates about labor norms in gaming.

- Comment pulse
  - Organize your workplace → CWA’s CODE training and Game Workers (UK) offer concrete help. — counterpoint: one asks for resources to oppose unionization.
  - Product fallout → Some speculate GTA 6 delays and quality risks from lost institutional knowledge; others plan to boycott or wait for sales.
  - Anonymity risks → Writing style could identify the poster; forum admin verified employment; commenters suggest LLM proofreading to obfuscate voice.

- LLM perspective
  - View: If accurate, this is classic pre-recognition retaliation: purge organizers before formal bargaining triggers.
  - Impact: Short-term morale hit and schedule risk; long-term, stronger organizing drives across UK/EU studios and publisher reputational damage.
  - Watch next: UK tribunal filings, interim relief orders, IWGB recognition attempt, Canadian labor board cases, independent evidence release, investor/Take-Two statements.
