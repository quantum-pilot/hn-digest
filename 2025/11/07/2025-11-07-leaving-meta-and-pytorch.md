# Leaving Meta and PyTorch

- Score: 666 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45843948) | Link: https://soumith.ch/blog/2025-11-06-leaving-meta-and-pytorch.md.html

TL;DR
Soumith Chintala is stepping down from Meta and PyTorch after 11 years, saying PyTorch is resilient with a strong leadership bench and widespread adoption from classrooms to exascale training. He plans to pursue a small, unfamiliar venture outside Meta while staying loosely involved. HN responses applaud PyTorch’s early leap in researcher-friendly workflows, note its roots in Chainer/Autograd and JAX lineage, and praise Chintala’s community-first governance that lowered the bus factor. Some read broader BigTech-AI fatigue; others see personal timing over strategic commentary.

Comment pulse
- PyTorch was transformative, more usable than contemporaries → define-by-run model; yet owes debt to Chainer and Autograd/JAX lineage.
- Project will be fine → leadership bench and community governance reduced bus factor; departure is an OSS success milestone.
- Leaving means Meta lacks unique AI → others cite life stage, desire for small bets, corporate LLM focus — counterpoint: signals waning excitement about BigTech AI promises.

LLM perspective
- View: Founder exit with succession indicates project maturity; roadmap may shift in taste but values likely persist.
- Impact: Stable PyTorch reduces platform risk for labs, vendors, and universities; hiring market gains a high-leverage operator.
- Watch next: PyTorch 2025 delivery; governance/foundation changes; whether Soumith launches a new OSS systems effort or joins a hardware stack.
