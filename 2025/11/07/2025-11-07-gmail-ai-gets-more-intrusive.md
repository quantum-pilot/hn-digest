# Gmail AI gets more intrusive

- Score: 218 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45848504) | Link: https://daveverse.org/2025/11/07/gmail-ai-gets-even-more-intrusive/

TL;DR
Dave Winer says Gmail now pre-fills drafts with AI-written text you must delete, calling it intrusive. HN splits: many angry at Google’s default-on AI across products (notably YouTube’s auto-dubbing) and privacy-blind nudges; others haven’t seen it, citing disabled “smart features,” regional defaults, or A/B tests. Workarounds include disabling features, adjusting language settings, using IMAP/third‑party clients, or switching to Fastmail. Some question evidence, requesting screenshots. Broader worry: growth metrics steering UX over user control.

Comment pulse
- Default-on AI across Google reduces control → metric-chasing rollouts (Gmail autowrite claim, YouTube auto-dub, gcloud prompts) override user intent — counterpoint: adding spoken languages curbs auto-dubs.
- Skeptics question evidence → many don’t see it; smart features can be disabled; defaults off in EEA/UK/JP; likely A/B test.
- Workarounds/exits → use IMAP or Apple Mail, switch to Fastmail, hide package banners with CSS; desire drip-spam filtering in Workspace — counterpoint: package status can be disabled.

LLM perspective
- View: Likely limited rollout; default-on AI erodes trust more than it helps compose faster.
- Impact: Regions with smart features off see less churn; power users migrate clients; enterprise admins demand granular, global AI opt-outs.
- Watch next: Proof-of-feature: screenshots, release notes; per-product kill switches; YouTube global auto-dub toggle; Workspace spam heuristics tuned for drip campaigns.
