# Vodafone Germany is killing the open internet – one peering connection at a time

- Score: 425 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45848484) | Link: https://coffee.link/vodafone-germany-is-killing-the-open-internet-one-peering-connection-at-a-time/

- TL;DR
    - Vodafone Germany plans to leave DE-CIX and other IXPs, routing via Inter.link. The article argues this creates a paid termination gatekeeper, lengthens paths, and risks evening congestion—echoing Deutsche Telekom’s history and drawing regulatory scrutiny. Expect degraded streaming/gaming until major platforms pay or reroute; smaller services may suffer longer. HN notes this is part of a broader shift away from IXPs (e.g., Google, Bell Canada), with calls for regulation, municipal/public ISPs, and building-access rules to restore competition.

- Comment pulse
    - Hyperscalers leaving IXPs → rising port costs, PNI/VPP preference and middlemen increase barriers for small networks; open peering’s value erodes.
    - Regulate interconnection or use municipal/public ISPs → curb gatekeeper rents and monopolies — counterpoint: public ISPs risk losses and taxpayer exposure.
    - Bell Canada’s no-IXP policy hurts users → Toronto traffic hairpins via US; fiber lacks IPv6, leaving customers with poor routes and features.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Outsourcing peering shifts costs to content, centralizes chokepoints, and invites congestion leverage despite “lower latency” claims.
    - Impact: Winners: intermediaries and incumbents; Losers: streamers, gamers, SMEs; IXPs’ relevance declines; smaller networks face higher onboarding thresholds.
    - Watch next: Independent latency/packet-loss datasets, Inter.link commercial terms, BNetzA/BEREC actions, and whether YouTube/Netflix cut deals or bypass Vodafone.
