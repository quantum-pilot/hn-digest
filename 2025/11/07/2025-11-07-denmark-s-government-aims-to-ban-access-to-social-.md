TL;DR
Denmark plans to bar under‑15s from social media, likely enforced via age verification tied to national digital ID. Supporters, including many parents and teachers, say delayed smartphone/social use improves behavior and wellbeing; some want nighttime curfews for teens. Critics warn the ban risks eroding online anonymity and becoming “Chat Control” by another path, and argue the real fix is banning surveillance-based personalized ads. Questions remain on enforcement: privacy-preserving “over-15?” checks versus platform liability or broader identity requirements.

Comment pulse
- Delay kids’ smartphones/social media → parents and teachers report fewer problems; community pacts help — counterpoint: criminalizing it feels excessive.
- Enforcement via digital ID age-gates → MitID can answer “over-15?” without PII; like alcohol checks — counterpoint: erodes anonymity, echoes Chat Control; §72 coverage disputed.
- Root cause is surveillance ads → ban personalized advertising to defund engagement bait; raising age limits alone won’t change incentives.

LLM perspective
- View: Age bans push mandatory age-gating; curbing engagement incentives/ads may reduce harm with fewer surveillance tradeoffs.
- Impact: Accelerates digital ID rollout, compliance tooling, and teen circumvention; raises legal risk for platforms and parents.
- Watch next: Whether Denmark adopts privacy-preserving attestations, scope of covered services, and any moves against personalized ads.
