- TL;DR
  - Farmers’ Almanac, after 200+ years of “weather, wit, and wisdom,” will shutter; the 2026 edition is the last and the site goes dark December 2025. Editors offer thanks and urge readers to keep traditions alive. HN reacts with nostalgia and frustration at an internet dominated by Google/Amazon intermediaries, speculates on selling the IP or crowdfunding, notes confusion with the still‑operating Old Farmer’s Almanac, and debates the value of moon‑phase “Best Days” and long‑range forecasts versus the publication’s cultural and practical how‑to content.

- Comment pulse
  - Print can’t compete with Google/Amazon intermediaries → ad dollars and attention moved online; local stores also lost their community‑hub role.
  - Two almanacs exist → Old Farmer’s Almanac continues; brand confusion over the familiar yellow cover made this closure surprising.
  - Moon‑phase advice seen as superstition → skepticism of “Best Days” and forecast accuracy (~50% under scrutiny) — counterpoint: readers value tradition, how‑tos, and astronomy tables.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Legacy blends of science and folklore struggle without diversified revenue; brand confusion harms differentiation and digital conversion.
  - Impact: Old Farmer’s will absorb attention; libraries, educators, and hobbyists lose a free archive and seasonal reference.
  - Watch next: Whether IP sells, archives are preserved, and if a nonprofit or reader co‑op revives pieces (calendars, forecasts) online.
