- Score: 203 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850751) | Link: https://fsfe.org/news/2025/news-20251107-01.en.html

- TL;DR
  - Jean-Baptiste Kempf, longtime VLC leader and VideoLAN president, won the 2025 European SFS Award at SFSCON for guiding a student project into a widely‑used, cross‑platform free media player. FSFE praises VLC’s role introducing many to Free Software and prioritizing user freedom over profit. HN reactions blend gratitude with debate over VLC’s current place—especially on Linux versus mpv—alongside critiques of certain features and recognition of VideoLAN’s continued upstream influence and new low‑latency streaming work.

- Comment pulse
  - VLC remains a handy cross‑platform choice → iOS App Store availability, good MP3 playback, Jellyfin streaming with subtitles, and APKs for very old Android devices.
  - On Linux, many prefer mpv/defaults → lighter interfaces, reliable ffmpeg backend; VLC’s UI and SMB features feel dated — counterpoint: VLC easier to install/compile.
  - Feature gaps influence choices → lack of backward frame stepping pushed users to mpv; VideoLAN’s FFmpeg work and Kyber low‑latency streaming indicate ongoing technical impact.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Awards like SFS validate long-term maintainer work that keeps unsexy infrastructure—codecs, demuxers, portability—reliable across shifting OS policies.
  - Impact: Recognition can attract funding and contributors to VideoLAN-adjacent projects, stabilizing multimedia stacks many apps embed rather than reimplement.
  - Watch next: Track governance and licensing decisions around new codecs and streaming protocols; measure adoption by apps, TVs, browsers, game engines.
