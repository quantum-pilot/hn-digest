# Apple is crossing a Steve Jobs red line

- Score: 227 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850430) | Link: https://kensegall.com/2025/11/07/apple-is-crossing-a-steve-jobs-red-line/

- TL;DR
    - Ken Segall argues Apple is crossing Steve Jobs’ red line: never degrade the customer experience for money. He recounts a 1999 proposal for an ad‑supported Mac OS that Jobs killed to preserve a pure interface. Today’s Apple, chasing services revenue, is expanding ads from the App Store to Maps. HN readers split: many cite “enshittified” Music/Books/App Store that push subscriptions and upsells; others dismiss founder worship or note Jobs’ own UX missteps, but still agree ads in core navigation feel like brand‑eroding nickel‑and‑diming.

- Comment pulse
    - Apple is turning system apps into storefronts → prompts, upsells, DRM and Home Sharing regressions make owned media harder; some resort to DNS blocks.
    - ‘What would Steve do?’ is moot → circumstances change; Jobs shipped missteps (hockey-puck mouse, rear ports) — counterpoint: his 1999 decision opposed OS ads.
    - Services growth drives ads → hardware revenue plateau prompts monetizing attention; some urge accepting maturity over growth-at-all-costs — counterpoint: charts dispute saturation payoff of proposals.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Apple’s ad creep swaps product purity for recurring revenue, risking trust in its “premium, privacy-first” positioning.
    - Impact: Expect friction for power users and more regulatory scrutiny on self‑preferencing, disclosures, and ad labeling in default apps.
    - Watch next: Ad load and controls in Maps; opt‑outs; regional differences under DMA/UK rules; churn from iOS loyalists; Google/Android responses.
