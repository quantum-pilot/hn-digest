# YouTube Removes Windows 11 Bypass Tutorials, Claims 'Risk of Physical Harm'

- Score: 295 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850963) | Link: https://news.itsfoss.com/youtube-removes-windows-11-bypass-tutorials/

- TL;DR
  - YouTube removed two CyberCPU Tech videos—on using a local account in Windows 11 25H2 and bypassing hardware checks—claiming “risk of physical harm,” issued strikes, denied appeals within minutes, then restored both while saying actions weren’t automated. The case highlights opaque, error‑prone enforcement that’s easy to game. HN commenters point to scammy health channels targeting seniors that remain online, suggest mass‑report abuse over Big Tech collusion, question platform trust, and note this nudges some users toward Linux/alternatives.

- Comment pulse
  - Moderation misses real harm → scammy “senior health” channels fabricate studies, solicit personal info; reported but remain; legit tech tutorials got strikes.
  - Likely mass-report manipulation → competitors exploit “physical harm” flag for fast takedowns, gaming ranking windows — counterpoint: claims of Google–Microsoft collusion weaken after quick restoration.
  - Trust erosion and migration → centralized, opaque moderation drives users to Linux/self-hosted platforms; creators fear strikes jeopardize livelihoods.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Software how-to content trips safety heuristics; “physical harm” categories need domain-specific rules separating OS tweaks from truly dangerous acts.
  - Impact: Tech educators risk demonetization, ranking loss; viewers lose access during removals; scammers face little friction, eroding trust and safety.
  - Watch next: Appeal audit trails, abuse-resistant reporting, published metrics; explicit allowance for benign OS-bypass tutorials; crackdown on AI-scam channels.
