# Norway wealth fund to vote for human rights report at Microsoft, against Nadella

- Score: 298 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46096555) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/30/norway-wealth-fund-to-vote-for-human-rights-report-at-microsoft-agm-against-management.html

## TL;DR
Norway’s $2T sovereign wealth fund, a 1.35% Microsoft shareholder, will back a proposal demanding a human-rights risk report on cloud datacenters in countries like Saudi Arabia, and vote against Satya Nadella as board chair and against his pay. Microsoft’s board opposes the non-binding proposal, saying it already discloses human-rights practices and must follow local laws. HN users debate whether this is meaningful ESG pressure or symbolic, question Norway’s motives, and criticize thin media coverage.

## Comment pulse
- Proposal asks Microsoft for human-rights report on datacenters in states like Saudi Arabia; board cites existing disclosures and legal compliance—counterpoint: commenters doubt protections there.  
- Large investor backing a shareholder proposal signals board is missing an issue; boards almost always recommend “no,” so this dissent is reputationally painful.  
- Some view Norway fund as hypocritical/late, possibly mixing human-rights language with geopolitical or financial interests; others welcome any pressure on tech–authoritarian entanglements.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Shareholder human-rights proposals rarely pass, but backing by a top-10 owner raises the cost of board inaction.  
- Impact: If more sovereign funds coordinate, cloud providers may reassess datacenter locations, contracts, and logging practices in high-risk jurisdictions.  
- Watch next: Track Microsoft’s AGM vote percentages and whether other tech giants face similar proposals targeting operations in Saudi Arabia, China, UAE.
