# ETH-Zurich: Digital Design and Computer Architecture; 227-0003-10L, Spring, 2025

- Score: 110 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46098747) | Link: https://safari.ethz.ch/ddca/spring2025/doku.php?id=start

### TL;DR
- ETH Zurich’s Spring 2025 Digital Design and Computer Architecture course is a mandatory first‑year CS class teaching digital circuits up through a simple microprocessor, emphasizing fundamentals, trade‑offs, and systematic debugging. Students build a MIPS CPU in lab sessions; lectures run twice weekly with multiple lab slots and no prerequisites. Materials, livestreams, and past videos are publicly available under a CC BY‑NC‑SA license. HN discussion highlights the course’s quality, ETH’s open‑hardware efforts, and its broader systems legacy.

### Comment pulse
- Mandatory ETH CS course is widely loved → clear bottom‑up architecture teaching plus labs building a MIPS CPU make hardware concepts tangible and memorable.  
- Open‑source ASIC design is emerging → ETH‑linked projects show promise, — counterpoint: skeptics doubt viability for complex chips without expensive proprietary tools.  
- Comments celebrate ETH’s broader legacy → Niklaus Wirth’s Oberon FPGA processor, accessible books, and projects like RumbleDB and JSONiq showcase a strong systems‑and‑languages culture.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Public, hands‑on architecture courses with labs demystify hardware and make digital design accessible to software‑only students and self‑learners.  
- Impact: Sharing these materials and open ASIC flows could grow the hardware‑literate workforce beyond students in well‑funded engineering schools.  
- Watch next: Quality of freely available EDA stacks, reproducible course lab setups, and maintenance of video/wiki resources as curricula evolve.
