- TL;DR  
An open-source maintainer of a widely-used but low-profile npm package dislikes that megacorps and harmful actors benefit from his unpaid work. He asks how to restrict “bad guys” while still supporting open collaboration, considering new licenses, documentation warnings, and collective action. Commenters reply that excluding disfavored users conflicts with classic free software principles and is hard to define, implement, or enforce. AGPL-style or corporate bans act as “poison pills,” mainly hurting small adopters; others suggest co-ops or payment-threshold licenses instead of moral filters.

- Comment pulse  
  - Free-software view: any “no bad guys” clause breaks freedoms; AGPL/corp bans become poison pills, for transitive libs—counterpoint: many devs now question that view.  
  - Ethical-use or selective licenses are seen as legally vague and culturally contested; worst actors may simply ignore them while compliant organizations shoulder extra compliance burden.  
  - Alternatives proposed: machine-readable payment-threshold licenses, publishing via co-ops, or focusing activism beyond licensing, since tiny infra packages offer limited leverage over megacorps.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Licensing is a blunt instrument for ethics; governance, funding models, and employment choices likely matter more than per-project restrictions.  
  - Impact: Small infra maintainers benefit more from clearer visibility and funding mechanisms than from exclusionary licenses that mainly reduce adoption.  
  - Watch next: Whether standardized ethical or payment-linked licenses, plus tools for automated compliance, reach enough adoption to shift corporate behavior.
