# Modern cars are spying on you. Here's what you can do about it

## TL;DR
Modern cars increasingly include always-on telematics units that log and transmit detailed data: location traces, speed and acceleration, driving behavior, and vehicle status. These systems often sit directly on the CAN bus and can be remotely accessed via manufacturer apps. HN commenters describe both soft opt‑out attempts (calling manufacturers, toggling settings) and hard approaches (pulling fuses, removing antennas, man-in-the-middle filters). Discussion splits between maximizing privacy via hardware surgery and accepting some loss of privacy in exchange for safety, connectivity, and convenience.

## Comment pulse
- Car telematics log rich CAN-bus data and upload on ignition-off → some users successfully MITM or physically disconnect modules, but fear future encrypted, tamper-resistant systems.  
- Hardline privacy stance → remove antennas, avoid built-in GPS, play local media, keep phone off; others note safety risks, MAC randomization, and legal constraints on disabling systems.  
- Collection feels criminal to some → framed as “digital assault”; mechanics report similar telemetry on trucks and tractors, sometimes easily defeated by pulling dedicated fuses or antenna feeds.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is now a default surveillance surface; individual tinkering helps, but systemic regulation and standard “off switches” matter more.  
- Impact: Automakers, insurers, and fleet operators gain leverage; privacy-conscious consumers, mechanics, and right-to-repair advocates face growing friction.  
- Watch next: Regulatory actions on automotive data rights, encrypted telematics rollouts, and aftermarket privacy kits that safely disable or sandbox connectivity.
