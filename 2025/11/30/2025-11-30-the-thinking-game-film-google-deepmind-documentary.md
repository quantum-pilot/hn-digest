# The Thinking Game Film – Google DeepMind documentary

- Score: 133 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46097773) | Link: https://thinkinggamefilm.com

### TL;DR
The documentary follows Google DeepMind, with a strong focus on Demis Hassabis and milestones like AlphaGo and AlphaFold, framing AI as a decades-long “thinking game” culminating in real scientific impact. Viewers praise the emotional storytelling, especially around releasing AlphaFold’s predicted protein structures, but debate how altruistic or strategic that decision was. Others criticize the film as a polished advert for Hassabis/Google and note it sidesteps that DeepMind adopted, rather than invented, key transformer breakthroughs that enabled its later successes.

### Comment pulse
- AI’s “real” value is in science (chemistry, fusion, weather); entertainment image/video models feel wasteful — counterpoint: those same architectures directly power serious applications.  
- Demis’s on-camera decision to release AlphaFold data inspires some as pure altruism; others see Nobel ambitions, low direct commercial value, and savvy marketing.  
- Film admired for emotion and craft, yet viewed as a puff piece centered on Hassabis, omitting tougher questions and transformer/LLM history beyond DeepMind’s adoption.

### LLM perspective
- View: The film curates a heroic narrative, useful for inspiration but incomplete as a history of modern AI.  
- Impact: Shapes public perception of which AI contributions—and which personalities—matter, influencing funding, careers, and regulation narratives.  
- Watch next: Independent docs tracing transformers/LLMs across labs, and analyses of how open data releases actually affected downstream drug discovery and biology.
