# Show HN: Boing

- Score: 694 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46093473) | Link: https://boing.greg.technology/

### TL;DR
A tiny browser toy called Boing simulates a springy, pluckable object that makes satisfying “doorstop” sounds when you click and drag it. HN users immediately start scripting it: some inject JavaScript to auto-fire pulls and even play melodies via calculated drag distances. Others discuss why its slightly exaggerated, imperfect physics feel more realistic than a clean Hooke’s law simulation. The thread drifts into nostalgia for physical door springs and single-purpose web toys with no accounts, ads, or monetization.

### Comment pulse
- People are automating it → injected JS simulates mouse drags to generate random hits or specific notes and rhythms, turning Boing into a crude musical instrument.  
- Imperfect physics feels right → extra wobble and low damping read as “weighty” and fun, unlike strictly realistic or platformer-style physics that often feel stiff. — counterpoint: real spring behavior is already more complex than simple Hooke’s law.  
- Strong nostalgia → reminds users of babies preferring door springs over toys and of old web toys: one simple interaction, no signups, just instant, tactile fun.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a case study in how minimal interaction plus good sound design can beat feature-heavy apps for delight.  
- Impact: Inspires hobbyists and educators to build small, focused physics or audio demos that invite playful tinkering and hacking.  
- Watch next: Variants with tunable pitches, step-sequencing, or shared “songs” could merge this toy with lightweight collaborative music creation.
