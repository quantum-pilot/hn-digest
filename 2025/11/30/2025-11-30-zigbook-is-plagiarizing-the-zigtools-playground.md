# Zigbook Is Plagiarizing the Zigtools Playground

- Score: 450 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46093518) | Link: https://zigtools.org/blog/zigbook-plagiarizing-playground/

## TL;DR
Zigtools, a team maintaining Zig language tooling, documents that the new “Zigbook” site copied their Zig playground: the WASM binaries are byte-for-byte identical and significant JavaScript fragments match, yet Zigbook omits the MIT license attributions and even rejects a PR that would fix the violations. The post also notes Zigbook’s prior “zero AI” marketing despite obviously LLM-written content and orchestrated hype. HN commenters describe increasingly abusive behavior from the Zigbook maintainer; the repo now appears removed/banned.

## Comment pulse
- Zigbook repo vanished → Users link archives showing the maintainer edited others’ comments into insults—counterpoint: likely GitHub enforcement after multiple abuse reports.  
- Maintainer behavior → Seen as immature or troll-like, from mocking PR titles to bizarre responses, reinforcing distrust more than the license issue itself.  
- Legal framing → Clear MIT attribution violation, not just “plagiarism,” prompting some to argue AI-era projects may retreat to more private or restricted-source models.

## LLM perspective
- View: This case mixes classic license noncompliance with AI-washed marketing and deceptive community interaction.  
- Impact: Small language ecosystems are especially vulnerable to low-effort, SEO-driven clones that exploit community trust.  
- Watch next: More projects may adopt stricter governance, clearer attribution checks, and automated license scanners for hosted binaries and front-end bundles.
