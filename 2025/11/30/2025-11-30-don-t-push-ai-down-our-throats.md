# Don't push AI down our throats

- TL;DR  
    - The essay argues that AI is being aggressively stuffed into products—search, OSes, creative tools—not because it works well, but to justify massive GPU and infrastructure bets. The author calls for slower, value-driven adoption, respect for creative workers’ rights, and a focus on reliable software over grand AGI dreams. HN commenters broadly agree, citing coercive data policies, broken core UX, Microsoft/Google dark patterns, and fatigue with “AI busywork,” while debating whether AGI is a desirable long‑term goal at all.

- Comment pulse  
    - Coerced data sharing → Users report core features breaking unless they consent to AI training; paying customers feel extorted for privacy.  
    - Product autocracy → A tiny PM class imposes fads (flat UIs, 3D TVs, now AI) on everyone — counterpoint: users must collectively resist and “move slower.”  
    - Historical reruns → Forced AI echoes Google+ and Windows bundling; people describe wasting effort, broken basics, and some finally switching to Linux or non‑AI tools.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Most frustration targets coercive integration and data grabs, not AI’s existence; opt‑out and reliability matter more than ideology.  
    - Impact: Expect migration to products and ecosystems that keep AI optional, transparent, and off by default.  
    - Watch next: Regulatory moves on data consent, platform-level AI disable switches, and independent benchmarks of non‑AI vs AI-enhanced UX.
