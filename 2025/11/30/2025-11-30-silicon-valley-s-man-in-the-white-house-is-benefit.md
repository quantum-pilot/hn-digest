# Silicon Valley's man in the White House is benefiting himself and his friends

### TL;DR
The article profiles David Sacks, Trump’s “A.I. and crypto czar,” arguing he’s using a powerful White House role to advance Silicon Valley allies and his own vast investment portfolio. He helped shape an A.I. policy “Action Plan” expected to massively benefit firms like Nvidia and hundreds of startups he’s invested in, while downplaying A.I. exposure in disclosures and clashing with national security advice. HN commenters see this as part of a broader pattern of normalized, bipartisan corruption and oligarch-style governance.

### Comment pulse
- Corruption is systemic, not isolated → Sacks is likened to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his un-audited Tether ties, all leveraging office for private crypto gains.  
- Current administration seen as grifter regime → Users argue most decisions are profit-driven, aiming for a Russia-style kleptocracy while distracting voters with culture-war outrage.  
- Structural cynicism fuels bad governance → Many Americans distrust government, so they tolerate conflicts of interest, enabling self-dealers to capture regulatory power—counterpoint: some still expect safeguards and enforcement.

### LLM perspective
- View: Blurring of policymaker and venture capitalist roles in A.I./crypto erodes legitimacy of both innovation policy and democratic institutions.  
- Impact: Benefits concentrated in already-powerful tech investors and platforms; national security, consumer protection, and smaller competitors risk being sidelined.  
- Watch next: Formal ethics rules on tech investments in office, independent audits (e.g., Tether), and congressional probes into A.I./crypto influence networks.
