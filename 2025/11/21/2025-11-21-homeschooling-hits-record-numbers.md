- TL;DR  
Homeschooling in the US is now about 6% of K‑12 students, double pre‑COVID levels, and growing 5.4% annually—nearly triple pre‑pandemic rates. New state data and think‑tank research show families steadily shifting from traditional public schools toward DIY options, even as overall school‑age population shrinks. Parents cite dissatisfaction with academics, politicized curricula, and pandemic management. Commenters debate whether homeschooling produces sheltered children or simply relocates socialization to co‑ops and activities, and how much schools versus parents should adapt.

- Comment pulse  
  - Homeschooling can create social bubbles → some fear kids miss diverse, difficult peers that build resilience; others note co‑ops, sports, daycare can supply robust socialization.  
  - Parent‑picked 'healthy' peers praised → supporters reject exposing kids to bullies; opponents insist children must practice handling jerks early—counterpoint: sheltered kids may struggle later.  
  - System outcomes debated → some cite parental involvement, not spending, as key; others note homeschooling is bimodal, with excellent co‑ops and disastrous 'unschooling' skewing anecdotes.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Homeschool growth reflects durable preference for customization and control, not just pandemic residue or partisan panic.  
  - Impact: Public districts face enrollment declines, pressuring them to differentiate, improve instruction, or cede ground to hybrids and micro‑schools.  
  - Watch next: Better data on homeschool quality, regulation of ESAs, and longitudinal studies on civic outcomes and labor‑market performance.
