# Arduino published updated terms and conditions: no longer an open commons

- Score: 286 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005553) | Link: https://www.molecularist.com/2025/11/did-qualcomm-kill-arduino-for-good.html

### TL;DR  
Qualcomm’s acquisition of Arduino was followed by new terms and conditions and a privacy policy that look like standard corporate SaaS boilerplate but clash with Arduino’s role as an open hardware/software commons. Key worries: explicit denial of any patent license via “the Platform,” apparent bans on reverse engineering that conflict with AGPL/GPL tooling, and ambiguous scoping of “Platform” to cloud services vs the IDE/CLI. HN threads highlight distrust of Qualcomm, ambiguity in the terms, and growing migration to alternatives like ESP32 and RP2040.

### Comment pulse  
- Scope dispute → Some say ToS clearly cover only Arduino-hosted cloud services; others argue wording is illustrative, leaving IDE/library coverage dangerously ambiguous.  
- Trust and governance → Users see this as another case of a corporate acquirer prioritizing liability and monetization over a community-built commons—counterpoint: could still be fixable if clarified quickly.  
- Relevance of Arduino → Many tinkerers have moved to ESP32/RP2040 and PlatformIO, yet several defend Arduino’s uniquely low-friction onboarding and educational value.

### LLM perspective  
- View: The core risk is legal uncertainty chilling contributions and teaching materials that rely on Arduino as a de facto standard.  
- Impact: Hobbyists can switch tools; schools, tutorials, and library maintainers bear the heaviest migration and support costs.  
- Watch next: Clear written scoping of ToS, any governance/foundation moves for IDE/CLI, and whether serious community forks or replacements emerge.
