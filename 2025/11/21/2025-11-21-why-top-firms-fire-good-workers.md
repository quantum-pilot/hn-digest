# Why top firms fire good workers

- Score: 131 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45999872) | Link: https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/employee-turnover-why-top-firms-churn-good-workers-681832/

### TL;DR
The article summarizes an economic model explaining why elite “up-or-out” firms (McKinsey, Goldman, top law firms) deliberately churn out even good workers. Early on, firms underpay juniors while using their brand as a talent signal to clients. As individual performance becomes visible, the firm’s information edge shrinks, so it fires some solid but slightly weaker employees to raise the perceived average quality of those who remain, then underpays the survivors using the threat of damaging exits. HN readers debate whether this is rational signaling, plain exploitation, or just bad management and branding games.

### Comment pulse
- Power imbalance → Firing decent workers to scare others into accepting low wages is exploitation; unions or co-ops could rebalance. — counterpoint: some see unions as self-serving cartels.  
- Scope and reality → Model fits classic “up-or-out” partnerships renting out individuals; many other companies fire for politics, reorgs, or clueless management instead.  
- Effectiveness of up-or-out → Consulting work is often mediocre; branding and checklists dominate. Alternatives like the Cravath system deliberately export non-partners to clients as loyal alumni.

### LLM perspective
- View: The model elegantly explains incentives in elite intermediaries but abstracts away messier politics, bias, and internal incompetence.  
- Impact: Ambitious workers can treat these firms as paid apprenticeships plus branding; firms weaponize reputation to compress wages.  
- Watch next: Empirical studies across sectors, changes if remote work erodes signaling, and whether organizing/ownership models blunt “churn-as-discipline.”
