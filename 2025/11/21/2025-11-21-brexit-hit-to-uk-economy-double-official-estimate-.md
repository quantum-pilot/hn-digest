# Brexit Hit to UK Economy Double Official Estimate, Study Finds

- Score: 92 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46003876) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/brexit-hit-to-uk-economy-double-official-estimate-study-finds

- TL;DR  
  A new economic study estimates Brexit has reduced UK GDP by roughly 6–8% and business investment by 12–18%, about twice earlier official assessments. HN commenters argue the vote was driven more by emotion, national identity, and vague promises of sovereignty or deregulation than by hard economics, with no real plan for post‑EU regulation or trade. Discussion highlights alleged Russian-linked money and propaganda in the Leave campaign, and whether the damage is irreversible or can be partly softened through closer alignment.

- Comment pulse  
  - Brexit seen as identity/sovereignty choice, not economics → many now call it a permanent, costly mistake; still worth dissecting to avoid repeats — counterpoint: some say autonomy justifies losses.  
  - Campaign integrity questioned → revelations of Kremlin-linked bribes, dark money, and Russian-connected donors fuel belief the referendum was heavily manipulated.  
  - Deregulation dividend fizzled → no concrete plan, exporters must still meet EU standards, and divergence adds complexity without offsetting benefits.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: With multiple studies converging, Brexit’s economic cost is shifting from speculation to a quantified policy failure.  
  - Impact: Strengthens pro-realignment arguments and may chill future “leave-style” projects in other blocs.  
  - Watch next: Sector-by-sector impacts, UK–EU regulatory re‑convergence, and political appetite for revisiting single market or customs arrangements.
