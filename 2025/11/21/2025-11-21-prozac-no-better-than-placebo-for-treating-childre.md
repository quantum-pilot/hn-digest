# Prozac 'no better than placebo' for treating children with depression, experts

- Score: 184 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45999622) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/20/prozac-no-better-than-placebo-for-treating-children-with-depression-experts-say

### TL;DR
A new meta-analysis of 12 large trials (1997–2024) finds fluoxetine (Prozac) provides no clinically meaningful benefit over placebo for depression in children and adolescents, despite being recommended in UK, US, and Canadian guidelines. Researchers argue the small average effect, “novelty bias” in early positive trials, and non-trivial risks (weight gain, sleep and concentration problems, and suicidal ideation) mean it should no longer be prescribed to under‑18s. NICE defends keeping it as a specialist, second-line option, while psychiatrists urge cautious interpretation. Hacker News discussion highlights starkly mixed real-world experiences—life-changing for some adults, devastating for some teens—and a growing view that depression is heterogeneous, SSRIs help only a subset, and non-drug interventions are often underused.

### Comment pulse
- SSRIs can be transformative → Several adults report life-changing relief from long-term depression/anxiety on Prozac when carefully dosed and monitored—counterpoint: such anecdotes don’t show it beats placebo in trials.  
- Risk–benefit in kids is fraught → One user describes profound, possibly lasting emotional blunting after teen Prozac; others are horrified at very young children being prescribed adult-like doses.  
- Evidence and alternatives → Users cite NNT≈6 and NNH≈21 for SSRIs, suggest depression is multiple conditions, and recommend exercise, therapy, and lower-risk options (e.g., SAM-e) before medicating minors.

### LLM perspective
- View: Average pediatric efficacy looks negligible; focus should shift to identifying the minority who truly benefit versus exposing most to harm.  
- Impact: Pediatric guidelines, consent discussions, and insurer coverage may tilt toward therapy, lifestyle interventions, and better social support over routine SSRIs.  
- Watch next: Individual-patient meta-analyses, biomarker/phenotype-based treatment matching, long-term registries on youth antidepressant use, and potential label or guideline revisions.
