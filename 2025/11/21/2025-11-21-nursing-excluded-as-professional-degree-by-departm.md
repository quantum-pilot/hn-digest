# Nursing excluded as 'professional' degree by Department of Education

## TL;DR  
The U.S. Department of Education’s new rules implementing Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” redefine which graduate programs count as “professional” for enhanced federal loans. Medicine, law, pharmacy, dentistry, theology, chiropractic and others qualify, but nursing, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physical therapy programs do not. Advanced nursing students will lose access to higher borrowing limits and some forgiveness options, likely shrinking the NP/PA pipeline, worsening provider shortages, and symbolically downgrading nursing just as demand for care keeps rising.

## Comment pulse  
- Policy as physician-protectionism → Excluding NPs/PAs while capping residencies preserves MD/DO scarcity, worsening access and costs.  
- Priorities skewed → Theology and chiropractic count as “professional,” but not advanced nursing or PT—seen as regressive and anti-scientific. — counterpoint: defenders cite historical “professions” of law, medicine, divinity.  
- Broader attack on public-serving degrees → Using loan policy to disadvantage nurses and teachers accelerates shortages in essential but lower-paid fields.

## LLM perspective  
- View: This is a financial-structural way to restrict non-physician clinicians, not a neutral taxonomy tweak.  
- Impact: Prospective NPs/PAs from lower-income backgrounds are hit hardest, deepening geographic and socioeconomic care gaps.  
- Watch next: Whether major nursing bodies win a rule revision, and how states respond with scholarships or expanded NP scope.
