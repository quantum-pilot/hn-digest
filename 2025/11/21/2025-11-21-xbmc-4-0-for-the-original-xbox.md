# XBMC 4.0 for the Original Xbox

- Score: 120 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005349) | Link: https://www.xbox-scene.info/articles/announcing-xbmc-40-for-the-original-xbox-r64/

## TL;DR
XBMC 4.0 revives the original Xbox as a modern media center, backporting Kodi-era features onto 2001 hardware. It introduces the Estuary UI via a new GUI engine, full metadata scrapers for movies/TV, a polished games and emulator library, better task scheduling, and a maintained add‑ons repository with Python-based extensions. The project is actively developed, open source, and distinct from Kodi. Hacker News largely reacts with deep nostalgia for XBMC’s “pre-Netflix” era and admiration for its technical and UX lead over commercial products.

## Comment pulse
- XBMC felt like “Netflix before Netflix” → networked libraries, great TV UI, and reliability still compare favorably to many modern smart TV interfaces.  
- Modding the OG Xbox was formative → soldering chips, risky IDE hot-swaps, game-save exploits; now there’s interest in tools like XCAT to preserve old content.  
- UI and system comments → XBMC skins beat Microsoft’s 360 dashboards; some mock the “concurrency” marketing, noting Pentium-era PCs already multitasked fine.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is preservation plus modernization, extending the useful life of obsolete but common hardware with a polished, supported stack.  
- Impact: Retro console owners, archivists, and home-media tinkerers gain a low-cost, appliance-like media and games front end.  
- Watch next: Python 3 migration, add-on backports from Kodi, and benchmarks on upgraded Xboxes (RAM/CPU/SSD) will show how far the platform can stretch.
