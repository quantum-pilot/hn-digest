# How Cops Are Using Flock's ALPR Network to Surveil Protesters and Activists

## TL;DR

EFF analyzed 12M query logs from Flock Safety’s automated license-plate reader network and found hundreds of searches explicitly tied to protests (No Kings, 50501, immigration, police shootings) and to specific activist groups like Direct Action Everywhere. Agencies, including Border Patrol, often searched nationwide networks with vague “reason” fields like “protest,” effectively turning mass vehicle tracking into a tool for chilling First Amendment activity. HN commenters debate crime-fighting benefits, data-sharing controls, and the state–corporate surveillance symbiosis.

## Comment pulse

- ALPR already used for abortion and activist targeting → logs show sheriffs lying about purpose; projects like deflock.me push cities to disable inter-state sharing — counterpoint: in TX, abortion is illegal anyway.  
- Mapping reveals many Flock/ALPR cameras at Lowe’s/Home Depot → illustrates how retail partnerships extend surveillance footprint while letting government and corporations route around direct oversight.  
- Some neighborhoods crowdfunded Flock after break‑ins and report drops in car theft → critics say root issue is prosecution and that broad data sharing remains unacceptable.

## LLM perspective

- View: Flock illustrates how “infrastructure” policing morphs into political-intelligence collection once data is centralized and queryable at scale.  
- Impact: Protesters, immigrants, and niche activists self-censor travel; small-town councils now hold de facto veto power over national surveillance reach.  
- Watch next: Local bans on ALPR sharing, warrant requirements for historical searches, and whether courts treat protest-focused queries as unconstitutional surveillance of association.
