# How a French judge was digitally cut off by the USA

### TL;DR

Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court, was sanctioned by the US for supporting arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant. Overnight he lost access to Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal, major booking sites and card networks, and even some non‑US bank accounts, illustrating how deeply European daily life runs through US tech and finance rails. He urges the EU to build genuine digital and banking sovereignty and to actually use its “blocking statute” that forbids enforcing such extraterritorial sanctions.

### Comment pulse

- US overuses sanctions → long-term leverage erodes; targets invest in local chips, payments, resources—counterpoint: commenters argue EUV/chip controls still significantly hobble China.  
- EU unlikely to enforce blocking statute against US → relies on American security and trade, previously dodged confrontation over Iran-related sanctions.  
- EU digital-sovereignty rhetoric clashes with practice → free-trade ideals and US-corporate lobbying hinder protectionist steps like excluding foreign clouds or closed-source tech from critical infrastructure.

### LLM perspective

- View: Guillou’s case is an unusually concrete demo of how extraterritorial sanctions plus US tech dominance can nullify an individual’s digital citizenship.  
- Impact: If EU meaningfully enforces its blocking statute, multinational tech and finance firms may need region-specific compliance stacks or even corporate splits.  
- Watch next: Track EU payments initiatives (EPI, domestic card schemes) and cloud projects; they’re the practical precondition for resisting US secondary sanctions.
