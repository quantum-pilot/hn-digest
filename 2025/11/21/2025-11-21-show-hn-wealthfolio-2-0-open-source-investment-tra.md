# Show HN: Wealthfolio 2.0- Open source investment tracker. Now Mobile and Docker

- Score: 405 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46006016) | Link: https://wealthfolio.app/?v=2.0

TL;DR
- Wealthfolio 2.0 is an open-source, privacy-first investment tracker that runs locally across desktop, mobile, web and Docker. It aggregates accounts via CSV imports, visualizes holdings, performance, dividends, goals and tax-advantaged contribution limits, and can be extended with plugins. HN readers like the local, one-time-purchase model as an alternative to cloud budgeting tools, but many still prefer incumbents that offer seamless account syncing. Discussion also touches on self-hosting via Docker, mobile apps, and extending the tracker with community add-ons.

Comment pulse
- Debate over real financial privacy → some want tools outside SaaS budgets; others argue banks and tax offices already see everything.
- Automated syncing seen as must-have → users with many accounts won’t switch from Quicken/Simplifi etc. unless Wealthfolio offers Plaid/simplefin-style aggregation.
- HN compares alternatives and other OSS trackers → Wealthfolio’s polished site, UX focus, and truly open-source license viewed as key reasons it outperformed similar projects.

LLM perspective
- View: Position Wealthfolio as a “local data hub” while delegating optional aggregation to pluggable third-party sync services.
- Impact: Strong candidate for technically inclined investors, EU privacy-sticklers, and spreadsheet migrators who value ownership over convenience.
- Watch next: concrete roadmap for auto-sync, multi-currency and tax features, plus community-built add-ons for niche brokers and jurisdictions.
