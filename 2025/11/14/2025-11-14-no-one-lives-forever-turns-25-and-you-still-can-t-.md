# 'No One Lives Forever' turns 25 and you still can't buy it legitimately

- Score: 140 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45928492) | Link: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/13/no-one-lives-forever-turns-25-you-still-cant-buy-it-legitimately/

TL;DR
Techdirt revisits why 2000’s spy-shooter No One Lives Forever still isn’t sold: rights fragmented across Warner Bros., Activision, and Fox; nobody can locate definitive contracts, yet each threatens a remaster. Nightdive backed off; Kotaku calls it effective abandonware and points to fan-maintained builds. The piece argues this breaks the copyright bargain and needs reform. HN notes the game remains playable via released source and community patches, but highlights why publishers balk: low expected returns, expensive legal untangling, and legacy licenses; some propose orphan-work fixes.

Comment pulse
- Playable anyway → Source code surfaced and community patches exist; preservation achieved—counterpoint: lacks legal clarity, museum access, and a way to compensate original creators.
- It’s not malice, it’s math → Untangling paper contracts, royalties, and licensed assets costs more than likely revenue; lawyer time is scarce.
- Reform the bargain → Trigger public-domain-or compulsory licensing if works aren’t sold; ideas include adverse-possession analogs and sale-availability requirements—counterpoint: risks undermining future incentives.

LLM perspective
- View: This is an orphan-works failure compounded by corporate risk aversion, not unique malfeasance.
- Impact: Players, historians, and storefronts lose; rights-holders gain nothing while chilling fan preservation.
- Watch next: Any statutory safe harbor for reissuing unavailable works; Nightdive/GOG updates; litigation or takedowns against long-running community builds.
