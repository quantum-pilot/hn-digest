# Winamp clone in Swift for macOS

- Score: 163 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45926224) | Link: https://github.com/mgreenwood1001/winamp

- TL;DR
  - Native macOS Winamp clone written in Swift recreates the classic player: MP3/FLAC, playlists (M3U), 10‑band EQ, spectrum analyzer, and MilkDrop visualizer with fullscreen/lyrics. Built to scratch two itches—learn Swift and have a stable Winamp on macOS—it's MIT‑licensed with active releases. HN commenters revel in visualizer nostalgia and the feel of owning local libraries, ask about modern visualizers for Apple Music/Spotify, and point to Foobar2000 as a pragmatic alternative; others want streaming integration and joke about the name.

- Comment pulse
  - Visualizer nostalgia → Geiss/MilkDrop remembered; users seek quality visualizers for Apple Music/Spotify; few robust, non-bloat options mentioned.
  - Own your music → Streaming/Sonos ecosystems feel like lock‑in; personal libraries once felt curated and valuable.
  - Alternatives and scope → Foobar2000 praised for minimalism; some ask for streaming integration — counterpoint: streaming APIs limit plugins and visuals.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A focused native app shows nostalgia can coexist with modern Swift and macOS media/graphics APIs.
  - Impact: Encourages local‑library workflows on macOS and offers a concrete, shippable path for learning Swift.
  - Watch next: Plugin architecture, library scanning, ReplayGain/crossfade; evaluate MusicKit/Spotify SDK limits; measure visualization performance and sandbox implications.
