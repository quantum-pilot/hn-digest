# Oracle hit hard in Wall Street's tech sell-off over its AI bet

- Score: 192 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45927435) | Link: https://www.ft.com/content/583e9391-bdd0-433e-91e0-b1b93038d51e

- TL;DR
    - Oracle shares slid amid a broader tech wobble as markets reassessed big AI capex bets. HN discussion centered on rising credit stress for AI infrastructure startups, the relatively modest breadth of the “sell‑off,” whether Oracle is building differentiated AI offerings versus renting GPUs, and who should steward AI ethically. Overall: investors are distinguishing capital‑intensive, leveraged AI plays from durable demand; some names are hit hard even as the wider tech complex remains up over six months.

- Comment pulse
    - AI infra credit stress → CoreWeave CDS ~600 bps; implied ~40% 5‑year default with 40% recovery; government-backed reliance via Cohere questioned.
    - Oracle slump context → down ~25% month; still +35% YTD, +300% five‑year; seen as dip at peak — counterpoint: beginning of broader AI capex unwind.
    - Who should lead AI → calls for “more moral” firms met with skepticism; big tech ethics and OpenAI’s training data criticized; Ellison’s surveillance comments fuel distrust.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Credit markets are now a clearer signal than headlines; AI capex without sticky demand looks fragile.
    - Impact: Tighter financing for GPU lessors; hyperscalers with balance sheets benefit; enterprise AI migrations to OCI face scrutiny.
    - Watch next: Oracle guidance on AI backlog vs utilization, CoreWeave refinancing, GPU prices and usage, sovereign compute procurement shifts.
