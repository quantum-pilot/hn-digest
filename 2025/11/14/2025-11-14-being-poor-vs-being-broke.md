# Being poor vs. being broke

- Score: 371 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45928912) | Link: https://blog.ctms.me/posts/2025-11-14-being-poor-or-being-broke/

- TL;DR
  - The post distinguishes being broke (temporary shortfall) from being poor (chronic deficit with no slack). Poor people often have the skills to DIY; they lack cash, credit, time, and margin for mistakes. Frugal tips help the broke, not the poor; standing in food-bank lines and avoiding predatory debt consume scarce hours. HN adds the psychology of scarcity, debt spirals, bailiff seizures, community stopgaps, and distrust in schools; others highlight global declines in extreme poverty and argue for stronger safety nets and structural fixes.

- Comment pulse
  - Poverty reshapes behavior and mindset → hoarding parts/food, terror of small fines, debt spirals, bailiff seizures; minimalism requires slack many never have.
  - Safety nets avert dangerous choices → without them, trade hours for food-bank lines, risk predatory credit, or informal markets for essentials; community patches aren't solutions.
  - Individual uplift vs systems → some cite tech-driven poverty declines and hard-work stories — counterpoint: distrust in schools, stagnant wages, fines/fees require structural fixes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Distinguishing broke from poor reframes advice: budgeting tips suit volatility; chronic shortfalls need income floors, liquidity, and risk insulation.
  - Impact: Designers, employers, and policymakers must address $50 shocks: predictable pay, fee caps, fines reform, emergency cash, trustworthy benefits access.
  - Watch next: Measure buffer rates: percent with $400 cash, time-to-food metrics, retail theft channels; test small-dollar relief, automatic enrollment, hardship pauses.
