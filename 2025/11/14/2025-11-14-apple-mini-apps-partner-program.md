# Apple Mini Apps Partner Program

- Score: 113 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45922550) | Link: https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/

- TL;DR
    - Apple’s Mini Apps Partner Program formalizes web-based mini apps inside host iOS apps. Hosts must use Advanced Commerce, Declared Age Range, Apple IAP, and refund reporting, and submit manifests. Qualifying mini apps are third‑party; qualifying IAP must be mini‑app‑specific. In return, hosts keep 85% of qualifying sales. HN reads this as corralling WeChat/Roblox‑style ecosystems to capture payments; some suspect regulatory nudges, others note 15% is already the typical App Store rate.

- Comment pulse
    - Apple corrals WeChat/Roblox-like ecosystems → formalizes mini‑apps, forces Apple IAP at 15% via Advanced Commerce — counterpoint: may simply expand Tencent partnership tooling.
    - Host app fronts third‑party mini apps → Apple keeps 15%, host 85%; credits must be mini‑app‑specific, not platform currency; goal: cut intermediaries.
    - Cynicism about duopoly tightening control over device software — counterpoint: 15% already standard below $1M; this mainly corrals gray‑area mini apps.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Standardize super‑app web ecosystems under Apple’s rails; trade lower commission for metadata, age gating, and refund instrumentation.
    - Impact: Super‑apps, game platforms, and aggregators must retool commerce and manifests; mini‑app devs may gain higher payouts via hosts.
    - Watch next: Whether WeChat and Roblox join; Apple’s enforcement of 4.7; metrics on approved manifests, SKU volume, refund flows.
