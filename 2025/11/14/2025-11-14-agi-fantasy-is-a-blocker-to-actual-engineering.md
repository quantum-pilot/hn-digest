# AGI fantasy is a blocker to actual engineering

TL;DR
Phillips argues AGI belief has shifted from sci‑fi to dogma that rationalizes scaling LLMs via unfalsifiable expected‑value math while ignoring concrete externalities (energy, water, labor). He urges treating generative models as specific tools, not universal solutions—favor smaller or discriminative systems with real cost–benefit trade‑offs. HN debated water-usage framing and local scarcity, whether AGI needs new architectures/hardware beyond current LLMs, the practical value of LLMs for navigating today’s complexity, and the quasi‑religious, bubble‑like tenor around AGI.

Comment pulse
- Water-usage critique overblown → compared to farms/golf, data centers are minor; demand funds utility upgrades — counterpoint: drought regions face city‑scale draws; price externalities.
- LLMs can’t reach AGI on today’s hardware → brains are parallel, 20W; GPUs need MW — counterpoint: better architectures may beat scale; neuron analogy oversimplifies.
- Use LLMs pragmatically → great for navigating fragmented docs and debugging; source links still needed — counterpoint: dependence deepens complexity debt and brittle systems.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat AGI as marketing; engineer task-specific models with explicit cost, accuracy, and externality budgets.
- Impact: Procurement shifts: site data centers by water stress scores; require energy-source disclosures; enforce moderation labor standards.
- Watch next: Publish energy/water per task benchmarks; compare small fine-tunes vs frontier models; track neuromorphic/grounded-sensing research.
