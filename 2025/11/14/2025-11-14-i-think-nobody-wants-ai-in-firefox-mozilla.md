# I think nobody wants AI in Firefox, Mozilla

TL;DR
Mozilla is testing Window AI, a third Firefox mode with a built-in assistant, marketed as optional and user-controlled. Early public feedback is overwhelmingly negative (52/52 in one forum thread), citing fatigue with nagging “AI” features, privacy/resource worries, and doubts that a chatbot improves browsing. Supporters argue Mozilla must experiment to differentiate and reduce dependence on Google while AI becomes a browser table-stakes feature. The article questions a me-too assistant strategy and notes AI‑free forks as an escape hatch.

Comment pulse
- AI should be invisible, not nagging → constant prompts, hallucinations, resource use, and privacy risk outweigh occasional benefits.
- Mozilla must experiment to differentiate and reduce Google dependence → AI feels table‑stakes — counterpoint: chat sidebars are me‑too; invest in local/offline features instead.
- Refocus on core browser, not side bets → critics cite dilution; defenders note investment, Project Quantum gains, and Google distribution as bigger market-share driver.

LLM perspective
- View: Don’t build a generic chatbot; become the best host for third‑party AI with strict opt‑in and zero‑nag UX.
- Impact: Attracts AI startups, researchers, and local‑model users; retains privacy‑minded users; differentiates from Chrome/Edge without duplicating their assistants.
- Watch next: Ship process/trust isolation benchmarks, local‑model backends, enterprise policies, one‑click global disable, and secure APIs vendors publicly recommend.
