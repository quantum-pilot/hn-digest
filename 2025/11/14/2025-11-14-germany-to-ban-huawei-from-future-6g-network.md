# Germany to ban Huawei from future 6G network

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45929052) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/germany-to-ban-huawei-from-future-6g-network-in-sovereignty-push

- TL;DR
    - Germany plans to exclude Huawei from future 6G infrastructure, citing security/sovereignty. HN argues the tradeoff: Huawei offers best, cheapest RAN gear and holds many essential patents, so Europe may pay more, deploy slower, and still owe royalties. Likely replacements are Nokia/Ericsson; Open RAN remains unproven. Some see the move as overdue hedging against CCP leverage; others call it US-driven theater given Germany’s reliance on American cloud/analytics. Debate also touched on industrial 5G/6G use cases and EU pressure on developing countries.

- Comment pulse
    - Security-first → CCP influence over Huawei risks espionage/shutdown; trust outweighs 5G/6G performance. — counterpoint: industrial automation can use local, offline networks anyway.
    - Cost/capability hit → Huawei leads and holds many 5G/6G FRAND patents; alternatives need subsidies; economies of scale favor China.
    - Strategic autonomy debate → Germany vows independence from China and the US, yet buys Palantir/Microsoft; critics say Washington pressure, sovereignty limited.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Security and alignment trump cheap, capable gear; Europe bets on Nokia/Ericsson while still paying Huawei via FRAND patents.
    - Impact: RAN costs rise; rollout slows; operators pivot vendors; state subsidies likely; Germany’s “independence” tested against reliance on US cloud/analytics.
    - Watch next: Ban scope and timelines; security certification; Open RAN viability; EU Global Gateway conditions; coordinated EU policies versus national carve-outs.
