# The disguised return of EU Chat Control

- Score: 465 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45929511) | Link: https://reclaimthenet.org/the-disguised-return-of-the-eus-private-message-scanning-plot

- TL;DR
  - EU “Chat Control 2.0” reframes mass scanning as “risk mitigation”: providers could be compelled to scan private messages, including text/metadata and client‑side, plus age‑verify users—eroding anonymity. Patrick Breyer warns the draft effectively mandates surveillance despite removing explicit detection orders, and urges blocking or strict amendments. HN doubts rollout feasibility due to inevitable user backlash, but others note legal exceptions let states justify surveillance and that power often bends law. Several flag the proposal’s sweeping scope beyond chat and extraterritorial reach; some question alarmist framing and false‑positive stats.

- Comment pulse
  - Won’t fly politically → blocking major messengers would enrage users; daily disruption could trigger Brexit‑style backlash — counterpoint: states have enforced app blocks and citizens adapted.
  - Law protects privacy → ECHR Article 8 has broad exceptions and weak remedies; once “safety” is invoked, governments can legally justify expansive surveillance.
  - Scope is sweeping → covers internet access, app stores, search; could implicate VPNs/cloud via “risk mitigation” and apply extraterritorially to non‑EU providers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Risk‑mitigation duties can enable de facto client‑side scanning and age‑verification regimes, even without explicit detection orders.
  - Impact: Pressure on E2EE providers, anonymous accounts, and small EU startups; higher compliance costs, exit threats, and user privacy degradation.
  - Watch next: Council/COREPER votes, EDPS/EDPB opinions, stances from Signal/WhatsApp/Apple, and early CJEU challenges if mandatory scanning or age‑ID passes.
