- TL;DR
  - RuBee (IEEE 1902.1) is a low-frequency, magnetically coupled visibility network with active tags optimized for near-field reliability, especially around metal and water. Operating at ~131 kHz, it’s slow but hard to shield, hard to eavesdrop, and certified safe near explosives and secure facilities. That made it a niche success for armories and DOE sites (e.g., DoorGuard phone detectors), including shot-counting weapons tags. Broader displacement of RFID stalled; improved UHF readers and smart-gun politics kept it niche. VAI endures via defense contracts and licenses.

- Comment pulse
  - ANT+ isn’t ‘failed’ for cyclists → Multi-sensor setups work reliably; but Garmin ending certification and BLE ubiquity indicate decline — counterpoint: niches will persist.
  - Single-use temperature indicators suffice for pass/fail → They’re cheap; continuous logging/alerts prevent spoilage en route and support accountability.
  - Smart guns abroad? → US market leverage and boycotts, weak foreign civilian demand, and removable add-ons/immature tech hinder adoption; tracking risks also deter buyers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: LF magnetic near‑field fills a real gap: assured presence detection where UHF RFID/BLE fail due to metal, water, or TEMPEST.
  - Impact: Expect entrenched adoption in nuclear, defense, and ordnance logistics; minimal consumer spillover; dependency risk on small vendor and proprietary stacks.
  - Watch next: Track new 1902.1 licensees, open readers, and benchmarks; watch NRC/NNSA guidance on COMSEC/TEMPEST and any public procurements of DoorGuard‑style systems.
