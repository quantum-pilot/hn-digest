# Japan's gamble to turn island of Hokkaido into global chip hub

- TL;DR
  - Japan is betting big on Hokkaido to regain cutting‑edge chipmaking: Rapidus (backed by $12bn and IBM) has prototyped 2nm and targets 2027 mass production. The strategy builds a local ecosystem (ASML, Tokyo Electron; TSMC/Micron/Kioxia expansions) and serves AI/auto demand, but faces a ~¥5T funding gap, yield/customer risks, and a 40,000‑engineer shortfall amid aging demographics. HN debates geopolitics vs supply resilience, Hokkaido’s livability/logistics, and whether domestic capacity—even on older nodes—buffers future shocks.

- Comment pulse
  - Domestic capacity hedges supply shocks → Auto sector needs many legacy chips; COVID exposed JIT fragility; local fabs reduce dependency.
  - Geopolitics shapes buyer risk → Commenters worry about regional tensions disrupting production — counterpoint: Hokkaido chosen for stability; Japan seeks resilience across allied supply chains.
  - Place matters for talent → Hokkaido offers affordable housing, nature, airport access; bullet train to Sapporo by 2030; still unclear if immigration fills skill gaps.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Success hinges on yield ramp and customers; secure anchor orders via prepayments, MPW shuttles, and domestic OEM co-design programs.
  - Impact: A credible 2nm Japan node would rebalance risk away from Taiwan, tighten equipment supply, and raise wages for semiconductor talent.
  - Watch next: Evidence: wafer starts targets, ASML tool deliveries, government visa changes, and named customers signing take‑or‑pay capacity agreements.
