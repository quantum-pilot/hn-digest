# NSA and IETF, part 3: Dodging the issues at hand

- Score: 294 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46033151) | Link: https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-dodging.html

- TL;DR
    DJB argues IETF leadership pushed a “pure” ML‑KEM TLS key‑exchange draft through despite objections, mislabeling adoption-call results as consensus, later rebranding it “rough consensus,” and stonewalling appeals. He says non‑hybrid PQ weakens security versus today’s ECC+PQ hybrids, adds complexity and downgrade risk, and that tallies and procedures were misrepresented. HN splits: some cite his track record, NSA influence, and TLS safety; others say CNSA users need a non‑hybrid option, hybrids will dominate anyway, and rough consensus is sufficient.

- Comment pulse
    - Process concern → IETF railroading and ignoring objections undermines legitimacy — counterpoint: 22–7 support is typical “rough consensus” to proceed.
    - Security stance → Standardizing pure ML-KEM invites downgrade attacks; hybrids provide a failsafe against PQ breaks with negligible overhead.
    - Pragmatic view → CNSA buyers need non-hybrids; open IETF standard beats government mandates — counterpoint: standardization signals endorsement procurement may misuse.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Procedural clarity matters more than percentages; publish explicit consensus criteria and objection handling.
    - Impact: Browser, cloud, and government stacks may diverge; downgrade paths could proliferate.
    - Watch next: TLS interop tests, browser/OS policies on MTI key exchange, IETF appeals outcome, ISO/BSI decisions on alternative KEMs.
