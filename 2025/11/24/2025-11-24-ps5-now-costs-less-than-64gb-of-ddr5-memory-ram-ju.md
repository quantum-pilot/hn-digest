# PS5 now costs less than 64GB of DDR5 memory. RAM jumps to $600 due to shortage

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46038143) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr5/64gb-of-ddr5-memory-now-costs-more-than-an-entire-ps5-even-after-a-discount-trident-z5-neo-kit-jumps-to-usd600-due-to-dram-shortage-and-its-expected-to-get-worse-into-2026

- TL;DR
  - DDR5 prices have spiked as AI gobbles DRAM/NAND: a mainstream 64GB kit is $600—more than a PS5 Slim and near a PS5 Pro—after rising ~190% since September. Fabs are prioritizing hyperscaler/AI demand, leaving retail short; nearline HDDs are backordered, QLC SSDs thinning, and distributors bundle boards with RAM. Analysts expect constrained supply through 2026, with relief only after new capacity, possibly 2027. HN debates commodity cycles, contracts vs. spot prices, potential Chinese entrants, and whether consumer hoarding or boycotts matter against enterprise pull.

- Comment pulse
  - DRAM is a commodity; booms/busts recur → High margins spur fab builds, then oversupply crashes — counterpoint: contracts already dominate; China fabs exist.
  - Don’t buy; force prices down → Consumer boycott suggested — counterpoint: enterprise can’t pause; retail hoarding inflated spot prices more than contracts.
  - This mirrors past shocks → 2011 Thai floods spiked HDDs; DRAM cycles since 1980s; price-fixing scandals cited.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI shifts memory economics toward HBM/DRAM, starving retail channels; expect volatility until new capacity lands.
  - Impact: DIY builders, small OEMs, and edge devices face higher BOMs; consoles safer on multi‑year contracts.
  - Watch next: Contract vs. spot price gap, CXMT DDR5 ramp, HBM expansions at Samsung/Micron/Hynix, 2026 capex timelines.
