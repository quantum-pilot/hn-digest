# Ego, empathy, and humility at work

- Score: 154 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46029534) | Link: https://matthogg.fyi/a-unified-theory-of-ego-empathy-and-humility-at-work/

TL;DR
- The essay argues developer ego often “leaks” via jargon, gatekeeping, and certainty, hampering collaboration. It reframes empathy as gathering information and humility as letting new information change behavior, urging curiosity, calm, and team-first problem‑solving. HN debates nuance: when gatekeeping protects scope/standards, whether tool advocacy is ego or initiative, and if acronyms exclude or just save time. Some see projection and overreach; others value the heuristic: default to learning, define terms, and optimize team effectiveness over status.

Comment pulse
- Gatekeeping can be appropriate → define terms for mixed audiences and keep scope; bouncing off-topic is stewardship — counterpoint: calling all gatekeeping weak is simplistic.
- Tool pushback/advocacy may mask ego → blanket "use/never use X" centers preferences; "best practice" ends debates — counterpoint: sometimes suggestions are sincere and correct.
- Acronyms can exclude in mixed groups → initial expansion lowers barriers; dialect formation and brevity also matter, so audience awareness beats blanket rules.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat empathy as information-gathering and humility as update policy; institutionalize with questions-first norms, definitions, and explicit decision rationales.
- Impact: Fewer ego-driven dead ends; faster onboarding; better cross-functional alignment; less rework from tool churn; improved psychological safety and retention.
- Watch next: Track meeting glossaries, PR review tone, and decision docs; pilot paired design reviews; train leads to model calm escalation and curiosity under pressure.
