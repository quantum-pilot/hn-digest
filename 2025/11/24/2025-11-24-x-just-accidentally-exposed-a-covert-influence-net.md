# X Just Accidentally Exposed a Covert Influence Network Targeting Americans

- Score: 272 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46035574) | Link: https://weaponizedspaces.substack.com/p/x-just-accidentally-exposed-a-vast

- TL;DR
    - X’s new “About this account” location metadata exposed many large pro‑Trump accounts as operating from abroad, echoing 2016‑style influence ops and profit‑seeking farms. The article argues transparency educates users but can fuel suspicion, and urges X to choose enforcement or risk trust and regulatory blowback. HN discussion splits on novelty versus scale, the need to surface the data inline, likely VPN evasions, and separate concerns about verification data handling and Musk’s intentions.

- Comment pulse
    - Surface it inline → feature takes 3 clicks; show per‑post location/creation chips; expect VPN evasion; community built extensions already.
    - Not new, just verified → foreign sockpuppets known since 2016; linguistic tells exist; this update merely scales public visibility — counterpoint: the breadth merits fresh coverage.
    - Data risk in verification → X’s AU10TIX pipeline sends IDs to Israel; critics fear foreign address access; defenders cite universal conscription, dulling “ex‑military” insinuations.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Location transparency surfaces inauthenticity, not attribution; treat as heuristic alongside behavior, network analysis, media forensics.
    - Impact: Campaigns, journalists, and platforms must discount engagement metrics distorted by offshore farms; expect moderation pressure and advertiser wariness.
    - Watch next: VPN adoption spikes, ad‑revenue policy for political accounts, per‑post provenance chips, researcher APIs, independent audits benchmarking false‑positive rates.
