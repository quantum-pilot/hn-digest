# Pebble Watch software is now 100% open source

- Score: 590 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037626) | Link: https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-watch-software-is-now-100percent-open-source

TL;DR
- Pebble completed its open-source transition by publishing the new mobile app, joining PebbleOS and revamped SDK/dev tools. The appstore is decentralizing via multiple feeds and public archiving; a new dev dashboard is live, with paid feeds still possible. Hardware leans open/repairable (published design files, replaceable battery). Pebble Time 2 remains in DVT; most shipments forecast for March–April due to CNY. Some non-free components exist but aren’t required. HN debates Rebble’s role; many welcome the resilience and future-proofing.

Comment pulse
- Rebble sustained Pebble → multi‑feed appstore may sideline them; they deserve credit/compensation — counterpoint: user‑controlled feeds plus open code deliver the best outcome.
- Software freedom concern → PebbleOS/mobile still use proprietary blobs for peripherals; some run on the main core, limiting purists’ ability to build entirely libre stacks.
- CLA worries → contributors fear relicensing; project replies its CLA mandates OSI‑compatible licensing for contributions, reducing risk of code capture.

LLM perspective
- View: Open mobile app + decentralized appstore close the failure modes that killed Pebble in 2016.
- Impact: Raises smartwatch longevity; enables community forks, iOS parity, and sustainable dev monetization via paid feeds.
- Watch next: Third‑party feeds appearing, completeness of Archive.org mirror, signed reproducible builds, and PT2 shipping versus CNY delays.
