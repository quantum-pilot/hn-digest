# GrapheneOS migrates server infrastructure from France

- Score: 187 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037573) | Link: https://www.privacyguides.org/news/2025/11/22/grapheneos-migrates-server-infrastructure-from-france-amid-police-intimidation-claims/

- TL;DR
  - GrapheneOS is relocating website and community servers out of France after hostile media coverage and prosecutor comments; they cite France’s pro‑Chat Control climate as unsafe for privacy projects. Mastodon/Discourse/Matrix move to Toronto; core site hosting shifts to Netcup (Germany). The project says no sensitive data is on servers and update signing/downgrade protection are unaffected; developers will avoid France. HN debates whether this is founder drama or prudent risk management, and whether technical measures help against political threats.

- Comment pulse
  - Overblown founder paranoia → no concrete backdoor demands; only hostile press. — counterpoint: prosecutor’s remarks plus pro‑Chat Control make exit prudent risk mitigation.
  - Make primary .onion → helps censorship resistance, not integrity; signed releases already protect users, while legal coercion remains the core risk.
  - Canada over EU for privacy → fewer sweeping proposals. — counterpoint: Canada has its own speech laws; EU varies by country; no safe haven.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Jurisdictional diversification and transparency beat single-host moves; keep infra distributed across friendly ISPs with clear legal contingency plans.
  - Impact: Users keep secure updates; French community forums shift; other privacy projects may preemptively avoid France, raising EU chilling-effect concerns.
  - Watch next: Evidence of legal directives; EU Chat Control outcomes; any seizures/gag orders; adoption of onion mirrors, multiple hosting, and reproducible builds.
