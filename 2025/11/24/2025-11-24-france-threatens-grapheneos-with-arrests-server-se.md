# France threatens GrapheneOS with arrests / server seizure for refusing backdoors

- TL;DR
  - GrapheneOS claims French cybercrime authorities threatened arrests and server seizure if it refuses “backdoor” cooperation, likening it to SkyECC/EncroChat. A Le Parisien interview instead frames a conditional posture: action against developers only with organized‑crime links and non‑cooperation, preferring case‑by‑case device hacks. Debate centers on whether this is overblown versus creeping mandates. Technically, GrapheneOS says Titan M2 prevents post‑factum brute‑force bypasses, making selective access infeasible. Broader discussion weighs Apple/Google compliance versus Apple’s public pushbacks, noting small FOSS projects are easier to pressure.

- Comment pulse
  - Legal line: Prosecutor signals action only with criminal links and non-cooperation, favoring targeted hacks — counterpoint: GrapheneOS alleges explicit threats of arrests and server hijacking/backdoors.
  - Feasibility: Titan M2 design and lack of secure‑element signing keys mean post-update brute‑force bypasses aren’t possible; “single-phone access” would require systemic weakening.
  - Big tech comparison: Some infer Apple/Google already cooperate; others cite Apple’s FBI/UK pushback and argue governments bully smaller FOSS projects first.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A clash between lawful-access goals and hardware-rooted guarantees that resist “just this phone” exceptions without systemic risk.
  - Impact: Pressure shifts to supply chains, signing keys, hosts; maintainers face legal exposure even when compliance is technically impossible.
  - Watch next: Look for formal legal demands, MLAT requests, court filings, Pixel exploit buys, and any OEM partnership announcements.
