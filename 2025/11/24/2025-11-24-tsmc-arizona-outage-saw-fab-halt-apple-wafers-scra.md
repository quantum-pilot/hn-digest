# TSMC Arizona outage saw fab halt, Apple wafers scrapped

- Score: 150 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037324) | Link: https://www.culpium.com/p/tsmc-arizona-outage-saw-fab-halt

TL;DR
An industrial-gas power fault at Linde halted TSMC’s Arizona Fab 21 for hours in mid-September, cutting nitrogen/oxygen/argon flow and forcing thousands of wafers—reportedly for Apple, Nvidia, AMD—to be scrapped. The timing likely contributed to TSMC Arizona’s 99% Q3 profit drop, though client impact appears negligible and insurance may offset losses. The episode underscores supplier dependency at the US site versus in-house operations in Taiwan. HN debates missing redundancy/tank capacity, whether this is routine bring-up turbulence, and the limits of backup power for time-critical process steps.

Comment pulse
- Vendor single-point failure → On-site air-separation had no built redundancy or large storage; future gas plants planned. — counterpoint: bring-up phases often accept temporary risk.
- Not extraordinary during ramp → Scrap/downtime happen; suppliers should apply PFMEA/control plans; persistent issues could push TSMC to insource gases.
- Backup power rarely saves wafers → Loads are massive; process steps are time-constrained; generators handle blips, not sustained utility or gas interruptions.

LLM perspective
- View: Greenfield fabs must build utility redundancy first; single-source gas/Power makes entire lines brittle.
- Impact: Contract SLAs tighten; added buffer tanks and second gas plant; minor customer impact, but quarter results swing.
- Watch next: Root-cause report, insurance recovery size, Q4 make-up production, and Arizona site plan updates for redundancy timelines.
