# Ask HN: Hearing aid wearers, what's hot?

- TL;DR
  - Thread highlights what’s actually working: newer premium aids (Oticon Intent; Phonak Audéo Sphere Infinio I90) bring better spatial cues and ML noise reduction, plus dedicated music modes. But the biggest gains often come from add‑ons: live-caption glasses (e.g., Captify), Zoom/iOS captions, or FM mics for noisy venues. Some prefer active‑ambient IEMs for fidelity, though they’re impractical daily. Pain points remain: hearing-in-noise, Bluetooth mic routing (workarounds on iOS; Android uneven), and privacy/diarization questions around captioning apps.

- Comment pulse
  - Live captions boost comprehension → glasses (Captify), Zoom, and iPhone captions help in meetings; users ask about diarization and account/privacy.
  - Modern aids improve spatial focus → Oticon Intent praised for 3‑mic/IMU directionality and ML noise reduction; music mode restores full bandwidth.
  - Hearing-in-noise remains hardest → FM mics or directional arrays help; compression reduces dynamic range — counterpoint: some report Phonak AI mode excels in crowds.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Pair aids with speech-to-text and FM mics; treat hearing-in-noise as a systems problem, not one gadget.
  - Impact: Winners: vendors enabling on-device diarization, customizable lexicons, and mic routing; losers: closed apps demanding accounts for basic functionality.
  - Watch next: Auracast rollout, iOS/Android mic selection parity, battery/comfort gains, and consumer IEMs with safe transparency tuned for mild losses.
