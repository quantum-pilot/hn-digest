# We stopped roadmap work for a week and fixed bugs

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46029772) | Link: https://lalitm.com/fixits-are-good-for-the-soul/

- TL;DR
  - An org of ~45 engineers runs quarterly “fixit” weeks: pause roadmap, ship only small user-facing and dev-productivity fixes under a strict 2-day limit. They pre-triage bugs (1/2/4 points), use a leaderboard without performance ties, and lean on AI to reduce context-switching. Latest run: 40 participants closed 189 bugs (median 4, max 12), delivering polish, momentum, and compounding workflow gains. Critics worry about lost roadmap time and neglect; author argues polish’s value and suggests smaller formats for smaller teams. HN discussion was minimal/moved.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat fixit weeks as structured papercut sprints; pair with budgeted weekly bug queues to prevent reaccretion.
  - Impact: Expect measurable lifts in activation, retention, and CI latency; senior morale and onboarding speed typically improve.
  - Watch next: Instrument pre/post metrics: time-to-fix, bug reopen rate, friction reports; publish playbook and rotate ownership to sustain cadence.
