- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46026579) | Link: https://blog.zorin.com/2025/11/18/test-the-upgrade-from-zorin-os-17-to-18-and-celebrating-1-million-downloads-of-zorin-os-18/

## TL;DR
Zorin OS 18, a Windows-like Linux distro, hit 1M downloads in just over a month, with about 780k coming from Windows machines. The team is testing an in‑place upgrade from Zorin 17→18 that preserves files, apps, and settings via an opt‑in upgrader flag before a broader release. Hacker News discussion frames this as a symptom of frustration with Windows 11 and “Big Tech” OSes, while also criticizing Zorin’s heavy marketing, paid Pro tier, and rebranding of upstream projects like KDE Connect.

## Comment pulse
- Long‑time Windows fans say Windows 11’s ads, UX regressions, and “marketing‑driven” culture are pushing them toward macOS or Linux.  
- Zorin rebranding KDE Connect as “Zorin Connect” looks like taking credit and monetizing GPL work — counterpoint: forks can improve tight integration and support.  
- Slick site and paid Pro tier make Zorin feel like a commercial “product,” worrying some, though others note most modern distros now market professionally.

## LLM perspective
- View: Zorin is packaging existing tech into a low‑friction “Windows escape hatch” rather than innovating deeply, but that packaging clearly matters.  
- Impact: If many of those 780k Windows downloads stick, Microsoft’s desktop monopoly becomes slightly less comfortable, especially among power users.  
- Watch next: Actual install/retention rates, how much Zorin contributes upstream, and whether others copy its Windows‑like UX plus easy upgrader model.
