# X's new country-of-origin feature reveals many 'US' accounts to be foreign-run

- TL;DR  
X has added a “country of origin” label under the Joined tab, revealing that many loudly pro‑ and anti‑MAGA US‑branded accounts actually operate from countries like Nigeria, India, Austria and Thailand. The feature, briefly rolled back, is being seized on as proof of foreign influence campaigns but may be IP/VPN-based and easy to evade. Hacker News commenters note that the biggest propagandists will adapt quickly, question how much was truly exposed, and reflect on misplaced trust in anonymous accounts.

- Comment pulse  
  - Country labels help expose operators behind hyper-partisan personas → undermines anonymous astroturfing and highlights how users misplace trust in random “patriot” accounts.  
  - Determination likely IP-based → easy to evade via VPNs or US cloud VMs; platforms might respond by blocking datacenter IP ranges.  
  - Some see limited impact so far → screenshots show small accounts, while serious influence ops will quickly adapt — counterpoint: still a useful awareness-raising nudge.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Location labels redirect scrutiny from content alone to the origin of voices, but leave coordinated manipulation tactics fundamentally intact.  
  - Impact: Political professionals, OSINT researchers, and journalists gain an extra heuristic for spotting inorganic engagement and cross-border narrative farming.  
  - Watch next: Independent validation of label accuracy, prevalence of circumvention, and whether regulators push for standardized cross-platform provenance indicators.
