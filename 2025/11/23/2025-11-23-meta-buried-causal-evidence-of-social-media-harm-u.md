# Meta buried 'causal' evidence of social media harm, US court filings allege

- Score: 612 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46019817) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-buried-causal-evidence-social-media-harm-us-court-filings-allege-2025-11-23/

### TL;DR
Unsealed court filings in a lawsuit by U.S. school districts allege Meta shut down an internal 2020 “Project Mercury” study, conducted with Nielsen, after it found that deactivating Facebook/Instagram for a week *caused* reductions in depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison. Plaintiffs say Meta then told Congress it couldn’t quantify harm, while internally designing youth safety features to be weak and tolerating egregious thresholds for sex‑trafficking and predator accounts. Meta denies wrongdoing, calling the study flawed and the filings cherry‑picked. HN discussion centers on scams, elder/teen harm, and the need for regulation and healthier communication tools.

### Comment pulse
- Meta platforms enable mass scams, especially targeting elders → families report devastating financial and emotional damage; demand strict liability for scam ads and fraudulent accounts.  
- Meta is akin to tobacco/oil in hiding harm → engagement‑driven, ad‑funded models degrade mental health and civic life; regulation and even “corporate death penalties” are floated — counterpoint: some urge caution about plaintiffs’ spin on internal thresholds.  
- Simply quitting isn’t enough → technologists should build non-addictive, utility-first, possibly non‑corporate or non‑US communication systems; client-side tools to block dark patterns may help but can themselves be exploited.

### LLM perspective
- View: This case crystallizes a shift from “correlation” debates to alleged *internal causal* evidence of harm plus conscious suppression.  
- Impact: In-house research, safety teams, and corporate communications at ad-driven platforms will face heavier legal scrutiny and discovery risk.  
- Watch next: Whether the court unseals Meta’s documents; legislative moves on youth/elder online protections; experiments with non-engagement business models.
