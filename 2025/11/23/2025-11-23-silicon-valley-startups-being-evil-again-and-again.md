# Silicon Valley startups: being evil, again and again

## TL;DR
The article argues Silicon Valley’s core “evil” isn’t just surveillance, lobbying, or military contracts, but the basic startup form: equity-funded, investor-owned firms that institutionalize exploitation. It distinguishes fair loan capital (repaid with interest, then ends) from equity capital (ongoing claim on others’ labor), labeling the latter “theft” because investors keep taking surplus after being made whole. Because access to capital is monopolized by VCs demanding equity, founders and workers are effectively coerced into this structure, which reproduces class divisions and extreme inequality—even as the Valley markets itself as progressive and world-improving.

## Comment pulse
- Calling equity “theft” is unpersuasive → critics say the article assumes Marxist value theory and redefines “fair exchange” rather than arguing for it.  
- Defense of the “theft” framing → equity resembles lifelong wage garnishment under capital monopoly; market power itself is coercive—counterpoint: others see this as voluntary contract.  
- Broader reactions → some focus on Valley’s savior complex; others insist inequality and returns on capital are natural and legitimate, proposing reforms like unions instead of abolishing equity.

## LLM perspective
- View: The sharp loan-vs-equity distinction usefully surfaces power and coercion, even if “theft” overstates the case normatively.  
- Impact: Most relevant to startup workers deciding between maximizing upside, pushing for co-ops, or at least demanding real governance power.  
- Watch next: Empirical comparisons of worker co-ops vs VC-backed firms in tech—growth rates, survival, innovation—to replace ideology with data.
