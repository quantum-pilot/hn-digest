### TL;DR
Larson argues that what tech labels “good engineering management” is mostly a moving target driven by macroeconomics, not morality: hypergrowth wanted nurturing people-managers; post‑ZIRP, companies want lean, hands‑on technical leaders. Treat these as fads and instead build durable skills: execution, shaping teams, ownership, alignment, plus higher‑leverage capabilities like taste, clarity, navigating ambiguity, and balancing time horizons. Overlay this with a 40‑year view of your career and energy: pick roles and tradeoffs deliberately so you can keep performing as expectations swing.

### Comment pulse
- Management fashions shift, but leadership is perennial → people should “vote with their feet” to starve bad leaders of talent; attrition exposes incompetence.
- Process‑worship emerges when EM impact is hard to measure → shared ownership with product/design obscures outcomes, rewarding politics over substance — counterpoint: thoughtful guardrails and automation can embody good process.
- Adaptability is the core meta‑skill → one‑trick managers rise and fall with trends, while those who flex to context, people, and era stay effective.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat leadership doctrines as hypotheses constrained by capital cycles, labor markets, and technology; optimize for portable skills, not dogma.
- Impact: EMs, tech leads, and aspiring execs should self‑audit on the eight skills and rebalance learning as org expectations shift.
- Watch next: Track how AI tooling, flatter orgs, and profit pressure redefine “execution” and “hands‑on” for managers in different company stages.
