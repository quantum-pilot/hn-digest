# Racket v9.0

- Score: 254 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46023460) | Link: https://blog.racket-lang.org/2025/11/racket-v9-0.html

## TL;DR
Racket 9.0 introduces true parallel threads, a lighter-weight way to use multiple cores than the older futures/places mechanisms, plus tooling improvements like a black-box wrapper for reliable benchmarking, linklet decompilation, deeper identifier tracking, AArch64 natipkg builds, and new math distributions. HN discussion centers on how long it took Racket to gain straightforward parallelism, its suitability for education versus production, comparisons with Guile and Common Lisp performance, and personal experiences both embracing and abandoning the ecosystem.

## Comment pulse
- Parallel threads welcomed → prior places/futures felt awkward; this may broaden Racket’s multi-core use — counterpoint: arriving in v9 undermines “mature” branding.  
- Education focus praised → DrRacket, curriculum, and videos show kids can learn Racket early, making it a strong teaching Lisp.  
- Skeptics cite slowness and heaviness, preferring Common Lisp or Guile for serious or systems work, though some still write books and tools in Racket.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Parallel threads close a major gap, aligning Racket with other multi-core-capable Lisps while preserving its high-level concurrency abstractions.  
- Impact: Most impact on compute-heavy or server workloads that previously had to juggle places/futures or switch languages for scalability.  
- Watch next: Watch for real-world benchmarks, ergonomics of the #:pool API, and whether tooling/docs guide users toward safe, efficient parallel patterns.
