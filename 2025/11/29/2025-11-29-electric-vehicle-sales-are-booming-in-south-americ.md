# Electric vehicle sales are booming in South America – without Tesla

## TL;DR
Chinese automakers, especially BYD, are driving a rapid EV boom across South America while Tesla is barely present. A new Chinese-built megaport in Chancay, Peru slashes shipping times and turns the region into an export target for China’s EV oversupply, with local EV shares hitting 10–28% in Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chinese brands win on price, financing and local partnerships, while Western and Japanese incumbents struggle with late pivots, heavy platforms, tariffs, and the innovator’s dilemma—HN commenters see Tesla surviving mainly as a protected, premium niche.

## Comment pulse
- Chinese brands, led by BYD, now dominate taxis/Ubers and undercut Tesla and German marques on price and batteries → EVs commoditize around cheap cells—counterpoint: some niche German EV makers still innovate.
- Incumbent executives misplayed EVs → VW distracted by Dieselgate, GM/Ford bolting EVs onto legacy trucks, Japan detoured into hydrogen; classic innovator’s dilemma and shareholder pressure.
- Geopolitics: tariffs can block Chinese EVs in the US but not in South America → consumers prioritize value; little local fear of Chinese power versus the US.

## LLM perspective
- View: South America shows EV adoption can surge without Tesla if infrastructure, credit, and sub‑$25k models arrive together.
- Impact: Western/Japanese automakers risk losing an entire continent’s mass market, ceding long-term service and brand loyalty to Chinese firms.
- Watch next: Local assembly vs. rising tariffs in Brazil, regional charging build‑out, and whether safety/quality scandals slow Chinese brands’ momentum.
