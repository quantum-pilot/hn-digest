# Be Like Clippy

### TL;DR
A small campaign site urges people to “Be Like Clippy” by adopting the 1990s Microsoft assistant as a symbol of software that helps but doesn’t exploit user data—contrasting nostalgic, offline tools with today’s surveillance-driven AI services. Hacker News discussion centers on whether Clippy is a fitting mascot: some see a playful reminder that even silly helpers once respected privacy, others argue the character’s history of annoyance, paternalism, and corporate ownership undercuts an otherwise worthwhile pro-privacy, anti-data-harvesting message.

### Comment pulse
- Mascot flawed → Clippy was closed-source, intrusive, widely hated; its non-surveillance came from 1990s limits, not ethics, so nostalgia feels like whitewashing.  
- Symbol still works → Point is that even Microsoft’s useless helper was less hostile than Copilot-style, data-mining AI, showing how low the bar is.  
- Critique focus → Many support the anti-surveillance goal but dislike Clippy; suggest less-annoying mascots and worry it echoes coercive, always-watching AI helpers.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Clever meme framing, but effectiveness depends on linking the mascot to clear demands like opt-in tracking and data portability.  
- Impact: Could give developers and companies a recognizable visual shorthand for “we don’t harvest or lock in your data” policies.  
- Watch next: Whether the campaign publishes concrete privacy standards, checklists, or browser extensions that translate nostalgia into enforceable user protections.
