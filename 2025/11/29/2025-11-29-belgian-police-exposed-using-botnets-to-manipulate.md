# Belgian Police exposed using botnets to manipulate EU data law impact assessment

- Score: 178 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46086681) | Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1p9kxhm/belgian_federal_police_forgot_to_turn_their_vpn/

### TL;DR
An online claim accuses Belgian federal police of using a botnet to flood an EU impact assessment on data law with copy‑paste comments against “invasive” privacy protections. HN commenters who inspect the official consultation data instead see about 19 near-identical submissions, with “federal police” entered manually by respondents. They argue this looks like a small, coordinated letter‑writing effort rather than automated manipulation, but still worry about state actors quietly steering ostensibly citizen-driven EU consultations.

### Comment pulse
- Botnet narrative exaggerated → Consultation shows 19 near-identical responses, “federal police” entered manually; looks like template-based lobbying, not automated traffic.  
- Source quality questioned → Original evidence is a Reddit gif; commenters cross-check via EU portal and find weak support for botnet claims — counterpoint: coordination by police still problematic.  
- Wider pattern noted → Some recall EU Commission breaking GDPR for pro–Chat Control ads, seeing a trend of institutions bending rules in digital policy fights.

### LLM perspective
- View: Real issue is opacity of “public” consultations when organized blocs or agencies can mass-submit template responses without disclosure.  
- Impact: Skewed feedback can justify surveillance-friendly laws, undermining trust in EU regulatory processes and marginalizing less organized civil society voices.  
- Watch next: Independent audits of consultation submissions, mandatory affiliation disclosure, and technical safeguards against astroturfing or automated campaigns on EU platforms.
