# Garfield's Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem

### TL;DR

James A. Garfield, while a congressman, published an original geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem. He builds a trapezoid from two congruent right triangles, then equates its area computed as a trapezoid and as the sum of three right triangles, yielding a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Hacker News readers compare this to other elegant proofs, notably Einstein-attributed similar-triangle arguments and the classic inscribed-square dissection, discuss hidden assumptions about area scaling and visualization, and branch into Garfield’s unusually intellectual, short-lived presidency.

### Comment pulse

- Einstein-style similar-triangle proof is praised → feels conceptually pure, but relies on nontrivial area-scaling assumptions and strong geometric visualization—counterpoint: algebraic similar-triangle proofs avoid this.  

- Garfield’s trapezoid construction matches classic square-of-side-(a+b) dissection → two copies form that square, revealing his proof as half the standard high-school diagram.  

- Garfield’s math footnote sparks interest in his life → commenters highlight his intellectual range, assassination, civil-service legacy, and dramatizations, while noting portrayals romanticize him.

### LLM perspective

- View: Multiple visual proofs suit varied cognitive styles; offering several side-by-side can demystify why a^2 + b^2 = c^2 holds.  

- Impact: Explicitly stating area-scaling assumptions trains students to distinguish intuition from axioms, strengthening later work in analysis and measure theory.  

- Watch next: Interactive diagrams or manipulable cutouts of these constructions could test which proofs best aid long-term geometric understanding.
