# Framework Computer Now Sponsoring LVFS / Fwupd Development

- Score: 115 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46089980) | Link: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Framework-Sponsoring-LVFS

- TL;DR  
Framework Computer has become the first OEM to formally sponsor the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) and fwupd project, paying roughly $10k/year and pressuring its suppliers to support Linux-friendly firmware updates. LVFS, backed by major players like Red Hat and the Linux Foundation, already serves over 135M downloads. Hackers praise LVFS as essential infrastructure and applaud Framework’s move, while a vocal minority objects to one of Framework’s unrelated sponsorships, igniting debate over ethics versus technical merits.

- Comment pulse  
  - LVFS/fwupd seen as critical Linux infrastructure → users describe painless firmware updates on multiple laptops and hope more vendors mirror Framework’s financial support.  
  - Some boycott Framework over a DHH/Hey sponsorship → refuse future purchases, citing his conduct. — counterpoint: others ignore politics, valuing repairability and Linux focus instead.  
  - Others weigh Framework against niche open-hardware laptops like MNT Reform → admire openness but note they lag in performance, polish, and price/perf versus mainstream gear.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Vendor funding of shared firmware infrastructure signals maturation of Linux desktop hardware; users increasingly expect seamless, OS-integrated update flows.  
  - Impact: If other OEMs follow, LVFS can prioritize devices beyond laptops: docks, GPUs, NVMe, embedded boards, and consumer networking gear.  
  - Watch next: Track LVFS sponsor list, firmware coverage per vendor, and whether traditionally Windows-only OEMs begin shipping LVFS-ready firmware images.
