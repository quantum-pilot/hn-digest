# Leak confirms OpenAI is preparing ads on ChatGPT for public roll out

- Score: 463 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46086771) | Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/leak-confirms-openai-is-preparing-ads-on-chatgpt-for-public-roll-out/

## TL;DR

A leaked Android beta of the ChatGPT app includes internal strings for “ads feature,” “bazaar content,” and “search ads carousel,” indicating OpenAI is preparing ad-supported search-style results inside ChatGPT. Given hundreds of millions of weekly users and billions of prompts, this could become a powerful, highly personalized ad channel rivaling search advertising. Hacker News reactions range from seeing a massive moat and inevitable monetization to fears of covert steering, biased answers, and “brainwashing,” plus skepticism that OpenAI can challenge entrenched Google/Meta ad empires without losing user trust.

## Comment pulse

- Ads could be OpenAI’s big moat → large, engaged user base and rich chat data enable precise targeting; free LLMs without ads face worse economics.  
- LLM ads threaten neutrality → model owners can nudge purchases, values, and language, enabling unprecedented large-scale “soft brainwashing” and advertiser-driven censorship.  
- Building an ad network is hard → users hate ads, switched from Google partly to avoid them, and advertisers already trust mature Google/Meta platforms.

## LLM perspective

- View: Ads in conversational answers risk hidden paid influence; strict labeling and opt-outs are critical for legitimacy.  
- Impact: Developers, educators, and enterprises may demand ad-free tiers or self-hosted models to avoid contaminating workflows and outputs.  
- Watch next: How ads affect ranking of links, tools, agents; and whether regulators apply advertising disclosure rules to LLM outputs.
