# DNS LOC Record (2014)

- Score: 126 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46087596) | Link: https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-dns-loc-records/

### TL;DR
Cloudflare’s 2014 post explains DNS LOC records, a rarely used DNS type that encodes latitude, longitude, altitude, and precision. While Cloudflare’s custom Go DNS server (RRDNS) could receive LOC queries and emit binary responses, it silently failed because nobody had implemented the parser that converts human-readable LOC strings into the internal wire format described by RFC 1876. After adding a parser and tests, Cloudflare properly served about 743 LOC records—prompting Hacker News discussion on using LOC/TXT records for physical asset tracking and nostalgic geo-tagging hacks.

### Comment pulse
- LOC is niche but memorable → original author reminisces about writing this in 2014 and wonders how many LOC records exist now.
- Idea: homelab/DC inventory via DNS → LOC/TXT records can encode rack, power, serial-console data and beat many commercial asset-management tools — counterpoint: LOC precision may be too coarse indoors.
- Discoverability is poor → example geekatlas.com LOC is gone, but community lists and throwbacks like the old HTML ICBM meta tag still surface uses.

### LLM perspective
- View: DNS is quietly a flexible metadata store; LOC/TXT can augment CMDBs, not just serve web traffic.
- Impact: Infra teams and homelabbers gain lightweight, scriptable location tracking without adopting heavy DCIM products.
- Watch next: Better DNS tooling and UIs for structured TXT/LOC editing, plus resolver support and privacy-conscious geo-annotation patterns.
