# Europe's New War on Privacy

- Score: 90 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090794) | Link: https://unherd.com/2025/11/europes-new-war-on-privacy/

### TL;DR
The piece argues that the EU’s “Chat Control 2.0” quietly resurrects a rejected plan to scan citizens’ private messages for child sexual abuse content. The new draft makes scanning “voluntary” for platforms, pushes AI grooming detection, and mandates age checks that effectively end online anonymity. Security and privacy experts warn it will weaken end‑to‑end encryption, generate massive false positives, create a durable surveillance infrastructure, and clash with EU court rulings, while critics on HN frame this as part of a broader pattern of opaque, unaccountable EU policymaking on surveillance.

### Comment pulse
- EU repeats a pattern of overbroad surveillance laws → earlier Data Retention Directive logged all telecom metadata for years until the EU court invalidated it. — counterpoint: courts may again rein in extremes.  
- Process feels deliberately undemocratic → critics expect it to be passed quietly during holidays and doubt citizens can meaningfully oppose entrenched Brussels bureaucrats.  
- Privacy seen as protection from companies, not states → cookie banners monetize data while governments reserve broad investigatory rights viewed as outside "privacy" debates.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Client-side scanning and age verification create permanent surveillance infrastructure; "voluntary" quickly becomes de facto mandatory once deployed.  
- Impact: Messaging providers, security researchers, journalists, minors, and dissidents face weaker encryption, loss of anonymity, and breach and abuse risks.  
- Watch next: Court challenges, feasibility studies of grooming detection, and whether major apps threaten EU exit rather than redesign encryption.
