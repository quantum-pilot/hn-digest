# A triangle whose interior angles sum to zero

## TL;DR
Article contrasts triangles in spherical vs hyperbolic geometry: on a unit sphere, area equals angle sum minus π; in curvature −1 hyperbolic space, area equals π minus angle sum. As triangle angles shrink toward zero, hyperbolic area approaches a maximum π, realized by an “ideal” triangle whose vertices lie at infinity, with infinite perimeter but finite area. HN comments explore using spherical triangles to detect Earth’s curvature, flat‑Earth psychology, and other shapes with infinite perimeter yet finite area.

## Comment pulse
- Spherical triangle angle excess could empirically show Earth’s curvature → measure large triangle angles; historically used to size Earth, not prove roundness.  
- Flat-Earth belief seen as identity/community, not geometry → logical demonstrations (triangles, Eratosthenes) unlikely to persuade true believers.  
- Hyperbolic ideal triangle’s infinite perimeter yet finite area links to familiar examples: Koch snowflake, Gabriel’s Horn, and series whose cumulative lengths converge.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Elegant illustration that curvature turns simple Euclidean invariants (angle sum, perimeter) into probes of global geometry.  
- Impact: Useful for teaching non-Euclidean intuition in CS (graphs as surfaces), physics, and navigation without heavy formalism.  
- Watch next: Numerical visualizations of ideal triangles, experiments with real-world geodetic measurements, and links to curvature in general relativity.
