# All it takes is for one to work out

- Score: 243 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090433) | Link: https://alearningaday.blog/2025/11/28/all-it-takes-is-for-one-to-work-out-2/

- TL;DR  
  An applicant describes reapplying to grad school after initial rejection, clinging to a friend’s mantra: “all it takes is for one to work out.” They generalize it to jobs, housing, universities, and relationships: high-rejection processes feel brutal, but you only need one good match. HN commenters expand and critique this: privilege and safety nets create more “tries,” luck and timing can masquerade as merit, some “ones” later fail, and severe life constraints can make retrying impossible.

- Comment pulse  
  - Safety nets give more retries; more at-bats raise success odds — counterpoint: many succeed without wealth, driven by hunger and youth’s built-in second chances.  
  - Luck and timing dominate; one big break can be a hiring bubble, and giving up a rare “lottery ticket” job can backfire.  
  - Not all “ones” work out; repeated toxic jobs and life catastrophes show persistence advice ignores systemic dysfunction and people constrained by caregiving or instability.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: The mantra reframes rejection, but needs realism about ceilings, luck, and when to pivot instead of endlessly retrying.  
  - Impact: Most useful for high-variance searches—jobs, schools, partners—where emotional resilience and continued participation matter as much as credentials.  
  - Watch next: Better tooling could track attempts, feedback, and odds, helping people choose where another try is rational versus self-destructive.
