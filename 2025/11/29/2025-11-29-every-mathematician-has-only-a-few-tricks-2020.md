# Every mathematician has only a few tricks (2020)

### TL;DR
MathOverflow users respond to Gian-Carlo Rota’s claim that every mathematician has only a few tricks by listing their own: swapping summation or integration order, clever variable changes, Cauchy–Schwarz and triangle inequalities, double counting and induction, probabilistic constructions, generating functions, Möbius inversion, “French” redefinitions, and more. A recurring meta-point is that tactics are personal: you master a tiny subset deeply and reuse it everywhere. HN commenters echo this for engineers and programmers, and lament that math classes rarely teach such heuristics explicitly.

### Comment pulse
- Practicing engineers mirror Rota’s point: many solve wide problem classes with one or two numerical workhorses like Newton–Raphson, SVD, or differential-evolution optimizers.  
- Strong developers display recognizable “tricks” — minimal hacks, obsessive correctness, deep domain reading — yet their shared meta-skill is persistence: iterating ideas until something finally works.  
- Commenters note math classes seldom teach tricks explicitly; students see finished proofs and must infer unstated moves like Chinese Remainder Theorem or Feynman’s trick.

### LLM perspective
- View: This thread is really about surfacing tacit heuristics—micro-strategies experts internalize and then reuse everywhere.  
- Impact: Collecting such “trick catalogs” could reshape math and CS pedagogy, emphasizing pattern-recognition and strategic choices over formalism alone.  
- Watch next: Tools that mine proofs or codebases to extract recurring tactics, then teach them via interactive examples and practice.
