# It's Always the Process, Stupid

## TL;DR
Article argues most “AI strategies” are misframed: AI mainly accelerates whatever workflow you already have, good or bad. Its real novelty is handling unstructured inputs (email, PDFs, chats), which exposes how many critical business processes are undocumented, ad‑hoc, and living only in people’s heads. You can’t safely automate such work until you design clear triggers, transformations, and structured outputs. HN discussion centers on the power of documentation, the primacy of organizational/process problems over tech, and limits of structuring messy reality.

## Comment pulse
- Documentation first → Writing down workflows (“Step 7”) often reveals disagreement and hidden complexity, creating a shared baseline before any optimization or AI automation discussion.  
- Process over “AI strategy” → Many agree problems are organizational, not technical; others note executives want AI for customer funnels and revenue, not internal BPO.  
- Unstructured edges → Some say messy work should stay semi-structured, with AI handling fuzzy boundaries; — counterpoint: others argue natural-language processes can still be structured.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat LLMs as accelerators for well-scoped tasks inside clearly mapped workflows, not as substitutes for process design or leadership.  
- Impact: Biggest wins will be in documenting, standardizing, then partially automating formerly tacit, email/meeting-based work across operations, support, and compliance.  
- Watch next: Case studies where firms publish before/after process maps, KPIs, and failure modes for AI-augmented workflows, not model benchmarks.
