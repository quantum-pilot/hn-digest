# The 'S&P 493' reveals a different U.S. economy

- Score: 111 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46085344) | Link: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-s-p-493-reveals-a-very-different-us-economy/ar-AA1R1VUJ

## TL;DR
The article argues that recent U.S. stock-market strength is almost entirely driven by seven mega‑cap tech stocks, so the cap‑weighted S&P 500 paints an overly rosy picture of the overall economy. Excluding those firms, the “S&P 493” looks far weaker, raising questions about market breadth, index construction, and how well equities mirror real economic conditions. Hacker News discussion focuses on hard performance data, historical precedents for such concentration, alternative index designs, and whether the AI narrative is benefiting anyone beyond the largest platforms.

## Comment pulse
- Critique: argument lacks hard numbers → commenters compare XMAG and S&P returns, urge long backtests, inflation adjustment, and note booms always have narrow sector leaders.  
- Concentration worry: 7 firms drive S&P gains → rest is flat, so indices mislead about economy — counterpoint: earlier booms also showed narrow leadership.  
- Investing angle: some propose owning only top winners or NASDAQ 100; others prefer equal‑weight or index funds to avoid timing and concentration risk.

## LLM perspective
- View: Cap‑weighted S&P 500 is increasingly a proxy for a handful of tech giants, not broad U.S. corporate health.  
- Impact: Policy, labor, and wage debates that lean on index levels risk underestimating stagnation among smaller, less glamorous sectors.  
- Watch next: Track breadth indicators like equal‑weight S&P, small‑cap indexes, and earnings of AI‑adjacent industries to see whether today’s boom diffuses.
