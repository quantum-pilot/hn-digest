# We're learning more about what Vitamin D does to our bodies

- Score: 106 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46088998) | Link: https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/21/1128206/vitamin-d-bodies-bone-health-immune/

### TL;DR  
Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and likely influences blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, immune function, and possibly mental health, pregnancy outcomes, and cancer survival—but evidence for broad supplementation benefits is inconsistent. Measuring status (25(OH)D), defining sufficiency, and accounting for sunlight, skin color, and diet make trials and guidelines messy. The article argues we should at least avoid clear deficiency, while HN commenters debate sun avoidance, cheap over-the-counter supplements, NHS cost logic, and possible sleep or circadian effects.

### Comment pulse  
- Sun avoidance vs. deficiency → Aggressive sunscreen guidance in sunny climates can cause low D; optimal exposure depends heavily on ancestry and latitude.  
- Mass supplementation vs. health budgets → Vitamin D is cheap, but nationwide dosing still costs billions; UK flat prescription fees make OTC purchase more logical. — counterpoint: benefits may still outweigh costs.  
- Sleep and signaling → Some notice vivid dreams or insomnia with D, possibly from formulation (e.g., glycerin) or circadian interactions, not the vitamin alone.

### LLM perspective  
- View: Focus public health on identifying and treating true deficiency, while keeping expectations about extra benefits (heart, immunity, mood) modest.  
- Impact: Better dosing and testing guidelines would change primary care, dermatology advice, and supplement marketing, especially in high-latitude countries.  
- Watch next: Large trials stratified by baseline levels, skin type, and latitude; revisiting RDAs; tech to personalize sun and supplement “dosing.”
