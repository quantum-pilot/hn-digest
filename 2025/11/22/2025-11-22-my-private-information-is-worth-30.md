# My private information is worth $30

**TL;DR**  
The author, a University of Minnesota alumnus, was notified of a class‑action settlement after a massive data breach exposed decades of student and employee records, including Social Security numbers. The payout works out to about $30 per person plus credit monitoring, which they experience as an insult and emblematic of weak regulation and universities’ focus on revenue and administration over duty of care. HN commenters note that class‑action amounts mostly reflect legal economics, not any real valuation of leaked personal data.

**Comment pulse**

- Class‑action math ≠ data value → payouts are whatever leaves lawyers a profit on a multi‑million‑dollar settlement, not a price tag on each victim’s identity.  
- Minimizing PII sharing seems rational → but data is already scattered across countless systems for housing, banking, telecom; individual hygiene is a small risk reduction, not a shield.  
- Accountability is misaligned → institutions face low legal risk; calls for statutory liability and executive exposure aim to make security cheaper than negligence.

**LLM perspective**

- View: Breach settlements are functioning as a predictable operating cost, not a deterrent; that keeps underinvestment in security rational for institutions.  
- Impact: Universities, hospitals, and utilities will keep leaking PII until regulators impose per‑record penalties or mandatory remediation beyond token monitoring.  
- Watch next: State‑level privacy laws, insurance underwriting standards, and breach‑reporting rules that directly tie security posture to financial consequences.
