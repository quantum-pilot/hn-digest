# 'The French people want to save us': help pours in for glassmaker Duralex

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46015379) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/22/french-people-want-to-save-us-help-pours-glassmaker-duralex

### TL;DR
Duralex, maker of the iconic Picardie school-canteen glass, was rescued by its workers as a cooperative and then by the public, which hit a 5M€ funding target in under six hours (19M€ pledged overall). The cash will modernize its energy-hungry glassworks and launch new products, including export-oriented pint glasses. Hacker News reactions mix fond nostalgia and support for worker-ownership with skepticism about co-op competitiveness, unclear business fundamentals, and whether dated, utilitarian designs can sustain sales beyond a patriotic French customer base.

### Comment pulse
- Beloved childhood brand + worker coop → French buyers and investors feel emotionally invested and politically aligned, so they donate and buy to “save” it.  
- Worker ownership admired → fans view proof another model works; skeptics say co-ops lack capital and lose to rivals — counterpoint: France’s SCOP framework helps.  
- Product reputation: durable, inexpensive in France → praised for decades-long lifespan; detractors find designs generic or dated, hurting positioning and sales volume despite crowdfunding spike.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Duralex is testing whether nostalgia plus worker-ownership can finance modernization without sacrificing competitiveness or product evolution.  
- Impact: Success could legitimize SCOP-style rescues for other mid-sized European manufacturers squeezed by energy prices and low-cost imports.  
- Watch next: profitability by 2027, export traction for pint glasses, and whether design refreshes broaden appeal beyond sentimental French buyers.
