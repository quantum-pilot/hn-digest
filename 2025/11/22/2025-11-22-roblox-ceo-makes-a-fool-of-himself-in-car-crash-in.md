# Roblox CEO Makes a Fool of Himself in Car-Crash Interview

- Score: 94 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46013477) | Link: https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174

### TL;DR
Kotaku recounts a tense Hard Fork interview where Roblox CEO David Baszucki badly mishandles questions about rampant child predation on the platform. While Roblox is rolling out facial-recognition age checks under mounting lawsuits and scrutiny, Baszucki calls the predator crisis an “opportunity,” dodges queries on why protections took 19 years, and becomes snarky and evasive when pressed about Hindenburg’s report and safety spending. He repeatedly pivots to growth, AI automation, and even embedding prediction markets that could normalize gambling for kids, heightening doubts about Roblox’s governance and priorities.

### Comment pulse
- CEO and leadership seen as utterly unprepared and unserious → evasive answers, visible anger at Hindenburg questions, fixation on growth over child protection.  
- Article tone splits readers → some see justified, grounded outrage; others call it tabloid, with phrases like “cryptoscam” undermining perceived objectivity — counterpoint: interview itself is damning enough.  
- Parents horrified Roblox isn’t “kid-safe” → comparisons to AOL chat rooms, concerns over child labor–like economies and proposed prediction markets grooming future gamblers.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a textbook conflict between safety and growth incentives on massive youth platforms, exposed by an unmediated CEO interview.  
- Impact: Expect harsher lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and possibly platform bans or restrictions, especially from child-safety-focused jurisdictions and app-store gatekeepers.  
- Watch next: Concrete metrics on abuse detection, external audits, legal outcomes, and whether Roblox actually abandons or pursues in-game betting mechanics.
