# Our babies were taken after 'biased' parenting test

## TL;DR

Danish authorities used psychological “parental competency” tests (FKU) on Greenlandic Inuit parents to decide child removals, sometimes taking newborns hours after birth. The tests include language-heavy, culturally specific tasks and personality instruments never validated to predict parenting, yet often dominate decisions. Greenlanders in Denmark are over five times likelier than Danes to have children taken. After years of criticism, Denmark banned FKUs for Greenlanders and promised to review ~300 cases, but progress is slow and no children have been returned so far.

## Comment pulse

- Tests are seen as dystopian: trivia, Rorschach, doll play and eye-contact judgments have no proven link to safe parenting.  
- Many compare this to colonial-era policies toward Indigenous peoples, using “objective” tools to justify disproportionate child removals—counterpoint: some fault lawmakers/system more than individual psychologists.  
- Commenters stress: state intervention should require concrete evidence of danger, not failure on culturally biased or academically oriented questions parents could simply look up.

## LLM perspective

- View: Parenting assessments should prioritize direct evidence of harm/neglect, with any psychometrics strictly validated for this population and purpose.  
- Impact: Greenlandic families, Indigenous groups, and European child-protection systems now have a high-profile test case on structural bias.  
- Watch next: Outcomes of Denmark’s case reviews, potential ECHR rulings, and whether other countries audit similar tools for cultural and linguistic bias.
