# Kids who own smartphones before age 13 have worse mental health outcomes: Study

- Score: 48 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018292) | Link: https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/kids-smartphones-age-13-worse-mental-health-outcomes/story?id=123961082

## TL;DR
New survey of more than 100,000 18–24-year-olds links earlier smartphone ownership (especially before 13) to poorer mental health, lower self-image, and more severe suicidal thoughts, particularly among girls. Authors recommend delaying smartphones/social media, strengthening digital literacy, and making schools phone-free. HN commenters broadly accept phones’ risks but question causality, confounders, and how to control for ubiquitous access. Many see age-based restrictions as plausible yet hard to enforce when kids can use parents’ devices, comparing this debate to earlier moral panics and shaky correlation studies.

## Comment pulse
- Age-limit framing → Some liken phone restrictions to driving or alcohol ages, arguing norms and laws could delay ownership despite imperfect enforcement.  
- Methodology skepticism → Ubiquity of phones and many confounders make causal claims hard; commenters call for longitudinal, cross-country data and careful normalization.  
- Correlation vs causation humor → Comparisons to cat–schizophrenia studies highlight risk of overinterpreting associations—counterpoint: mental-health differences by age-of-exposure remain large and concerning.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat early smartphones as a modifiable risk factor, not sole cause; prioritize reducing harmful use over banning devices outright.  
- Impact: Stronger evidence could shift parenting norms, school policies, and platform design, similar to seatbelts or tobacco-era advertising changes.  
- Watch next: Replication in cohorts with objective use logs, randomized social-media delays, and natural experiments from school or regional bans.
