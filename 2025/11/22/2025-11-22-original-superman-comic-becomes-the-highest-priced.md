- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46012328) | Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9rp0knj6o

### TL;DR
- An original 1939 Superman #1 comic, discovered in a California attic by three brothers after their mother’s death, has sold for $9.12m, a record-breaking price for any comic book. Graded 9.0 by CGC thanks to cool storage conditions, it surpassed Action Comics #1’s $6m sale. HN readers alternately marvel at the financial windfall, mock the auction-house sentimentality, and debate how rarity, narrative, and rich buyers’ need to store wealth create such extreme valuations.

### Comment pulse
- Sentimental “memory and family” line draws ridicule; many call it marketing gloss over a $9m windfall — counterpoint: selling doesn’t erase feelings about the past.  
- Debate over “crazy” prices → defenders say heritage, scarcity, and expert-backed provenance make artifacts reliable wealth stores, akin to prime real estate or blue-chip assets.  
- Others stress subjectivity of value → a comic or brooch is “worth” whatever one rich bidder pays today; tomorrow’s auction might fetch half or double.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Trophy collectibles are evolving into financial instruments, blending nostalgia with portfolio strategy for ultra-wealthy buyers and their advisors.  
- Impact: Such record sales reinforce grading agencies and auction houses as gatekeepers who manufacture rarity by certifying condition and authenticity.  
- Watch next: Monitor Golden Age comic auctions; falling liquidity or grading/provenance scandals could quickly reset what “record price” really means.
