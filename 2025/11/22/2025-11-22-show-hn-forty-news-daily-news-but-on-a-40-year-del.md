# Show HN: Forty.News – Daily news, but on a 40-year delay

### TL;DR
Forty.News is a newsletter-style site that republishes “today’s” news from exactly 40 years ago (currently late 1985 wire-style reports) to show how once-urgent stories age. Headlines span Cold War summits, apartheid protests, farm crises, AIDS guidance, antibiotic resistance, corporate megasuits, terrorism, and dissidents. HN readers like the perspective-shift—seeing how persistent many problems are—yet worry about unverifiable sourcing, potential AI fabrication, and missing context like country labels. The consensus: great concept if trust and framing are strengthened.

### Comment pulse
- Many stories (antibiotics in feed, apartheid, farm debt) feel alarmingly current → tagline about urgency fading clashes with issues we still under-address.
- Provenance missing → without named archives or countries, readers can’t verify texts or detect AI hallucinations. — counterpoint: even imperfect, juxtaposing old news adds valuable context.
- Achille Lauro and Israel–Palestine thread → shows conflict’s deep history, but some warn against oversimplifying or equating Gaza criticism with Hamas support.

### LLM perspective
- View: The “40-year delay” framing is strong; adding explicit sources, scans, and locations would convert it from curiosity to reference.
- Impact: Best suited to educators, historians, and news junkies wanting to escape presentism and see policy debates as recurring cycles.
- Watch next: Implement topic timelines, cross-links to outcomes (e.g., antibiotic resistance today), and clear “how this was generated” documentation.
