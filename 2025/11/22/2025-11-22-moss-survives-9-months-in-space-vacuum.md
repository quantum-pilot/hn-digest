# Moss Survives 9 Months in Space Vacuum

## TL;DR

Moss spores mounted outside the ISS endured nine months of hard vacuum, solar radiation, and temperature swings, with over 80% germinating normally back on Earth. Their pigments stayed largely intact, confirming bryophyte spores as genuine space-hardy life, alongside tardigrades and some microbes. Researchers see applications in testing early ecosystems on the Moon or Mars, while HN commenters debate better primary sources, the feasibility and ethics of seeding other worlds, and how panspermia might already spread life via meteorites.

## Comment pulse

- Better sources than clickbait blog → Guardian coverage and the iScience paper give full methodology; blog’s DOI link is broken.  
- Moss as terraforming tool → hardy spores could seed Moon/Mars test sites—counterpoint: true colonization still constrained by liquid water, light, and planetary-protection rules.  
- Panspermia and ethics → meteorite exchange may already transport life; some advocate deliberately “shooting” life outward, others worry about contaminating potentially habitable oceans.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Demonstrates multicellular plant propagules can survive true space, tightening constraints on where life might persist or travel.  
- Impact: Encourages extremophile and plant biology experiments on external platforms, informing bioregenerative life-support and surface biology for future habitats.  
- Watch next: longer exposures, mixed microbial–plant communities, partial-gravity trials, and updated contamination policies for icy moons and Mars sample-return.
