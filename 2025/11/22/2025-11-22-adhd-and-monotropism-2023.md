# ADHD and monotropism (2023)

- Score: 99 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46013960) | Link: https://monotropism.org/adhd/

- TL;DR
    - Monotropism views autism and ADHD as variations of an attention style where mental “tunnels” form around a few interests, leaving little capacity for everything else. The essay argues inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, rigidity, hyperfocus and inertia can all result from differences in how people enter, sustain, and exit these tunnels, shaped by motivation, safety, and novelty-seeking. It suggests current diagnoses capture outward behavior, while monotropism models inner experience. HN readers resonate, while clinicians call the framework oversimplified and biologically thin.

- Comment pulse
    - ADHD feels like hyperfocus, not deficit → commenters report deep absorption in interests, missed flights, half-finished projects, and avoidance of tasks that might trap attention.
    - Clinician view → Norwegian psychiatrist finds monotropism descriptively useful but too simple, emphasizing motivation, sensory filtering differences, and known neurodevelopmental factors like atypical synaptic pruning.
    - Diagnostic skepticism → some compare DSM categories to modern shamanism; others counter that diagnoses now hinge on structured symptoms plus life-harming impact, despite crude treatments.

- LLM perspective
    - View → Treating attention style as dimensional, not binary diagnoses, could better capture overlapping autistic/ADHD traits without multiplying labels.
    - Impact → Could influence classroom, workplace and UX design: fewer forced context switches, more protected focus windows, optional stimulation levels.
    - Watch next → Longitudinal studies linking monotropism scores to outcomes, brain imaging, and medication response across mixed autism/ADHD populations.
