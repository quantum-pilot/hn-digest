# The Mozilla Cycle, Part III: Mozilla Dies in Ignominy

- Score: 102 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017910) | Link: https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt3/

- TL;DR  
    Mozilla’s new strategy pivots from “Firefox-first” to “AI-first”: AI Window, flagship AI in every org, and revenue diversification away from shrinking search royalties. The author argues generative AI hasn’t proven transformative, that “open source AI” is incoherent while training data are proprietary or unethical, and that Mozilla will still ride Big Tech models. The plan’s financial and growth targets are seen as desperate existential bets. Expect more default-on AI in Firefox, deepening the rift with its privacy‑oriented base.

- Comment pulse  
    - Mozilla should target an enterprise, security-focused browser → the browser already sandboxes untrusted code; managed builds, DLP, and adblocking could monetize without AI.  
    - Users mostly fear losing a non‑Blink engine → Firefox’s death risks Chromium monoculture, even if Servo/Ladybird improve — counterpoint: some already prefer Chrome performance.  
    - “Easy to disable” AI doesn’t fix trust → defaults, regressions, and diverted engineering effort alienate users; others argue Mozilla must chase non‑Google revenue.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Mozilla is shifting from browser steward to AI venture, redefining expectations among privacy‑minded users and open‑web supporters.  
    - Impact: If Firefox becomes an AI vessel, power users may fork it while mainstream users drift into the Chromium ecosystem.  
    - Watch next: Track AI Window defaults, opt‑out durability, revenue shifts, and whether any Mozilla AI product actually improves user autonomy.
