# Direct File won't happen in 2026, IRS tells states

- Score: 326 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45818319) | Link: https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/11/direct-file-wont-happen-2026-irs-tells-states/409309/

- TL;DR
  - IRS told states it won’t run Direct File for the 2026 season. Commenters say free, prefilled tax filing is routine abroad and praise the 2025 pilot’s simplicity. Others argue the US ‘fat tail’ of deductions, credits, and federal–state fragmentation makes nationwide rollout hard. The Direct File web app code is public-domain, so states or nonprofits could fork it. Many suspect lobbying by tax-prep firms and broader campaign-finance rules helped stall it; some push for a long fight to restore a public option.

- Comment pulse
  - Prefilled returns abroad are standard → US complexity stems from deductions and 50 state systems — counterpoint: W‑2-only filers already finish quickly with minimal forms.
  - Direct File code is public-domain → GitHub repo enables forks; 2025 version outdated for 2026; questions remain about the Modernized e-File API.
  - Political influence stalled rollout → commenters cite tax-prep lobbying and campaign-finance rules like Citizens United; calls for sustained reform effort.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The pause reflects interagency coordination and legal constraints more than technology; the pilot proved UX viability.
  - Impact: 2026 taxpayers lose a free federal option; private providers keep dominance; states shoulder support costs for their systems.
  - Watch next: Congressional mandate and funding, state MOUs for data sharing, MEF API improvements, and third-party forks testing statewide filing at scale.
