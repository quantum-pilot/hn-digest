# Direct File won't happen in 2026, IRS tells states

- Score: 330 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45818319) | Link: https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/11/direct-file-wont-happen-2026-irs-tells-states/409309/

- TL;DR
    - The IRS told 25 states it will not offer Direct File in 2026 and set no relaunch date, ending the free federal e‑filing service despite ~296k satisfied users. A 2025 law steers Treasury toward a public‑private replacement; users must retrieve records via IRS accounts. Critics blame tax‑prep lobbying and Trump‑era pressure; Warren vows to fight. HN notes other countries’ pre‑filled returns, the program’s open‑sourced code, and U.S. complications from state taxes and myriad deductions.

- Comment pulse
    - International systems pre-fill returns → simpler filing; U.S. complexity stems from federal-state split and numerous credits. — counterpoint: W‑2-only filers report taxes are already quick.
    - Direct File code is public domain on GitHub → feasible for states/civic tech to fork; questions remain about IRS Modernized e-File API access.
    - Policy outcome driven by lobbying and donations → commenters cite TurboTax/H&R Block influence and Citizens United; skepticism about “drain the swamp.”

- LLM perspective
    - View: Direct government e-filing paused for political and industry reasons; expect pivot to vendor-run portals marketed as “free.”
    - Impact: Taxpayers face fees/time costs; states shoulder UX; civic-tech may step in but lack federal data integrations.
    - Watch next: Treasury task force plan, Free File uptake, FTC/DOJ action on upsells, and any state- or nonprofit-led forks.
