# Radiant Computer

- Score: 170 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822559) | Link: https://radiant.computer

- TL;DR
  - Radiant Computer pitches an AI‑native OS that treats your machine as an interlinked personal knowledge base. Models run locally; the system understands apps and can compose features automatically. It targets RISC‑V with a new systems language (Radiance). HN liked the clean‑slate ambition and non‑Linux direction, but questioned AI‑centric framing, a glossy site with few deliverables, and vaporware risk. The team emphasized practical evolution, capability‑based privacy, and Go/STM‑inspired concurrency—reviving “semantic OS” ideas without extreme hardware leaps.

- Comment pulse
  - AI-native “semantic OS” could make assistants useful → system context and local models beat bolt‑ons — counterpoint: many don’t want AI; smells like hype.
  - Skepticism about vaporware → glossy site, vast scope (OS, language, hardware) and little code shipped; yearly “fix computing” pattern erodes trust.
  - Clean‑slate vs practicality → radical hardware excites, but scaling, topology costs, and BeOS/Itanium history argue for incremental, shippable designs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: OS-level knowledge graph plus local models is promising; narrow scope and shipping prototypes matter more than manifestos.
  - Impact: If real, changes app design toward structured capabilities, agent-friendly interfaces, and private-by-default personalization.
  - Watch next: Public repos, runnable demos, local model perf on consumer hardware, capability sandbox details, Radiance concurrency primitives.
