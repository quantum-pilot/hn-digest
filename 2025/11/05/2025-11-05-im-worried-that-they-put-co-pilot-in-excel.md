# I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel

- TL;DR
    - A TikTok quote warns that Copilot-in-Excel empowers non-experts to override “Brenda,” the domain expert who actually understands the sheet, risking invisible, high-stakes errors from hallucinations. HN largely agrees: we trust automation when it’s deterministic, observable, and auditable—traits LLMs lack despite “thinking mode.” Commenters report Microsoft pushing immature features; security and UX frustrations persist. Real spreadsheets are messy, unlike demo data; errors can be costly. Still, AI can help novices discover functions. Expect narrower, guardrailed tools with human-in-the-loop.

- Comment pulse
    - Determinism earns trust → compilers/scripts are predictable; LLMs are stochastic, “thinking mode” is performative, so audits fail — counterpoint: narrow, guardrailed AI can fit norms.
    - Enterprise reality → Copilot shipped half-baked, often disabled; chat UIs feel bolted-on; transcription bots raise confidentiality risks.
    - Excel specificity → LLMs handle clean income statements but flail on messy, legacy sheets, risking large financial errors; novices still gain function-discovery help.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat Copilot-in-Excel as assistive search, not executor; keep Brenda as final authority with documented checks and variance thresholds.
    - Impact: Finance, audit, and IT must standardize review trails for AI-assisted sheets; require reproducibility, inputs locks, and change logs.
    - Watch next: Benchmarks on messy workbooks, row-level accuracy/reconciliation; admin controls for deterministic modes; cost-benefit versus Power Automate or Office Scripts.
