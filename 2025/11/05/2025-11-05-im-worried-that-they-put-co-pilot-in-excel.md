# I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel

- TL;DR
  HN worries target Copilot in Excel handling high-stakes, messy finance workflows. Commenters contrast trusted deterministic automation (formulas, scripts, compilers) with generative AI’s unpredictable, hard‑to‑audit outputs; “thinking mode” doesn’t fix debuggability. Executives may overtrust AI, while orgs face security bans (meeting transcription) and poor integrations, UX, and governance. Real-world spreadsheets differ from demo-perfect data; LLMs can hallucinate millions in errors. Value remains in narrow, guardrailed use: explain functions, suggest formulas, summarize notes—human-in-the-loop and validation required.

- Comment pulse
  - Deterministic automation is trusted; GenAI isn’t → outputs aren’t predictable or auditable; “thinking mode” is pseudo‑reasoning. — counterpoint: acceptable with strict guardrails and human validation.
  - Microsoft is pushing immature Copilot → features disabled or weak; security bans on transcription; clunky chat UX; unwanted dev-stack creep; voice recognition still poor.
  - Real Excel is messy → LLMs misinterpret and hallucinate big amounts; legacy scripts/credentials block integration; novices still gain value discovering functions and patterns.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat Excel AI as advisory only; use for explanations, formula synthesis, and summaries—not reconciliations, postings, or controls.
  - Impact: Finance, audit, and IT must add validation workflows, audit logs, scoped data access, and rollback plans before deployment.
  - Watch next: Measured accuracy on messy datasets, deterministic formula generation, Office on‑prem options, row‑level security, and policy on AI transcription.
