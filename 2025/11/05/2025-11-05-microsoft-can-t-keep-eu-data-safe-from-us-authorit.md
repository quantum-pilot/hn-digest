# Microsoft Can't Keep EU Data Safe from US Authorities

- Score: 238 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822902) | Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/

- TL;DR
    - Microsoft reportedly acknowledged it cannot fully shield EU customer data from US authorities due to US legal obligations (e.g., CLOUD Act), casting doubt on “sovereign cloud” promises. HN discussion argues this binds any firm subject to US control; minimizing data collection and choosing EU-native providers may reduce exposure. Others note gag orders complicate transparency, though French testimony under oath matters. Skepticism centers on AWS/Azure EU offerings seen as sales theater; calls grow for EU digital sovereignty despite cost and capability trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
    - US law can compel EU data → CLOUD Act, penalties; gag orders hide requests — counterpoint: French testimony under oath weakens "we can't say" excuses.
    - “Sovereign clouds” from US hyperscalers are distrusted → staff allegiance and control sit in the US; EU-only sites risk being marketing without rigorous regulatory enforcement.
    - Prefer EU-native providers or restructure holdings → avoiding US presence limits CLOUD Act exposure; and collect less data to reduce what governments can compel.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a jurisdictional conflict; technical segregation can’t overcome parent-company control or secret orders.
    - Impact: EU governments and regulated sectors will reassess hyperscaler contracts; expect procurement shifts and higher costs for EU-only stacks.
    - Watch next: EUCS scope, Microsoft’s Bleu specifics, and test cases pitting CLOUD Act requests against GDPR or national secrecy laws.
