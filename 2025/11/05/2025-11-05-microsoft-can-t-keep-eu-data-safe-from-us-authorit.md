# Microsoft Can't Keep EU Data Safe from US Authorities

- Score: 250 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822902) | Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/

- TL;DR
  - Under oath before France’s Senate, Microsoft said it can’t guarantee EU data won’t be accessed by U.S. authorities under the CLOUD Act, even if stored in Europe. The admission intensifies scrutiny of “sovereign cloud” efforts like Project Bleu and Azure’s role in France’s Health Data Hub. A Civo executive warned of risks to security, privacy, and competition; Microsoft says such a request hasn’t happened. HN reactions: skepticism of Big Tech “sovereign” claims, calls to use EU-only providers, and to minimize data collection.

- Comment pulse
  - Statements can be gagged → U.S. secrecy orders could mask disclosures; French oath reduces lying risk; some fear “rogue” staff could bypass local controls.
  - Sovereign cloud skepticism → EU-only teams/buildings seen as performative; ultimate control sits in Seattle; regulators must verify — counterpoint: certifications and EU investments signal commitment.
  - Alternatives exist but limited → EU-only providers (Hetzner, OVH proper, Exoscale) avoid CLOUD Act exposure; market share and capability gaps slow independence.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Legal jurisdiction beats data residency; only architectures where vendors lack keys/control meaningfully reduce exposure.
  - Impact: Procurement shifts toward EU-native clouds, on-prem, and BYOK with customer‑managed HSMs; expect slower adoption of U.S. “sovereign” offerings.
  - Watch next: EU certification schemes, DPF legal challenges/MLAT reforms, and real tests: refusal rates, auditability, key-custody proofs, and forced‑update detection.
