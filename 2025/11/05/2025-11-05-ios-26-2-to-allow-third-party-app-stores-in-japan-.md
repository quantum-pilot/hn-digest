# iOS 26.2 to allow third-party app stores in Japan ahead of regulatory deadline

- Score: 310 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822302) | Link: https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-third-party-app-stores-japan/

- TL;DR
  - Apple plans to enable third-party app stores in Japan before a new competition law takes effect. HN says the change only matters if Apple lowers “distribution friction” (install prompts, deep links, auto‑updates, payments) and grants “runtime parity” (push, background tasks, NFC, entitlements without extra fees). Otherwise it’s EU‑style malicious compliance, possibly enforced via notarization. Skeptics expect Apple to ship at the last moment and do the bare minimum, driven by high‑margin services revenue; viability will be measured by taps from web→install→update.

- Comment pulse
  - Alt stores need low friction + runtime parity → neutral prompts, auto‑updates, payments, full entitlements; else malicious compliance — counterpoint: some niches still benefit.
  - Notarization keeps Apple as gatekeeper → many App Store rules persist; unclear if Japan will curb this, and EU DMA enforcement looks timid.
  - Apple will do the bare minimum before deadlines → fines are cheaper than concessions; “ahead of deadline” phrasing mocked as last‑minute compliance.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Viability hinges on install/update funnel parity and entitlement costs; notarization scope is the swing factor.
  - Impact: If prompts and updates match App Store, expect Epic/Steam-style stores and price pressure on in‑app payments.
  - Watch next: JFTC guidance on prompts/updates, API entitlement fees, NFC access; first Japanese publisher announcing a real store and adoption metrics.
