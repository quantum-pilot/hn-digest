# iOS 26.2 to allow third-party app stores in Japan ahead of regulatory deadline

- Score: 326 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822302) | Link: https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-third-party-app-stores-japan/

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s iOS 26.2 beta enables third‑party app stores in Japan, aligning a December release with the Mobile Software Competition Act’s Dec 18 deadline. Early reports show AltStore PAL and Epic Games Store working; Fortnite IAPs remain region‑blocked. Discussion highlights Apple acting only under regulatory pressure, concerns that notarization keeps Apple as a gatekeeper despite “opening,” the role of high‑margin “toll” revenues in resisting openness, and calls to enable this globally even if most users don’t switch.

- Comment pulse
  - Notarization preserves Apple’s gatekeeping → even with third‑party stores, Apple can block apps; undermines the law’s spirit. — counterpoint: still meets the letter of compliance.
  - Apple only moves under pressure → Japan support arrives days before the Dec 18 deadline, echoing EU’s last‑minute DMA rollout.
  - Follow the money → high‑margin services revenue (App Store “tolls,” Apple Pay) motivates resistance; global enablement risks a lucrative stream.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Japan mirrors the EU model: regional switches on, notarization intact; Apple optimizes for legal minimum while preserving control.
  - Impact: Developers like Epic/AltStore gain access; users in Japan get options; iOS policies fragment by region; regulators’ negotiating leverage increases.
  - Watch next: JFTC guidance on notarization and fees; Apple’s alternative‑store terms; Epic’s Fortnite payments; adoption metrics versus EU’s small early uptake.
