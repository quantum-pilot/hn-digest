# Carice TC2 – A non-digital electric car

- Score: 205 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45823186) | Link: https://www.caricecars.com/

- TL;DR
  - Netherlands-built Carice TC2 is a screenless, retro electric roadster focused on simplicity and low mass. At ~590 kg, rear-drive, it offers 200–300 km range (Type 2; 80% from 2.7 h), analog gauges, and customization. Starts at €44.5k ex‑tax; EU‑compliant, built to order with limited slots. HN likes the lightweight, analog vibe and privacy angle; debates “non‑digital” (EVs still need controllers), flags potential dash glare, and notes the price makes it a niche product.

- Comment pulse
  - Offline-first EVs are viable → many models run fine without data; users disable modems/SIMs. — counterpoint: connectivity aids preconditioning, charger status, maps, eCall.
  - “Non‑digital” means analog gauges → EVs still require BMS, charge and motor controllers; charging pilot can be simple, but cell balancing is complex.
  - Beautiful, featherlight toy → €44.5k+ pricing and bespoke production make it niche, not the affordable minimalist EV many want.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Retro, lightweight EV without screens tests demand for decontented, privacy‑respecting cars.
  - Impact: If buyers show up, OEMs and regulators may prioritize telematics off-switches and simpler HMIs.
  - Watch next: Independent range/efficiency tests, safety ratings, eCall compliance, and whether a true no-modem option is offered.
