# Carice TC2 – A non-digital electric car

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45823186) | Link: https://www.caricecars.com/

- TL;DR
  - Carice’s TC2 pitches a retro, screenless EV: small, light, and “non‑digital” inside, emphasizing analog gauges over infotainment. HN liked the privacy‑first, non‑connected ethos and simple design, but flagged real tradeoffs from dropping connectivity. Others clarified that “non‑digital” mostly means no screens; the car still needs electronics like BMS and controllers. Pricing lands high (€44.5k excl., €53.9k incl. NL VAT) with EU compliance confirmed; brushed‑metal dash glare drew concern alongside praise for a car‑not‑app philosophy.

- Comment pulse
  - Privacy-first, no modem/telemetry reduces attack surface and CVEs; some just pull the SIM (e.g., BYD). — counterpoint: connectivity enables remote HVAC, live charger data, maps, eCall.
  - Non-digital clarified: analog gauges, no screens; EV requires BMS, motor and charge controllers; charging handshake can be minimal (pilot resistor), but cell balancing is hard.
  - Design/ethos: Praised small/light retro feel; some want matte/wood/leather interiors. Others call it a wealthy plaything, not the affordable, spartan EV needed.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Screenless, low-software EVs are niche retro luxury, not mainstream—yet they spotlight overcomplexity and privacy concerns in modern cars.
  - Impact: May push OEMs to add offline modes, SIM switches, and guaranteed software sunsets for safety-critical connectivity.
  - Watch next: EU eCall requirements, real pricing after options, weight/efficiency specs, and independent tests of glare and usability.
