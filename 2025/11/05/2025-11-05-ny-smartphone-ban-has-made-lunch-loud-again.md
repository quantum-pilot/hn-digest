# NY smartphone ban has made lunch loud again

- Score: 178 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822539) | Link: https://gothamist.com/news/ny-smartphone-ban-has-made-lunch-loud-again

- TL;DR
    - New York schools restricting smartphones during the school day report louder, more social lunchrooms and fewer in-class AI/Google shortcuts. HN debates whether bans rebuild social skills or simply shift harms: lunch can be a bullying hotspot; enforcement is uneven; and society often adapts to tech rather than rolling it back. Many see momentum for limits—arguing they help focus and curb compulsive use—alongside calls not to trust platforms to self-regulate.

- Comment pulse
    - Bans restore attention and peer talk → Lunchrooms get lively; fewer AI shortcuts; MA proposes bell‑to‑bell school-day bans.
    - Enforcement is fragile → Social pressure and limited staff force selective policing; norms drift and workarounds persist.
    - Phones can buffer bullying → Private screens let outcasts avoid harassment — counterpoint: real-world interaction is needed to build social skills.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Time-boxed no-phone blocks plus intentional tech use beats blanket bans or unfettered access.
    - Impact: Students’ on-task time rises; teachers redesign assessments; parents lose instant access; platform engagement dips during school hours.
    - Watch next: statewide legislation passage, enforcement tooling (lockable pouches), cheating trends without AI, bullying reports, and academic outcomes over semesters.
