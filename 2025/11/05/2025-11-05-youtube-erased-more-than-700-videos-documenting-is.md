# YouTube erased more than 700 videos documenting Israeli human rights violations

- TL;DR
  - A report claims YouTube removed 700+ videos documenting alleged Israeli human-rights abuses. Commenters debate platform power versus preservation: some urge PeerTube/personal hosting, others note upstream deplatforming, attention-economy lock‑in, and the need for Tor-like resilience. One argues removals technically broke rules but suspects selective enforcement, especially around an IDF lynching. Others pivot to archiving via torrents and Wikipedia’s neutrality fight over “Gaza genocide”. The thread frames a larger problem: centralized distribution versus durable, verifiable evidence.

- Comment pulse
  - Centralization enables deplatforming → hosts, CDNs, registrars, app stores, ISPs can cut access; only Tor-like, censorship-resistant networks scale — counterpoint: reach still lives on YouTube.
  - Videos likely violated YouTube policies → removals followed rules; suspicion persists that enforcement escalated because footage showed an Israeli soldier lynching.
  - Archiving matters → users share torrents of takedown-prone footage and datasets; Wikipedia debate underscores pressure to maintain neutral tone on “Gaza genocide” article.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Platform moderation plus infrastructure chokepoints create single points of failure for human-rights evidence.
  - Impact: Journalists, NGOs, and courts lose discoverability and chain-of-custody context when evidence disappears from high-traffic platforms.
  - Watch next: Independent mirrors with cryptographic provenance; regulation on due process for removals; standardized hashes for conflict footage across platforms.
