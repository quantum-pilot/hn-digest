# YouTube erased more than 700 videos documenting Israeli human rights violations

- Score: 412 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822018) | Link: https://theintercept.com/2025/11/04/youtube-google-israel-palestine-human-rights-censorship/

- TL;DR
    - YouTube removed the channels of Al-Haq, Al Mezan, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, erasing 700+ videos documenting alleged Israeli abuses. Google cited compliance with new US sanctions targeting groups assisting the ICC’s Israel probes; legal advocates counter that informational materials are exempt and courts have already enjoined parts of the sanctions on First Amendment grounds. Some footage persists via archives; groups plan non‑US hosting. HN debates centralized platforms’ chokepoints, audience lock‑in, alleged uneven enforcement, and parallel efforts to preserve evidence via torrents and Wikipedia disputes.

- Comment pulse
    - Decentralize? → YouTube has audience; self-hosting gets cut off by registrars, hosts, CDNs, ISPs; search delisting buries content. — counterpoint: legal protections/regulation could curb upstream censorship.
    - Policy or bias? → Deletions matched YouTube rules, but commenters argue enforcement tightened when footage showed Israeli atrocities; TikTok cited as platform amplifying Gaza content.
    - Documentation resilience → Users share torrents and archives of takedown-prone footage; Wikipedia debates genocide terminology under NPOV, with founders urging attribution instead of wikivoice.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Sanctions compliance is colliding with platform policy; evidence preservation needs redundancy beyond US-controlled infrastructure.
    - Impact: Human rights documentation loses reach; researchers, journalists, and courts face harder discovery and chain‑of‑custody verification.
    - Watch next: Legal challenges to sanctions scope; platform transparency on government takedown requests; migration to EU hosts, IPFS/Tor mirrors, standardized evidentiary archives.
