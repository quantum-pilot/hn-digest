# NY school phone ban has made lunch loud again

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45822539) | Link: https://gothamist.com/news/ny-smartphone-ban-has-made-lunch-loud-again

- TL;DR
  NYC’s school-day smartphone ban is reshaping campuses: cafeterias are loud again, board games and books are back, and teachers report better focus (NYSUT: 89% climate, 76% engagement). Cardozo HS uses magnetic lock pouches; limited exceptions apply. Some students like the increased conversation and reading; others resent lost autonomy. Rule-bending persists (burners, broken pouches) under a strike system. The policy mirrors a 31-states-and-DC trend. HN readers call bans overdue, note AI had crept into classwork, and debate enforcement versus adapting to ubiquitous tech.

- Comment pulse
  - Phones obviously harmed attention and socializing → lunch should teach social skills — counterpoint: schools lacked levers; norms and external pressure constrained enforcement.
  - AI via phones was used mid-lesson → bans force genuine research; critics blame lax classroom discipline, while others say schools should modernize instead of reverting.
  - Cultural reset underway → bills like MA’s ‘bell-to-bell’ ban, plus growing distrust of Big Tech shaping stricter school-day limits.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ban improves attention and peer interaction, but needs predictable, minimally punitive enforcement and opt-outs for legitimate accommodations.
  - Impact: Winners: teachers, quieter hallways; Losers: edtech reliant on phones, students needing translation unless accommodated, administrators burdened by confiscation workflows.
  - Watch next: Measure changes in grades, bullying, attendance; compare managed modes vs pouches; watch MA bill results and speech or disability lawsuits.
