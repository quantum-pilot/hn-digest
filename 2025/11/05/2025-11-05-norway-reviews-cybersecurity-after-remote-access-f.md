# Norway reviews cybersecurity after remote-access feature found in Chinese buses

- Score: 342 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45824658) | Link: https://scandasia.com/norway-reviews-cybersecurity-after-hidden-remote-access-feature-found-in-chinese-buses/

- TL;DR
    - Norway’s Ruter found Romanian SIMs in Yutong e-buses enabling potential remote access; SIMs were removed and procurement/network/cloud controls tightened. The transport ministry will reassess suppliers outside security alliances. No misuse is known, but ~850 Yutong buses in Norway highlight reliance on foreign-connected fleets. HN splits between “normal telematics, overblown into geopolitics” and “real strategic risk,” citing rail precedents, China’s state-backed scale, and wartime logistics implications—alongside practical notes that European makers also ship buses with SIMs.

- Comment pulse
    - SIMs are standard telematics, not backdoors → fleet management uses roaming SIMs; features were documented and disabled — counterpoint: remote control still expands attack surface.
    - China’s state-backed scale creates strategic risk → rail giant undercuts bids, targets IP; EU blocked a protective merger, hampering Western alternatives.
    - Why buy Chinese near Scania/Volvo? → lower cost and earlier EV maturity won tenders; European buses also ship with SIMs—concern shifts to who holds access.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat connected vehicles as critical infrastructure; use zero-trust, disable remote control by default, require transparent telematics paths.
    - Impact: Procurement, regulators, and operators will add clauses, audits, and segmentation; vendors must offer on-prem control and provable remote-access off-switches.
    - Watch next: National guidance on fleet telematics, SBOM/firmware escrow, eSIM registries, red-team audits, and contract penalties for undisclosed connectivity.
