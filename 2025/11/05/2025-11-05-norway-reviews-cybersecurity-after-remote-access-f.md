- TL;DR
  - Norway is reassessing bus cybersecurity after discovering cellular remote-access in Chinese-made buses, prompting debate over backdoors versus standard fleet telematics. Some argue state-backed Chinese firms undercut to gain strategic leverage and IP, while others note the features were documented, disableable, and likely used with EEA-roaming SIMs. Procurement choices drew criticism—Norway skipped Scandinavian brands as Sweden buys BYD—underscoring cost, security, and dependency trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Chinese state-backed firms undercut to gain rail/bus footholds → strategic control and IP capture; EU blocked a defensive merger — counterpoint: it risked EU monopoly.
  - Norway bypassed nearby Scania/Volvo → cost wins; even Swedish regions buy BYD. Western buses also ship with SIMs—risk depends on who could control remote access.
  - SIMs likely support fleet management, not secret control → features were documented and disabled; Romanian SIMs plausible EEA roaming — counterpoint: some see anti-China FUD.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Remote access is normal; risk hinges on control, transparency, and isolation of telematics from safety-critical systems.
  - Impact: Tenders may demand local control of SIMs/servers, disable-by-default telemetry, and third‑party audits.
  - Watch next: Norway’s audit scope, EU procurement guidance, and independent teardown results of BYD/Ebusco systems and SIM provisioning.
