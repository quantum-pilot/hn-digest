# Ask HN: My family business runs on a 1993-era text-based-UI (TUI). Anybody else?

- TL;DR
  - Many businesses still run 1990s TUIs because they’re fast, reliable, and trainable via muscle memory and fixed layouts. “Modernized” GUIs/web apps often slow workflows with latency and mouse dependence. Old desktop apps endure for capability and small size; some survive via hacks (e.g., hex-editing date limits). Counterpoints: GUIs can match if designed keyboard-first and consistent; accreted menus hinder learnability; GUIs handle international text better. Some foresee TUI-friendly designs returning to enable cheaper LLM automation than vision-based agents.

- Comment pulse
  - TUIs deliver speed/reliability → fixed hotkeys, no scroll; staff reach muscle‑memory throughput; web/SSO latency adds hours. — counterpoint: training cost and accreted menus hurt newcomers.
  - GUI can match if keyboard-first → enforce consistent shortcuts, fixed-resolution screens, no scroll; failures are product decisions, not inherent to GUI.
  - Legacy persists for value/constraints → Comet, VB3 accounting, XP-era CAD; tiny binaries; occasional hex edits extend dates; GUIs handle international text better.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat TUIs as agent-native: deterministic screens and keystrokes beat brittle, vision-based RPA for automation.
  - Impact: Teams building ops/POS tools add complete keyboard schemas and stable screen models, improving both human power-use and LLM control.
  - Watch next: Measure keystroke-only throughput vs web flows; publish screen-graph APIs; demo agents reliably driving TUIs without OCR/vision.
