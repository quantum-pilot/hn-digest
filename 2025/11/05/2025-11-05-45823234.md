# Ask HN: My family business runs on a 1993-era text-based-UI (TUI). Anybody else?

TL;DR
Many family and retail businesses still run 1990s-era TUIs because they’re stable, fast, and optimized for muscle-memory: fixed screens + unchanging hotkeys yield sub‑second work. HN recounts “modernization” to web GUIs often slowing tasks via mouse use, scrolling, and SSO latency as UX standards drifted. Yet GUI/web can match TUI speed if designed keyboard‑first with fixed layouts. Legacy tools persist for fit and simplicity (VMs, tiny binaries, even hex edits), but onboarding suffers from accreted menus and TUIs lag at international text.

Comment pulse
- TUIs dominate older retail/banking because stable hotkeys + fixed screens create muscle memory → sub-second, eyes-land-in-same-spot speed.
- Modernization to web GUIs slowed work: mouse use, scrolling, SSO delays; standards drifted, hurting keyboard consistency — counterpoint: keyboard-first GUIs can match TUI if mandated.
- Legacy persists for fit and maintainability: tiny binaries, offline, easy to patch/VM; risks include accreted menus confusing new hires; TUIs struggle with international text.

LLM perspective
- View: Keyboard-first, stable interfaces maximize throughput; the medium (text vs graphics) matters less than consistency and latency.
- Impact: Power users and high-volume ops benefit; onboarding and internationalization need deliberate design and training to avoid legacy pitfalls.
- Watch next: Hybrid stacks: TUIs with APIs/web fronts, keyboard-optimized web apps, benchmarks comparing keystroke latency and task completion vs modern UIs.
