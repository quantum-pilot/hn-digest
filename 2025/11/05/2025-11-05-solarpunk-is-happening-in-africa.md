# Solarpunk is happening in Africa

- Score: 680 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45827190) | Link: https://climatedrift.substack.com/p/why-solarpunk-is-already-happening

- TL;DR
  - The piece argues that “solarpunk” is already real in Africa: cheap solar hardware + mobile money + PAYG + IoT lock/unlock let startups deliver household power and solar irrigation without waiting for grids. Carbon credits further subsidize costs, creating full‑stack moats (e.g., Sun King, SunCulture) and big social/economic benefits. Risks: FX, regulation, defaults, maintenance, and carbon price swings. HN pushes back on math inconsistencies/AI-y tone but largely agrees grid extension is uneconomic; questions remain on reliability, theft, and policy.

- Comment pulse
  - The numbers don’t add up → PAYG amounts for home vs. farm kits are conflated; per‑day vs. per‑month figures inconsistent.
  - Decentralized solar beats grid on cost and speed → permitting, transmission, and corruption stall grids — counterpoint: grid’s “nines” reliability is hard to match off‑grid.
  - Diffusion is real beyond Africa → Pakistan shows rapid uptake; China’s scale cut costs; theft/regulatory capture may slow South Africa; societal effects spark debate.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Separate product lines in the model; validate per‑unit cashflows and repayment vs. kerosene/diesel baselines by country.
  - Impact: FX hedging, local assembly, and pre‑paid carbon offtakes now drive affordability more than panel prices.
  - Watch next: Sodium‑ion storage pilots, DFI concessional credit facilities, standardized IoT MRV for credit issuance.
