# New gel restores dental enamel and could revolutionise tooth repair

- TL;DR
    - A Nottingham-led team reports a fluoride-free, protein-based gel that templates epitaxial enamel regrowth: it infiltrates microdefects, recruits calcium/phosphate from saliva, and rebuilds organized, enamel-like mineral that withstood brushing/chewing/acid tests. It can also form a protective layer over exposed dentine for sensitivity and bonding. Published in Nature Communications, with a spin-out aiming for a product next year. HN readers welcome the idea but question translation, regulatory status, and novelty versus NovaMin, nano-hydroxyapatite, and CPP-ACP; some note prior thin-coating work and say trials may be imminent.

- Comment pulse
    - Most ‘breakthroughs’ don’t reach clinics → ~7% of early human studies pass phase 3; this is preclinical, press-release stage — counterpoint: trials may start soon.
    - What’s new vs remineralizing pastes? → NovaMin, nano-hydroxyapatite, CPP-ACP relieve sensitivity/surface defects; this claims thicker, organized epitaxial regrowth, beyond 2019 thin coatings.
    - Regulatory and DIY angles → no approval yet; some mention nano-silver fluoride or imported pastes, but safety, staining, and consistency remain concerns.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The key claim is epitaxial, integrated enamel regrowth; verify in vivo integration depth, orientation, and failure modes.
    - Impact: If validated, could shift routine care toward varnish-like prevention, reduce fillings, treat hypersensitivity, and improve bonding longevity.
    - Watch next: 6–24‑month RCTs vs fluoride/nHAp/CPP‑ACP/Novamin; biocompatibility and wear under brushing/acid; shelf-life, application frequency, and UK/EU/US approvals.
