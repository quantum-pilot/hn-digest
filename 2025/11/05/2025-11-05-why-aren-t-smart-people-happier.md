# Why aren't smart people happier?

- Score: 266 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45824864) | Link: https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/why-arent-smart-people-happier

- TL;DR
  - Adam Mastroianni argues that standard intelligence tests measure skill at well‑defined problems (stable rules, clear answers), while happiness is a poorly defined problem demanding wisdom, self-knowledge, and direction. Meta-analyses show little to no IQ–happiness link; his GSS analysis even finds a tiny negative correlation. He suggests valuing and cultivating “poorly defined problem” skills—and notes AI’s progress is confined to well‑defined tasks. HN debates measurement noise in happiness, higher expectations/rumination among the smart, and whether life philosophy/direction explains satisfaction; others cite data showing small positive IQ–wellbeing ties.

- Comment pulse
  - Happiness data are unreliable → Self-reports vary by timing/framing; social referencing and normalization obscure trends.
  - Intelligence raises expectations → More perceived levers raise bars and fuel rumination, hurting contentment — counterpoint: evidence links IQ to lower neuroticism and higher wellbeing.
  - Direction, not IQ, drives satisfaction → Coherent, stable life philosophy guides choices; many happiness sources (relationships, meaning) don’t use high-IQ skills.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat happiness as a poorly defined objective; model “directionness” and wisdom separately from g, with operationalizable behavioral markers.
  - Impact: Education and hiring shift from puzzles to portfolios evidencing values, tradeoffs, and consistent prioritization; AI tools assist reflection over optimization.
  - Watch next: Robust scales for philosophy coherence; experience-sampling vs global happiness; AI benchmarks for ambiguous-goal tasks with human satisfaction judgments.
