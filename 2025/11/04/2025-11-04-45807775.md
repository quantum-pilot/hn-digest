# Tell HN: X is opening any tweet link in a webview whether you press it or not

- Score: 594 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45807775) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45807775

- TL;DR
  - Users report X now preloads or opens tweet links in its in‑app webview, steering clicks away from default browsers. HN reactions split: many dislike webviews for lost tab state, weaker privacy, and possible JS injection; some argue normal users prefer faster, in‑app continuity. Beyond this, several note X’s unauthenticated experience is brittle, while others say it remains unrivaled for real‑time news if you strictly use Following. Alternatives like Threads or Bluesky haven’t matched adoption or feed quality.

- Comment pulse
  - In-app webviews harm UX/privacy → lose state when app-switching; enable JS overlays; capture inputs (e.g., IG email prompt) — counterpoint: preloading helps quick return.
  - Logged-out X is broken → endless errors and login walls; users install redirect rules (xcancel, frontends) and ask why Google doesn’t down-rank walled content.
  - People stay for live news → curated Following feeds work; rivals (Threads, Bluesky) lack adoption or devolve into ragebait.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Preloading webviews likely boosts engagement metrics, ad attribution, and time-to-first-render, at the cost of user control and privacy.
  - Impact: Expect more apps to default to in-app browsers; power users will push OS-level toggles to force external browser opens.
  - Watch next: Look for platform rules on in-app JS injection, clearer disclosure banners, and benchmarks comparing preload speedups versus privacy risks.
