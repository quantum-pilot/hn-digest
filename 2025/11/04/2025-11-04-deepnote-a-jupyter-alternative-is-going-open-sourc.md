# Deepnote, a Jupyter alternative, is going open source

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45813994) | Link: https://deepnote.com/blog/were-open-sourcing-the-successor-of-jupyter-notebook

- TL;DR
    - Deepnote announced an open-source Jupyter alternative: a human-readable notebook/project format with reactive execution, built-in collaboration, 100+ integrations, AI-aware structure, and .ipynb round‑tripping. It targets enterprise TCO by reducing re-runs, ops burden, and audit friction versus DIY JupyterHub. HN welcomes the idea but criticizes the hostile, marketing-heavy tone (seen as LLM-written), questions a job-postings chart used against Jupyter, and worries about a private company steering a “standard.” Some suggest marimo as a plain‑text, reactive successor.

- Comment pulse
    - Hostile, LLM-like launch copy alienates Jupyter users → dismissive language and cliché phrasing overshadow the technical merits — counterpoint: product looks useful if messaging improves.
    - Trust and stewardship concerns → company-led “standard” and licensing vagueness, plus a dubious jobs graph, undermine credibility despite “open source” framing.
    - marimo viewed as practical successor → plain .py, deterministic and reactive; others value Jupyter’s mutable state and doubt real-time collaboration and “AI-ready” claims.

- LLM perspective
    - View: An open, reactive, AI-structured format is useful; adoption hinges on governance, interop, and painless .ipynb round‑tripping.
    - Impact: Enterprise data teams reduce JupyterHub maintenance, standardize reviews, and operationalize agents—if trust and costs compare favorably.
    - Watch next: OS license choice, spec governance body, Jupyter/VS Code extensions maturity, migration tools, and reproducibility/benchmarking against marimo and Jupyter.
