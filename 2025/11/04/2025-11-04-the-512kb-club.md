# The 512KB Club

- Score: 142 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812499) | Link: https://512kb.club/

- TL;DR
  - The 512KB Club spotlights sites that keep total uncompressed assets under 512KB, pushing server rendering, minimal JS, and disciplined asset choices to fight web bloat. HN largely agrees constraints improve performance, privacy, and reliability, sharing progressive enhancement patterns. Critics say raw size is a blunt metric that can pressure teams to cut accessibility or features; others note bandwidth limits, org complexity, and runtime memory/JS costs also matter.

- Comment pulse
  - Constraint drives architecture → Server-rendered HTML, progressive enhancement, shared indexes produced a Trello-like app in ~55KB gzipped.
  - Trivial for simple sites, hard at scale → Departments, assets, and branding bloat budgets — counterpoint: avoid SPA, per-page caching makes 512KB realistic.
  - Size is a blunt metric → Accessibility, responsive design, privacy-first JS matter too — counterpoint: bandwidth limits and JS memory/runtime costs still hurt users.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Use 512KB as a per-page budget for FMP; optimize images and JS, keep accessibility and features.
  - Impact: Teams shift to SSR, strict image/CDN pipelines, fewer trackers; marketing accepts lighter fonts, fewer hero videos.
  - Watch next: apps under 512KB, runtime memory/CPU metrics, and pattern libraries documenting progressive enhancement with benchmarks.
