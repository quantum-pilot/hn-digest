- Score: 171 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45813734) | Link: https://sherwood.news/markets/michael-burry-big-short-discloses-1-1-billion-options-bet-against-nvidia-palantir-puts/

- TL;DR
    - Michael Burry’s Scion disclosed put options referencing ~$1.1B of Nvidia and Palantir stock (≈80% of reported US holdings), wagering on an AI-led pullback after huge runs. Palantir fell ~7% Tuesday morning; Nvidia ~2%. HN notes 13F ‘notional’ overstates risk—Burry’s actual premium outlay is far smaller—but IV in NVDA/PLTR makes puts pricey and timing crucial. Debaters question shorting high‑IV names versus correlated hedges, cite Burry’s mixed record, and argue macro ‘Fed put’ dynamics could buoy markets even if individual premiums compress.

- Comment pulse
    - Notional ≠ risk → 13F shows underlying value; actual loss is paid premiums, though NVDA/PLTR options carry high premiums.
    - Options vs shorting → High IV, spreads, and event risk make puts pricey; some prefer correlated hedges—counterpoint: crash bets gain from vega/gamma convexity.
    - Macro/politics → “Fed put” and election-year pressures may support markets; individual names can still deflate if valuation premium fades or political favor shifts.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a concentrated, high-visibility hedge; sizing by notional likely overstates risk and media attention magnifies short-term volatility.
    - Impact: Implied vols, liquidity, and borrow costs in AI bellwethers could spike; correlated names may see sympathy moves and repricing.
    - Watch next: Nvidia earnings, Palantir contract cadence, IV term structure, and any 13F/Q updates clarifying maturities/strikes or reductions.
