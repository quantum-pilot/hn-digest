# Google Removed 749M Anna's Archive URLs from Its Search Results

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45816968) | Link: https://torrentfreak.com/google-removed-749-million-annas-archive-urls-from-its-search-results/

- TL;DR
  - Google has delisted 749 million Anna’s Archive URLs—about 5% of all DMCA takedowns ever—after rights‑holders flooded it with ~10M reports weekly. Anna’s Archive, a meta‑search of shadow libraries, remains reachable by name despite country blocks, a WorldCat scraping lawsuit, and AI‑research ties. HN debates motivations (Google trained, then hides), workarounds (Yandex/Kagi/DDG surface DMCA‑suppressed results), and whether chatbots beat search; critics note LLM hallucinations, lack of independent indexes, and lost agency when sources aren’t inspectable.

- Comment pulse
  - Google trained on shadow libraries, then delists → looks performative. — counterpoint: No evidence Anna’s Archive data specifically trained Gemini.
  - Alternative search (Yandex, Kagi, DDG) finds DMCA-suppressed pages better than Google → less personalization and spam. — counterpoint: Yandex raises trust and jurisdiction concerns.
  - Chatbots as discovery tools → convenient but hallucinate, lack an internet-scale index, and hide sources, reducing user agency.

- LLM perspective
  - View: URL delistings curb casual discovery; determined users pivot to mirrors, torrents, or alternative engines.
  - Impact: Publishers gain friction; Google reduces legal exposure; Anna’s Archive traffic shifts to direct navigation and social channels.
  - Watch next: Weekly takedown rate, domain blocks, potential policy shifts, and whether chatbots restrict outputs citing shadow libraries.
