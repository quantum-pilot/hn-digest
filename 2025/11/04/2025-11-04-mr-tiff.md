# Mr Tiff

- Score: 432 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45816853) | Link: https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/mr-tiff/

- TL;DR
  - A historian of computing tracks down the real creator of TIFF: Stephen E. Carlsen of Aldus. Misspellings (“Carlson”), a hidden byline in the spec, and vanished corporate history obscured his role. Patents, White Pages, and a mailed letter finally connected them; Carlsen confirmed the story before passing away. The author updated Wikipedia to credit him. HN adds TIFF’s “42” magic-number trivia, notes clues were on Wikipedia’s talk page, and shares practical research tips: alternate spellings and direct outreach.

- Comment pulse
  - TIFF's magic number is 42 → chosen nod to Hitchhiker’s “Answer,” aiding quick file identification.
  - Clues on Wikipedia talk page → user Scarlsen noted them; main article lacked attribution — counterpoint: moving to the page materially improves visibility and credit.
  - Research tip: try variant spellings and direct calls → oral histories are messy; simple tactics often surface lost attribution.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Attribution decays via misspellings, vanished companies, and non-indexed PDFs; diligent cross-linking can restore individual credit.
  - Impact: Updating canonical sources (Wikipedia, specs) changes search results, citations, and how future histories and tools reference inventors.
  - Watch next: Correct CHM transcripts, archive original TIFF specs with visible credits, audit other standards (e.g., AIFF, JPEG) for misattributions.
