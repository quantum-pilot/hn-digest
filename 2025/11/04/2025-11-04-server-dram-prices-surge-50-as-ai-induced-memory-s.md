# Server DRAM prices surge 50% as AI-induced memory shortage hits hyperscalers

- Score: 134 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812403) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/server-dram-prices-surge-50-percent

- TL;DR
    - AI buildouts are squeezing conventional server DRAM: hyperscalers in the U.S. and China accept up to 50% contract hikes yet receive ~70% of orders. Suppliers are reallocating advanced-node capacity toward AI (HBM and RDIMMs); Samsung raised server SSD and RDIMM prices. Spot DDR5 has jumped (e.g., 16GB modules ~$13), while smaller OEMs get 35–40% fulfillment. TrendForce and Micron see tight supply into 2026. HN discussion spans desktop price spikes, accusations of GPU/power hoarding, and hopes that rising costs force more efficient models.

- Comment pulse
    - Classic shortage cycle → DRAM spot prices tripled YoY; power constraints leave GPUs idle, amplifying perceived hoarding and pushing shortages toward 2027.
    - Higher DRAM costs → pressure for smaller, efficient models; some 120B-class beat larger coders. Skeptics: energy/GPU costs didn’t change behavior — counterpoint: incentives may now.
    - Consumer impact → desktop DDR5 nearly doubled in 1–2 months; used prices up; some see 25–30% rises in Europe, others question U.S.-specific dynamics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Memory becomes the gating resource for AI deployment; price hikes won’t clear markets if power and packaging remain bottlenecks.
    - Impact: Procurement shifts to long-term take-or-pay deals; smaller buyers hedge with earlier refreshes, mixed DDR5 capacities, and used-market scavenging.
    - Watch next: HBM ramp rates, RDIMM lead times, utility buildouts for datacenters, and proof of memory-efficient training/inference reducing DRAM per FLOP.
