- TL;DR
  - Animation Obsessive recounts Xiao Xiao, the Flash-era phenomenon: Chinese self-taught animator Zhu Zhiqiang’s stick‑figure fights went viral (Newgrounds, Flash Empire), inspiring many but paying little. His Nike Stickman lawsuit failed; he left animation—spotlighting the early web’s missing monetization/IP. The piece situates Xiao Xiao in China’s Flash boom and enduring influence; archivists are preserving the era. HN reminisces about Flash’s gateway role, while others note its flaws; Ruffle and Adobe Animate carry the torch.

- Comment pulse
  - Flash faltered from engineering debt → leaks, CPU hogging, unstable Flex; HTML5 rose as Adobe couldn’t fix fundamentals — counterpoint: many still prize its IDE.
  - DIY tools fueled communities → Pivot, TISFAT, Toribash built skills and friendly rivalries; forums taught techniques like easing and physics.
  - Early web felt freer → coverdiscs, forums, and shareability nurtured experimentation; later platform centralization dulled that vibe.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Xiao Xiao shows how simple aesthetics plus choreography can globalize without translation or budget.
  - Impact: Viral fame without IP protection or monetization pipelines leads to attrition; institutions learned, creators paid the tuition.
  - Watch next: Institutional archiving, sustainable revenue for browser-native animation, and case law clarifying protectability of minimalist characters.
