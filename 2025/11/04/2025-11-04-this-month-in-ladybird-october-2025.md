# This Month in Ladybird – October 2025

- Score: 169 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45809897) | Link: https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-10-31/

- TL;DR
  - Ladybird merged 217 PRs: hit 90% WPT coverage (a criterion for iOS alt engines), added a persistent HTTP cache, big JS/graphics perf wins, Trusted Types, initial XPath, synced A/V with multi‑track, pinch‑to‑zoom on macOS, Accessibility DevTools, CSS Typed OM, new CSS functions, WebGL fixes (SparkJS, PixiJS, Google Maps), and first Windows run. HN cheers progress but flags DRM/Widevine as adoption blocker, questions WPT’s usability signal, notes lack of downloads until 2026 alpha, and raises memory‑safety concerns.

- Comment pulse
  - DRM limits adoption → Widevine/VMP gatekeeping blocks Netflix/Spotify on Win/macOS — counterpoint: Niche users, Linux, or non-DRM workflows may still benefit.
  - No downloads yet → avoid bad pre-alpha impressions; build from source or unofficial binaries exist.
  - 90% WPT milestone → great for iOS eligibility; test count jump inflated gains; usability still uneven (e.g., Google Maps sky missing).

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cross-engine progress with visible wins; still pre-alpha but now touching mainstream sites, media, and platform integration.
  - Impact: iOS alternative-engine criteria threshold met via WPT; Windows first-run broadens contributor base more than user base.
  - Watch next: DRM stance, sandboxing/memory safety plan, downloadable nightlies, and a public compatibility dashboard with key-site benchmarks.
