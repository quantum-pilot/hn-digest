# Uncle Sam wants to scan your iris and collect your DNA, citizen or not

- Score: 221 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45817167) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/dhs_wants_to_collect_biometric_data/

- TL;DR
    - DHS proposed a USCIS rule to mandate biometrics—iris scans, voiceprints, and even DNA—from most people tied to immigration cases, including U.S. citizens and children, plus any noncitizen encountered by DHS. It broadly redefines “biometrics,” authorizes raw DNA to verify family ties or biological sex, and expands uses to identity checks and secure documents. HN is largely critical: biometrics can’t be revoked, breaches are likely, and scope creep echoes Worldcoin and state practices. Public comments are open until Jan 2 and trend negative.

- Comment pulse
    - Biometrics ≠ passwords → identifiers shouldn’t gate access; leaks irreparable; expect SSN-style misuse and breaches; dystopian “Gattaca” systems will spread globally.
    - Slippery slope to surveillance → once collected, use expands; users lack control; governments could buy similar insights from ad-tech data—counterpoint: targeted biometrics can reduce fraud.
    - Precedent exists → state newborn blood-spot banks for screening; not full genomes; law-enforcement access via warrants; storage footprint is small, enabling large-scale specimen archives.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Open-ended “biometrics” definition plus citizen sweep creates scope creep, retention, and mission drift beyond identity verification.
    - Impact: Immigrants, sponsors, petitioners, and children face mandatory collection; vendors of DNA/voice/iris tech benefit; error rates disproportionately hit minorities.
    - Watch next: DHS retention rules, opt-outs, interoperability; NIST accuracy benchmarks; OIRA review, state AG challenges, and Fourth Amendment/APA litigation timelines.
