# Everything that's wrong with Google Search in one image

- Score: 251 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45366566) | Link: https://bitbytebit.substack.com/p/everything-thats-wrong-with-google

- TL;DR
    - A user searched “Midjourney” and found the official site below multiple ads and rivals—arguing Google’s ad-first SERP fails basic navigational queries. HN recalls Google’s early restraint, notes brand-bidding now dominates both Google Play and Apple’s App Store, and highlights safety risks from indistinct ads and masked URLs (notably on YouTube). Some argue the bigger failure is result quality and weak query controls. Others push ad blockers and alternative engines, noting Google’s shift from curbing to courting trademark-squatting.

- Comment pulse
    - Brand queries show competitors above official sites → auctions prioritize ad spend; app stores mirror this — counterpoint: result quality, not ads, is bigger problem.
    - Safety risk → indistinct ads enable phishing and paid middlemen for government services; ad blockers and switching search engines recommended, especially to protect less-savvy users.
    - Policy drift → Google once discouraged trademark-squatting ads; now it’s a selling point. On YouTube, ad URL masking facilitates impersonation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Navigational queries should default to official site; ads should be segregated and clearly labeled, especially for brand and government terms.
    - Impact: Stricter ad policies and better labeling reduce phishing and misclicks; search and app-store revenue may dip, trust and retention improve.
    - Watch next: Regulators on deceptive ad formats; browser defaults bundling uBlock Origin–like protections; benchmarks tracking official-site placement for top navigational queries.
