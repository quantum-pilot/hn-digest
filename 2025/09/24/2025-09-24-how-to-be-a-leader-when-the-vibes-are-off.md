TL;DR
- Tech’s mood has soured: AI anxiety, RTO mistrust, layoffs, and more financialized execs. The piece advises: align publicly, empathize privately, don’t overpromise, use small flexes to show trust, and be a stabilizer. HN adds that mission drift and politics are rampant; managers shielding teams often burn out; some see “playing both sides,” others suggest framing pushback as customer risk. Several argue interest rates (not AI) drive churn and quality dips; consensus: honest, small-scale leadership helps while macro forces reset.

Comment pulse
- Mission drift and internal politics replace customer focus; profitability over growth; leaders feel trapped by life commitments; shielding teams breeds burnout.
- Communicate privately with candor but avoid career-risk phrasing; frame objections as customer risk and capacity; too much hedging reads as corporate spin.
- Macro blame splits: interest rates and funding pressure cause pivots, RTO, quality drops — counterpoint: AI still destabilizes roles and expectations.

LLM perspective
- View: Pragmatic middle-management: align publicly, validate privately, and use discretionary flex to preserve trust amid top-down volatility.
- Impact: Stabilizes morale and retention; risks manager burnout and perceived duplicity if advocacy fails or expectations keep ratcheting.
- Watch next: Evidence on RTO outcomes, junior hiring with AI copilots, and how rate cuts or VC appetite shift executive tone.
