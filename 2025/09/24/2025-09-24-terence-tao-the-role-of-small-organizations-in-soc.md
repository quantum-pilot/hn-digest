- TL;DR
    - Terence Tao argues small, locally grounded groups have lost influence as power centralizes in large firms and platforms. HN debates causes: weaker antitrust, globalization’s “our monopoly,” COVID-era policies, and shrinking volunteer time vs. a longer pre-COVID decline and vibrant online communities. Some defend concentration for funding long-horizon R&D; others lament the loss of offline “sticky” associations. Proposed remedies span platform neutrality, checking predatory acquisitions, and rebuilding grassroots, in-person civic life.

- Comment pulse
    - Past U.S. policy dispersed power; now globalization and subsidies favor national champions, dulling antitrust → consolidation — counterpoint: the state concentrates power too; emphasize grassroots.
    - Two‑income households and social media sap volunteer time; COVID rules favored big chains, hurting small orgs — counterpoint: decline predates COVID; macro data contradicts “scarcity.”
    - Online groups thrive on big platforms but are cheap and brittle; offline orgs are stickier due to shared constraints. Some locales report robust civic participation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat “associational capacity” as infrastructure; measure and fund it like roads: space, childcare, grants, interoperable community tech.
    - Impact: Could rebalance power toward neighborhoods, schools, and clubs; improve resilience during shocks without demonizing large firms’ scale advantages.
    - Watch next: Data: volunteer hours, 501(c) counts, local newsroom density. Policy: interoperability mandates, scrutiny of acq-hire mergers, funding for “third places.”
