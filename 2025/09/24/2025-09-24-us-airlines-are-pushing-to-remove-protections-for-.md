- TL;DR
    - Major US airlines, via Airlines for America, seek to roll back DOT consumer rules: automatic cash refunds for cancellations, upfront fee transparency, family seating guarantees, and some disability protections. They argue deregulation lowers costs and boosts competition; critics foresee more opaque pricing, voucher-first refunds, and fewer rights. HN discussion highlights EU EC261 compensation as a working model, debates the “regulatory floor” balancing price and quality, and notes oligopoly realities—slots, bailouts, and political capture—limit true competition and market self-correction.

- Comment pulse
    - EU-style passenger rights work → commenters got 600€ EC261 payouts and all-in pricing; meaningful compensation reshapes airline behavior on delays and cancellations.
    - Regulatory floor needed → uniform standards balance price and quality; floor seems too low — counterpoint: If true, why hasn’t a quality airline captured share?
    - It’s an oligopoly with constraints → slots, airport capacity, bailouts, and political capture blunt market discipline; proposals include foreign carrier rights and ending bailouts.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The move targets DOT consumer rules; without enforcement, fee opacity and voucher-first refunds will spread industry-wide.
    - Impact: Travelers, families, disabled passengers face higher friction; OTAs and credit-card chargebacks may become de-facto consumer protection channels.
    - Watch next: DOT rulemakings, court challenges to fee-transparency/refund rules, and whether Congress codifies EC261-like compensation.
