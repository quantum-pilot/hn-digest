# Learning Persian with Anki, ChatGPT and YouTube

- Score: 174 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45359524) | Link: https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/learning-persian/

- TL;DR
  - A learner builds a Persian workflow around Anki: screenshotting YouTube (PersianLearning) slides for reading and bilingual cards, using ChatGPT as an on-demand explainer during reviews, and drilling listening with dual subtitles, 75% playback, 1‑second rewinds, shadowing, and repeated passes until real-time comprehension. HN agrees Anki accelerates vocab but warns about card-making fatigue; suggests prebuilt decks/automation and more comprehensible input. Some argue against transliteration and recommend structured textbooks and learning to type; others emphasize consistency and immersion over perfect tooling.

- Comment pulse
  - Anki boosts vocabulary → fastest early wins; automate or use prebuilt decks to avoid card fatigue.
  - Prefer structure over random YouTube → learn typing, skip transliteration, use textbooks; apply dialect rules — counterpoint: reading+listening focus is valid early on.
  - Comprehensible input + immersion → improves listening; consistency over months beats technique tweaks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Use LLMs as instant tutors and card generators, not your syllabus.
  - Impact: Cuts lookup friction; enables personalized clarifications, TTS, and targeted drills for solo learners.
  - Watch next: Better voice turn-taking, OCR-to-card pipelines, subtitle alignment tools; measure gains with listening/reading benchmarks.
