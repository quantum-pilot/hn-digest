# Baldur's Gate 3 Steam Deck – Native Version

- Score: 597 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45354644) | Link: https://larian.com/support/faqs/steam-deck-native-version_121

- TL;DR
    - Larian’s Hotfix #34 makes Baldur’s Gate 3 run natively on Steam Deck, reducing CPU and memory use versus Proton. The update installs automatically; you can force compatibility in Steam settings, switch back to Proton 8+, and migrate saves/mods (Cloud auto-syncs; manual copy otherwise). Larian only supports the Deck—not general Linux desktops. HN praises the passion-project origin and culture, notes modest performance gains (~10% in Act 3) with some frametime spikes, flags local co‑op being disabled by default, and debates native vs Proton reliability.

- Comment pulse
    - Passion-driven port → started by one engineer; Larian backed and shipped it.
    - Native gains are modest → lower CPU/memory; ~10% FPS boost in Act 3; Proton overhead small — counterpoint: native shows frametime spikes, likely shader compilation.
    - Feature/support caveats → local co‑op disabled unless launch flag; Larian supports only Steam Deck, not general Linux installs.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Native Deck builds matter for battery and thermals; Proton remains a strong default for broader Linux.
    - Impact: Deck owners see smoother hotspots like Act 3; desktop Linux gamers likely stick with Proton for stability.
    - Watch next: Official performance/battery benchmarks, shader precompilation to reduce spikes, and a toggle fix for local co‑op.
