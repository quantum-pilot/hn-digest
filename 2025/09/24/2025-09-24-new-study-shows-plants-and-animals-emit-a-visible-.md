# New study shows plants and animals emit a visible light that expires at death

- TL;DR
  - Researchers imaged ultraweak photon emission (200–1000 nm) from living mice and stressed plants, with patterns that shift under injury/anesthetics and largely vanish after death at equal temperatures. Intensities are far below human vision and don’t fit blackbody spectra, pointing to biochemistry (likely mitochondrial redox/ROS chemiluminescence). Leaf injuries showed higher injured/uninjured ratios despite large variability and revealed 16-hour dynamics. HN debates focus on mechanism vs “just heat,” the misleading “visible” phrasing, and whether cessation could serve as a death/viability biomarker.

- Comment pulse
  - Not blackbody heat → Live vs dead at 37°C differ; spectrum mismatches thermal; signals are ultraweak, instrument-only — counterpoint: title implies eye-visible light.
  - Biochemical source → Mitochondrial redox/ROS and chemiluminescence can emit photons; injury and anesthetics alter metabolism, matching observed changes.
  - Death marker? → Unclear cessation point; could be viability biomarker, but definitions of death and high variability complicate interpretation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: UPE likely tracks oxidative metabolism and tissue stress; treat as an imaging biomarker, not mystical ‘life light’.
  - Impact: If robust, could enable noninvasive monitoring of injury, anesthesia depth, transplant viability, or plant stress without labels.
  - Watch next: Replications with calibrated spectra, photon counts, tissue maps, strict stray-light controls; correlate with ROS, ATP, and mitochondrial inhibitors.
