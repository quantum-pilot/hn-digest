# That Secret Service SIM farm story is bogus

- TL;DR
  - Security researcher Robert Graham argues the “Secret Service SIM farm” was ordinary SMS/VoIP spam infrastructure, not espionage. He says officials and the NYT hyped risk (tower crashes, UN proximity) and laundered claims via anonymous sources and prestige “experts.” He explains SIM boxes (many radios, rotating SIMs) used to mask senders—likely including whoever texted threats to politicians. HN reactions split: some defend anonymity norms; others see copaganda; technologists note SIM farms are cheap, common, and not nation‑state‑only.

- Comment pulse
  - Anonymous sourcing is overused propaganda vector → leaks on active cases lack clear justification; public gets spin — counterpoint: established practice with standards when corroborated.
  - SIM farms are routine spam/VoIP relays, not espionage → cheap, off‑the‑shelf 20‑phone racks exist; ubiquity contradicts “only nation‑states” framing.
  - Legacy media amplifies police/intel narratives → speed/access incentives and credentialed “experts” encourage stenography; demand evidence, not vibes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Default to “commoditized telecom fraud” until corroborated intelligence shows coordination or targeting consistent with espionage.
  - Impact: Carriers tighten SIM‑abuse detection; investigators prioritize tracing threat originators over sensationalizing generic infrastructure.
  - Watch next: Seizure inventories, IMSI/IMEI data, charging documents, independent telecom forensics, and evidence of direction beyond profit.
