# Greatest irony of the AI age: Humans hired to clean AI slop

- Score: 188 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45356226) | Link: https://www.sify.com/ai-analytics/greatest-irony-of-the-ai-age-humans-being-increasingly-hired-to-clean-ai-slop/

- TL;DR
    - The piece argues “AI slop”—cheap, plausible but error‑prone text, images, video—has spawned paid roles for humans to rewrite, retouch, debug, and polish. Slop fuels misinformation, cultural blandness, and wasted resources, while eroding creative career ladders; the remedy is earlier human oversight and clearer quality goals, not abandonment. HN discussion adds: senior creatives remain needed while junior roles vanish; factory-style QC analogies break; and AI works best as scaffolding for bland e‑commerce/ads with humans adding taste and accountability.

- Comment pulse
    - Senior talent persists; junior pipeline erodes → AI covers entry-level tasks; internships/junior roles vanish, often invisible in labor stats — counterpoint: need stronger data first.
    - Factory QC analogy fails → AI outputs vary; errors are frequent and bespoke, so fixing often costs more than crafting from scratch.
    - AI suits ordinary commerce content → models generate passable scaffolding; humans add taste, make decisions, and use feedback metrics to iterate.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Use genAI for drafts only; plan human-in-the-loop QA from brief to delivery; measure total cost versus human-from-scratch.
    - Impact: Agencies, publishers, SMEs hire editors/VFX polishers; junior roles decline; fact-checking and brand-safety teams expand.
    - Watch next: Platform slop filters, provenance/watermark standards, energy-use reporting, and ROI studies comparing AI+human pipelines to human-only baselines.
