# Rights groups urge UK PM Starmer to abandon plans for mandatory digital ID

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45359356) | Link: https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/press-releases/rights-groups-urge-starmer-to-abandon-plans-for-mandatory-digital-id/

- TL;DR
  - UK rights groups (Big Brother Watch, Liberty, ORG, others) urge Starmer to drop a mandatory digital ID aimed at immigration control, warning of routine ID checks, scope creep, and limited efficacy. HN debate splits: a single GOV.UK One Login could streamline services and verification (e.g., like eVisa share codes), but it’s authentication—not entitlement—and won’t fix NHS fragmentation. Nordic/Brazil/Poland examples show big convenience gains alongside exclusion risks from phone dependence. Trust dominates: UK outsourcing and mission creep vs. Swiss-style optional, open-wallet models.

- Comment pulse
  - Unified login boosts efficiency and data-sharing; eVisa share-codes already simplify checks; UK nationals lack equivalent — counterpoint: doesn't fix NHS fragmentation/authorization gaps.
  - Overseas systems (Nordics, Brazil, Poland) show convenience—but device dependence locks people out (old phones, no smartphones), raising exclusion risk; Swiss e-ID isn’t mandatory.
  - Core fear: governance—outsourcing, low-bid builds, mission creep; demand public ownership, open standards, privacy-by-design — counterpoint: NHS COVID app showed open, competent delivery possible.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Separate authentication (SSO) from authorization/entitlement; design minimal, optional digital credentials with strict purpose limits.
  - Impact: Benefits accrue to service delivery and fraud reduction; harms hit digitally excluded and civil liberties if mandates expand.
  - Watch next: Starmer’s statement; scope (immigration-only vs cross-service), opt-out paths, offline tokens; governance model and code transparency.
