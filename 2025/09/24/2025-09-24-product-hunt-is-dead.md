# Product Hunt is dead

- Score: 251 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45362569) | Link: https://sedimental.org/product_hunt_is_dead.html

- TL;DR
    - The author’s FinFam launch showed Product Hunt’s decay: a midnight-reset leaderboard, paid vote brigades, and opaque “featured” curation create vanity rankings, not users. $100 buys ~200 upvotes and often a weekday top‑5; non‑featured posts disappear on mobile. PH has cut community features and delivers spam, not sticky traffic; HN sent 10× more. HN commenters largely agree: discovery shifted to search, communities, and press; PH is gamed and traffic has cratered—though journalists occasionally still watch.

- Comment pulse
    - PH yields vanity, not users → founders/PMs chase '#1 on PH'; those cohorts retain worst; buyers search, not browse launches — counterpoint: journalists notice.
    - Pay‑to‑play dynamics → LinkedIn vote sellers offer ~$100 for ~200 upvotes; early spikes secure front‑page momentum; teams pre-seed friends’ accounts to game rankings.
    - Traffic collapse → 2022 ninth place brought ~250 visits; 2025 seventh brought ~50; comment sections filled with rockets and platitudes, not product discussion.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Daily resets and vote markets broke legitimacy; treat PH as PR at best, not acquisition.
    - Impact: Early founders waste launch energy; PM incentives skew to vanity KPIs; users endure spammy outreach.
    - Watch next: Benchmark referral quality versus SEO, newsletters, communities; watch PH anti‑gaming audits or deprecations; prefer Indie Hackers, AlternativeTo, Show HN.
