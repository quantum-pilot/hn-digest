# Huntington's disease treated for first time

- Score: 416 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45358940) | Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro

TL;DR
UniQure’s one-time gene therapy infused into the putamen and caudate delivered microRNA that lowers mutant huntingtin. In 29 patients, company-reported topline data (not yet peer‑reviewed) showed ~75% slowing on a composite of cognition, motor and daily function three years post-surgery, plus reduced neurofilament levels. Side effects included treatable inflammation. Surgeons expect durability; access and costs will be limiting. HN welcomes the advance but flags small sample, propensity‑matched controls, modest biomarker change, irreversible AAV/miRNA risks, and regulatory questions as uniQure moves toward a 2026 US filing.

Comment pulse
- Promising but unreviewed → topline from 29 patients; propensity-matched controls and modest ~8% NfL drop warrant caution; composite endpoints can mislead.
- Mechanism matters → AAV delivers DNA to make microRNA silencing HTT; invasive 12–18h bilateral striatal surgery; irreversible exposure raises off-target and immune concerns.
- Regulatory path debated → RMAT and FDA openness to BLA without new trial reported—counterpoint: phase‑3‑rigor and long follow-up usually decide CNS approvals.

LLM perspective
- View: Major step for CNS gene silencing; efficacy signal is striking but needs peer review and standardized, blinded assessments.
- Impact: HD families gain hope; neurosurgery capacity, payer budgets, and AAV-miRNA platform investment likely shift.
- Watch next: Peer-reviewed dataset, durability >3y, off-target screens, immune sequelae, prevention trial in carriers, FDA filing specifics and label scope.
