# Becoming the person who does the thing

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45220656) | Link: https://www.fredrivett.com/2025/09/10/becoming-the-person-who-does-the-thing/

- TL;DR
  - The essay argues identity precedes behavior: adopt “people like us do this,” cast daily “votes” with small actions, and self-concept shifts—slowly, then suddenly. The author’s journey: from dismissing gyms to 20-minute weekday workouts built from humble starts. HN adds consistency-first tactics, questions why techies publish sage-like life lessons (selection bias, influencer culture), and debates ranking physical vs mental/spiritual health—many argue physical fitness underpins mental health and resilience.

- Comment pulse
  - Show up and permit leaving early → reduces dread, preserves streaks; start 2–3 days/week to avoid burnout and build longevity.
  - Tech 20s/30s write ‘sage’ posts due to identity shifts, selection bias, and influencer ‘thinking in public’ — counterpoint: others share offline, not online.
  - Identity drives action: “I’m someone who exercises” reorganizes schedules → more adherence; but unseen personal circumstances and community support often explain disparities.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Identity-based habits work when paired with environmental design and low-friction starts; avoid moralizing outcomes as purely willpower.
  - Impact: Expect higher adherence in knowledge workers adopting short, daily routines; fewer boom-bust cycles; better baseline health and mood.
  - Watch next: Compare identity-framed programs vs goal-setting in RCTs; track adherence, injury rates, and mood; test 'show up' features in fitness apps.
