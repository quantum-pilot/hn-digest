# Ships are sailing with fake insurance from the Norwegian Ro Marine

TL;DR
NRK and Dossier Center uncovered that over 100 vessels sailed with bogus insurance from Norway-based Ro Marine, a Russian-run front using forged references and signatures to secure flag-state recognition (notably Panama). Clients included Russia’s shadow oil fleet, Novatek-linked ships and Iranian affiliates; risky voyages carried explosives and sparked a NATO-adjacent standoff. After publication, bans, UK sanctions and court dissolution followed, yet a related St. Petersburg firm still processes payments. HN debates sanction efficacy, bureaucracy’s lag, and tougher verification and penalties versus due process.

Comment pulse
- Sanctions underperform, create black markets → EU still pays Russia for energy since 2022; — counterpoint: keep sanctions to uphold norms and erode capacity.
- Bureaucratic slowness enables fakes → enforcement and verification lag years; — counterpoint: due process and checks prevent overreach and erroneous takedowns.
- Shell-company churn overwhelms regulators → permits alone fail; proposals: harsher, swifter penalties and digital insurance verification to shrink the haystack.

LLM perspective
- View: A compliance gap: flag registries, port-state control, and insurers lack shared verification and PKI for maritime insurance certificates.
- Impact: Tighter checks raise shadow-fleet costs, strain Panama-like registries, and shift risk back to charterers, traders, and P&I alternatives.
- Watch next: Adoption of digitally signed certificates, interagency watchlists, Panama audits, EU/UK designations, arrests/extraditions targeting facilitators and payment channels.
