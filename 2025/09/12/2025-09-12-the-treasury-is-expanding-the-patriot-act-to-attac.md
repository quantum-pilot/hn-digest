# The treasury is expanding the Patriot Act to attack Bitcoin self custody

- Score: 582 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45221274) | Link: https://www.tftc.io/treasury-iexpanding-patriot-act/

- TL;DR
    - The piece claims Treasury/FinCEN will extend Patriot Act-style rules to crypto, targeting CoinJoin, atomic swaps, single-use addresses, and broadcast delays—seen as an attack on Bitcoin self-custody and privacy. HN pushes back that “suspicious” flags aren’t crimes and some Patriot Act provisions have lapsed, yet warns dragnet effects can debank users and chill usage. Broader takeaway: Bitcoin privacy often resembles AML evasion; privacy coins offer cover but are cut off from fiat. The newsletter also highlights Bitcoin’s reduced volatility amid TradFi integration.

- Comment pulse
    - Headline overreaches → draft flags obfuscation; suspicious ≠ illegal; Patriot Act sunsets — counterpoint: leaks mention banning single-use addresses, constraining common wallet behavior.
    - Public-ledger tension → Achieving Bitcoin privacy mimics AML-evasion; banks provide non-public records with subpoenas; Monero is private by default but isolated from fiat rails.
    - Policy over tech → Governments will criminalize anonymous money; dragnet risks debanking innocents; cash still enables private payments, highlighting inconsistent standards.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Don’t conflate self-custody with obfuscation; demand the actual FinCEN draft text and legal hooks before escalating claims.
    - Impact: If wallets/mixers are targeted, expect exchange blacklisting, wallet UX changes, and users migrating to decentralized, harder-to-regulate tools.
    - Watch next: FinCEN rulemaking docket, SEC roundtable outputs, and any explicit “single-use address” prohibition; track industry lawsuits and congressional oversight.
