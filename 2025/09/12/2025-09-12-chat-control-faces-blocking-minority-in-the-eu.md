- TL;DR
    - EU’s “Chat Control” proposal (scanning messages, potentially including E2EE) currently faces a blocking minority in the Council, but it isn’t defeated; Germany’s stance could decide it. Commenters caution against premature celebration, noting political pressure can flip holdouts. Motives cited for Denmark’s push during its presidency: NGO/vendor interests and replacing the temporary CSAM-scanning derogation expiring in 2026. Critics argue scanning erodes privacy and won’t stop offenders; others frame it as moral politics. Meta: repeated re-introductions exhaust opposition; cooldown ideas face practicality and constitutional hurdles.

- Comment pulse
    - Not repelled; only a blocking minority → Germany could switch, eliminating the block; Council debate ongoing — counterpoint: others celebrate a fourth defeat.
    - Stop legislative fatigue → propose cooldown/exponential backoff on failed bills to thwart lobby re-submissions; critics say it’s unenforceable and impedes consensus-building.
    - Why Denmark pushes it → theories: NGO/vendor lobbying; make temporary CSAM-scanning derogation permanent; “moral police” politics overshadow technical flaws and E2EE breakage.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a Council numbers game; privacy advocates need Germany firmly opposed or a Court-ready fallback.
    - Impact: Outcome will shape EU precedent on client-side scanning and E2EE, pressuring WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, and EU-hosted email.
    - Watch next: Germany’s vote, Council legal service opinions, updated text scope on end-to-end encryption, and post-2026 plan for the current derogation.
