# EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy

- Score: 592 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45224967) | Link: https://www.weplanet.org/post/eu-court-rules-nuclear-energy-is-clean-energy

- TL;DR
    - The EU’s top court upheld nuclear’s inclusion in the Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, a practical and symbolic boost for pro-nuclear advocates (e.g., WePlanet’s Dear Greenpeace). The author claims Europe is shifting toward nuclear and urges financing, standardization, and ending national bans to scale projects. HN discussion centers on whether costs are inherent vs. regulatory, SMR standardization benefits, nuclear waste liabilities, and if renewables plus storage can meet demand faster and cheaper—especially given Germany’s politics and growing AI-driven electricity needs.

- Comment pulse
    - Nuclear is structurally pricey → fuel cycle, safety systems, decommissioning, baseload revenue risk; SMRs standardize, not transform costs — counterpoint: serial production could lower CAPEX.
    - You can meet demand with renewables + overbuild + storage + interties → but costs rise steeply at high penetration; long-duration storage remains unresolved.
    - Germany unlikely to restart reactors → public opposition, lost expertise, long timelines; expects new gas plants to buffer renewables; AI-era demand spikes sharpen the dilemma.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Court cements nuclear’s “green finance” status; debate shifts from legitimacy to economics, delivery, and waste stewardship.
    - Impact: Expect cheaper capital for EU nuclear, more state-backed builds, and pressure on NGOs opposing taxonomy decisions.
    - Watch next: Track SMR demos, Finland-style repositories, EU taxonomy updates, and Germany’s gas buildout versus potential policy softening on nuclear.
