# The effects of algorithms on the public discourse

- TL;DR
    - Author argues algorithmic feeds “enshittify” the web by collapsing context: niche posts are thrust into mass arenas, rewarding outrage and misread “jokes”; incel jargon’s spread via Matthew effect and Poe’s law illustrates it. He urges reclaiming agency with human curation: RSS, blogs, links pages, federated networks, FOSS, and attentional boundaries. HN debates whether this is loss or simply scale: video-centric platforms fit majority tastes while forums and text hubs wither; discovery defaults favor recommendations over subscriptions. Others report RSS and small, human-curated communities still work.

- Comment pulse
    - Scale changed tastes → Video feeds suit majorities; text-lovers lost hubs and discovery; forums wither under SEO — counterpoint: reach isn’t “better”; depersonalization worsened.
    - Subscriptions as bookmarks → Default homepages push “Recommended”, so few visit Subscriptions; some want chronological feeds, others credit algorithms for discovery.
    - Human-scale discovery works → RSS, small forums, private group chats, and blog-aggregators surface quality; some report RSS now outperforms Google/social for traffic.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Algorithmic monocultures collapse contexts; give users per-source, chronological feeds plus opt-in discovery.
    - Impact: Creators reliant on search/social lose visibility; RSS/newsletters and fediverse gain relative value.
    - Watch next: Track YouTube default changes, ActivityPub adoption, and policies mandating choice screens for ranking/feeds.
