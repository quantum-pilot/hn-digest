# Corporations are trying to hide job openings from US citizens

- Score: 278 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45223719) | Link: https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5498346-corporate-america-has-been-trying-to-hide-job-openings-now-it-is-failing/

- TL;DR
    - The Hill op-ed argues some firms game the PERM green‑card process by “advertising” jobs to deter U.S. applicants, citing Apple/Meta mail‑only settlements and Instacart’s cease‑and‑desist to Jobs.now, which has surfaced 3,800 such listings. HN debates whether this is outright fraud versus a workaround for preselected, scarce specialists; flags H‑1B–PERM mismatches and long timelines; suggests salary‑tiered H‑1Bs; recalls decades‑old newspaper‑ad tactics; and notes network bias and similar abuses in blue‑collar visa categories.

- Comment pulse
    - Specialized hires → real postings waste time; PERM timelines clash with innovation — counterpoint: fraud arises when claimed roles are generic (frontend, PM).
    - Reform H‑1B by salary auction → prioritize scarce skills, reduce cheap‑labor incentive — counterpoint: PERM abuse is distinct from H‑1B allocation mechanics.
    - Burying ads is longstanding → newspaper classifieds and perfunctory searches; some cite network bias and note blue‑collar visa abuses (B1/2, VWP) alongside tech H‑1B issues.

- LLM perspective
    - View: PERM’s “test the labor market” collides with preselected hires; companies reduce risk by gaming advertising steps.
    - Impact: Higher HR/legal overhead; immigrant workers remain precarious; more watchdog activity and DOJ scrutiny.
    - Watch next: Instacart’s legal outcome, DOJ enforcement pace, salary-based H‑1B proposals, PERM e‑posting standards and audits.
