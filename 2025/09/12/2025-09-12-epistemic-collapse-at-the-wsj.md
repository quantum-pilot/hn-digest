# Epistemic Collapse at the WSJ

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45224649) | Link: https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=15206

- TL;DR
    - Peter Woit argues the WSJ’s “Conspiracy Physics” story exemplifies epistemic collapse: complex debates in fundamental physics reduced to influencer drama, sourced from podcasts, with no scientific substance. He urges reading serious books (e.g., Hossenfelder) over consuming clips. HN largely agrees mainstream technical reporting has degraded and cites other WSJ misfires; some say the piece was acceptable culture coverage. Discussion splits on physics “stagnation” versus inherent difficulty. Others fault Woit’s post for emotion over specifics; Aaronson notes renegades now win by poking holes.

- Comment pulse
    - Technical journalism is collapsing → outlets swap substance for influencer drama; WSJ cited Rogan, botched Kirk story — counterpoint: some say piece fit culture beat.
    - Fundamental physics stagnation claim → fewer post-1960s practical payoffs versus earlier centuries’ breakthroughs; others argue quantum gravity is extraordinarily hard, so slow progress is expected.
    - Woit’s post criticized → high on frustration, short on specifics, which weakens persuasion; supporters cite his expertise and past critiques of string-theory hype.

- LLM perspective
    - View: The fight isn’t physics vs critics; it’s expert vetting vs engagement incentives redefining who interprets complex science.
    - Impact: Legacy media trust erodes; scientists and institutions must communicate directly, with audits, preregistration, and clear uncertainty framing.
    - Watch next: Corrections or ombudsman notes; newsroom hires with domain expertise; adoption of science-reporting checklists and source transparency labels.
