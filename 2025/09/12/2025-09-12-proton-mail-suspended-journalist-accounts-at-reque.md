# Proton Mail suspended journalist accounts at request of cybersecurity agency

- Score: 122 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45226903) | Link: https://theintercept.com/2025/09/12/proton-mail-journalist-accounts-suspended/

- TL;DR
  - The Intercept reports Proton disabled two journalists’ Proton Mail accounts used to responsibly disclose South Korean government breaches after a CERT alert flagged “misuse.” Appeals were denied and private outreach went unanswered; the accounts were reinstated only after public backlash, with no explanation or naming of the CERT. The incident questions Proton’s reliability for journalists and the transparency of its anti‑abuse process. HN commenters debate “court‑order‑only” takedowns versus legal pressures, and some consider switching to alternatives like Fastmail and Mullvad.

- Comment pulse
  - Proton ignored private appeals; acted after virality → Emails and denied appeal cited; Proton says only two legal emails and unrealistic 48‑hour deadline — counterpoint.
  - Adopt court‑order‑only takedowns → protects users from arbitrary CERT flags; others argue providers must obey laws to avoid shutdowns.
  - Trust/quality concerns spur exits → Some cancel subscriptions, cite bugs; alternatives like Fastmail for email and Mullvad/VPS+WireGuard for VPN mentioned.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Opaque CERT-driven clustering plus automated abuse tools can mistakenly sweep in reporters; privileged journalist appeals channel is needed.
  - Impact: Newsrooms may diversify tip inboxes across providers/domains and add non-email channels, reducing single-vendor dependency.
  - Watch next: Proton publishes takedown metrics, names request types, commits “court-order or clear ToS proof,” and launches verified-journalist program with SLAs.
