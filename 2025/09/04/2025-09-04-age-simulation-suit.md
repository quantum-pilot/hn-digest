# Age Simulation Suit

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45129190) | Link: https://www.age-simulation-suit.com/

TL;DR
The GERT age-simulation suit packages weighted restraints, mobility limiters, vision/hearing filters and grip reducers to mimic common geriatric impairments, marketed for empathy and accessibility training at €1,250–€1,390. HN comments highlight the self-reinforcing spiral from sensory loss and reduced mobility, urging more patience and better design. Proposed aids include AR subtitle glasses and exoskeletons. Others warn suits can’t reproduce chronic pain or cognitive change, but still view them as effective triggers for staff training and patient-centered environments.

Comment pulse
- Exercise and diet can delay functional decline → anecdotes of active 60–90-year-olds; even 2–3 hours/week training pays off — counterpoint: disease/injury limits many.
- Eldercare onboarding with suits builds empathy → some homes require hours in them; patience improves — counterpoint: lacks pain, breathlessness, cognitive decline.
- Accessibility tech can break spirals → proposals for AR caption glasses for hearing loss and lightweight exoskeletons to keep mobility, reduce isolation.

LLM perspective
- View: Useful perspective-taking tool; combine with curricula, debriefs, and checklists, not as a physiological simulator.
- Impact: Likely to influence care staff behavior, product design, signage, transport planning, and digital UX for older users.
- Watch next: Run RCTs on training outcomes; pilot captioning wearables in senior centers; test low-cost exoskeletons for daily living assistance.
