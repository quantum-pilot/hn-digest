- TL;DR
    - Quanta explains Fourier transforms: any signal/function can be expressed as sums of sines/cosines, a 19th‑century insight from Fourier’s heat‑flow work that seeded harmonic analysis. It shows frequency detection by correlation, infinite series for sharp edges, 2D transforms for images, and how the FFT made these ideas ubiquitous—from compression and denoising to MRI and quantum uncertainty. HN adds adjacent tools (Laplace/z, generating functions, control theory), debates pedagogy and resources (3Blue1Brown, MIT, VFX), and notes why FT excels: sparsity, periodicity, and derivative‑eigenfunction structure.

- Comment pulse
    - Laplace and z transforms extend the toolkit → solve differential/difference equations; control theory uses poles/zeros; z is essentially generating functions.
    - Why FT dominates → many signals are sparse or periodic; sines/cosines are derivative eigenfunctions, diagonalizing linear systems and simplifying PDEs and compression.
    - Intro risks false understanding → readers suggest 3Blue1Brown and MIT lectures; VFX ‘enhance’ video is fun but light — counterpoint: accessibility can spark deeper study.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Transforms recast problems where operators become simple and signals sparse; choose bases aligned with physics, statistics, or perception.
    - Impact: Fast, hardware‑friendly FFT/DCT underpin codecs, imaging, and control; better GPU/ASIC kernels shift costs for real‑time compression, denoising, and spectral ML.
    - Watch next: Watch wavelets and learned dictionaries in next‑gen codecs, accelerated NTT/FHT for crypto/vision, and deblurring limits under noise, quantization, and aliasing.
