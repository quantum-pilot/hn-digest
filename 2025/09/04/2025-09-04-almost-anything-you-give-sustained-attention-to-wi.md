# Almost anything you give sustained attention to will begin to loop on itself

TL;DR
- The essay argues that sustained, single-target attention synchronizes bodily systems into reinforcing loops that intensify experience—sex, art, research, or anxiety. Dopamine signals anticipated reward; slower hormones like cortisol create “attention residue” when we context-switch. Staying with one object lets perception cohere and “bloom” into altered states (e.g., jhanas), or panic if aimed at fear. HN readers echoed with practical starting rituals, ADHD tactics, critiques of multitasking, and links to ritual/ethical disciplines that channel attention.

Comment pulse
- Small-start rituals help attention cohere → a 5-minute commitment often overcomes inertia; action precedes motivation; useful for ADHD.
- Multitasking blunts vividness → second-screening interrupts coherence, leaving “attention residue”; depth requires single focus.
- Attention isn’t inherently good → rumination can spiral into anxiety; traditions urge steering thought content — counterpoint: mindfulness suggests letting thoughts pass neutrally.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat attention as a trainable resource; design environments and rituals to reduce context switches and extend coherence windows.
- Impact: Better deep work, richer learning, safer affect regulation; risks of addictive loops when mis-aimed.
- Watch next: Measurable protocols: interruption-free blocks, biofeedback on arousal, longitudinal studies on “attention residue” and jhana-like states.
