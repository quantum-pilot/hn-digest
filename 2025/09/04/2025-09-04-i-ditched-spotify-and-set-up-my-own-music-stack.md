# I ditched Spotify and set up my own music stack

- TL;DR
    - The author replaces Spotify with a self-hosted stack: Navidrome via Cloudflare Tunnel, Lidarr+sabnzbd for library management, lrcget (via Kasm) for synced lyrics, and Last.fm/Lidify for discovery. Benefits claimed: lossless quality, privacy, ownership, offline access, and direct artist support through purchases (e.g., Bandcamp). HN readers debate “fair” compensation and suggest user-centric payouts; share simpler or alternative stacks (Jellyfin/LMS, Tailscale, Syncthing); and note the time/maintenance tradeoff, with some preferring human curation or buying/ripping over algorithmic discovery.

- Comment pulse
    - Fair pay is complex: per-stream ≠ fair; many stakeholders; user-centric payouts preferred — counterpoint: CD-era math suggests streams can equal past per-listen revenue.
    - DIY stacks work (Navidrome/Jellyfin/LMS, Tailscale, Syncthing), but some prefer simple: buy/rip, local sync, Bandcamp apps, human-curated radio over algorithms.
    - Time is the hurdle: people want offline-first clients; advice is start small, rip CDs, cache libraries; Tailscale enables secure remote access.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Self-hosting reduces platform risk and lock-in; discovery suffers, and metadata/backup hygiene become ongoing chores.
    - Impact: Artists gain when listeners buy directly; platforms may shift toward user-centric payouts if churn grows among engaged listeners.
    - Watch next: CLI lyrics tools, better Last.fm/ListenBrainz recommendations, and simpler mobile offline sync could mainstream self-hosted stacks.
