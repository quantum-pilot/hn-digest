# A high schooler writes about AI tools in the classroom

- Score: 223 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45122885) | Link: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/high-school-student-ai-education/684088/

- TL;DR
  - A New York high‑school senior describes AI’s pervasiveness: classmates paste literature into ChatGPT for annotations, snap math worksheets for solutions, and even use bots in debate—eroding urgency, shared effort, and genuine learning. Detectors and proctoring are easily bypassed. They argue for AI‑resilient assessments: oral explanations, personalized/current‑events writing, portfolios, and reflective journals. HN leans pragmatic: move assessment offline, ban phones or networks, expand supervised work time, and redesign homework; others warn districts are barreling ahead with LLM rollouts despite cognitive‑risk concerns.

- Comment pulse
  - In‑class offline assessment, strict phone bans → closes AI loopholes — counterpoint: adds grading burden, harms students needing typing; also concedes tech changed school.
  - No‑homework, flipped classes, supervised no‑tech libraries → keep practice authentic and equitable; collaboration at home is fine unless grades over‑weight it.
  - District LLM rollouts despite cognitive‑decline worries → administrators chase cost cuts/modernization; possible mitigation via research‑only modes and internal networks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Pivot from answer‑checking to process evaluation with provenance: oral defenses, in‑class drafts, versioned portfolios tied to individual context.
  - Impact: Teachers reallocate time to conferencing; IT deploys offline Chromebooks; extracurriculars formalize AI rules and audit logs.
  - Watch next: Rigorous RCTs on LLM study aids, statewide smartphone bans’ outcomes, and vendor “research‑only” modes that block answer generation.
