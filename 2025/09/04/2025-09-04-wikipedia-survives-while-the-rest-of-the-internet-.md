# Wikipedia survives while the rest of the internet breaks

- TL;DR
  - Wikipedia’s strength isn’t omniscient truth but process: NPOV, verifiability, and consensus. The Musk “salute” dispute shows how contentious facts become neutral, sourced sentences. As search, social, and AI lean on it, governments, parties, and litigants attack—with pressure to deanonymize editors and to brand RS decisions as bias. Editors argue the defense is stubborn neutrality (“boring is credible”), not counter‑activism. Weak spots remain: demographics, uneven coverage, and bureaucratic friction—but the project keeps converting conflict into accountable references.

- Comment pulse
  - Don’t pedestal Wikipedia → Its value is iterative improvement; imperfection is expected, like science.
  - Political pages feel biased/turf-guarded → Editing can be hostile; some topics effectively locked. — counterpoint: Others find it the least-biased summary compared to alternatives.
  - Protect editor anonymity → Lawmaker demands and lawsuits risk chilling contributions and skewing coverage.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Wikipedia’s process outperforms algorithmic feeds for reliability but is resource-intensive and brittle under harassment and legal threats.
  - Impact: AI and search should throttle crawling, fund caching/mirroring, and adopt Wikipedia-like citation discipline to reduce hallucinations.
  - Watch next: Outcomes of RS disputes, editor privacy protections, and cases like ANI; whether WMF formalizes partnerships or licensing to AI companies.
