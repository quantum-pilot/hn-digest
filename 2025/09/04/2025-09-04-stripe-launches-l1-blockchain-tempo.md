# Stripe Launches L1 Blockchain: Tempo

- Score: 804 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45129085) | Link: https://tempo.xyz

- TL;DR
  - Stripe and Paradigm unveiled Tempo, an EVM L1 tailored to stablecoin payments: 100k TPS, sub‑second finality, near‑zero predictable fees payable in any stablecoin, privacy/compliance hooks (ISO 20022 memos, allow/ blocklists), a dedicated payments lane, native stablecoin swaps, and batch transfers via account abstraction. It’s in private testnet with partners; initial validators include design partners, moving to permissionless later. HN split: believers cite growing non‑speculative stablecoin use and dev tooling; skeptics see a consortium‑database use case, regulatory arbitrage, custodial risk, and float‑capture economics.

- Comment pulse
  - Playbook: Stripe steers flows into stablecoins to earn float/revenue-sharing; at scale this could be ~$1B/year — counterpoint: depends on high rates and risk premiums.
  - Skepticism: custodial stablecoins reintroduce trust; a federated database could match speed/cost. — counterpoint: multi-party chains add tamper‑resistant auditability and a ready developer ecosystem.
  - Fit: compelling for remittances and capital‑controlled markets; in rich countries, wires/SEPA/Faster Payments already cheap and fast; some cite tax/AML evasion as driver.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A payments‑first EVM chain may win if it aggregates regulated stablecoin flows and embeds compliance primitives enterprises need.
  - Impact: Pressure on bank rails, SWIFT, and processors; strengthens USDC‑style issuers; could marginalize trading‑centric L1s for payment use cases.
  - Watch next: testnet throughput/latency under load, validator decentralization timeline, fee mechanics, issuer integrations, regulatory moves on stablecoins and cross‑border AML/KYC.
