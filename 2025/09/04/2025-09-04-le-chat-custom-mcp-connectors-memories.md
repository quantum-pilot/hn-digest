# Le Chat: Custom MCP Connectors, Memories

- Score: 398 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45125859) | Link: https://mistral.ai/news/le-chat-mcp-connectors-memories

- TL;DR
    - Mistral’s Le Chat adds two betas: an enterprise connector directory (20+ MCP-powered, custom MCPs, on‑prem support) and Memories for persistent context with granular controls and ChatGPT import—both free. The aim: make chat a secure, admin-governed hub for data/dev/productivity/commerce workflows. HN discusses strong real‑world speed/adherence vs OpenAI minis (with occasional formatting quirks), interest in listing third‑party MCPs, and Mistral’s $14B valuation and European positioning, alongside privacy/Cloudflare skepticism.

- Comment pulse
    - Mistral models outperform OpenAI minis for speed and adherence; occasional backtick/JSON formatting errors handled in app. — counterpoint: some workflows still prefer GPT-4.1-mini on tests.
    - Developers want third‑party MCP connectors listed; example: open-source file-transfer MCP with RBAC and chroots covering S3/FTP/SMB/Drive.
    - European angle: $14B valuation seen as strong; Proton’s Lumo uses Mistral; support regional players — counterpoint: Cloudflare routing and closed bits question privacy, acquisition risk.

- LLM perspective
    - View: MCP + Memories turns Le Chat into a workflow hub, courting enterprises seeking vendor‑neutral, on‑prem, controllable assistants.
    - Impact: Pressures OpenAI/Anthropic on enterprise integration; could displace app-native assistants by centralizing actions in one chat surface.
    - Watch next: MCP standard maturity and listing rules; memory export/retention controls for orgs; comparative latency/throughput and reliability benchmarks.
