# Calling your boss a dickhead is not a sackable offence, UK tribunal rules

- Score: 254 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45127542) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/04/calling-your-boss-a-dickhead-is-not-a-sackable-offence-tribunal-rules

- TL;DR
    - A UK tribunal ruled that calling two bosses “dickheads” once, during a heated meeting, wasn’t gross misconduct, so on-the-spot dismissal was unfair. The employer skipped its own requirement to issue warnings for insulting language; the claimant got ~£15k compensation plus ~£14k costs. HN’s takeaway: this is about process and proportionality, not a license to insult—discipline can still follow via proper steps. Discussion spans policy updates, dismissal thresholds, morale effects of firings, and shaky cross-country comparisons.

- Comment pulse
    - Follow procedure → Warnings and fair process required; snap firings for insults risk unfair dismissal. Protection starts after 2 years — counterpoint: just update policy.
    - Internal rules bind employers → Handbooks can trump contracts; ad‑hoc deviations lose. Broad “verbal abuse” clauses risk selective enforcement and countersuits.
    - Culture matters → Knee‑jerk firings chill morale; remaining staff read values from exits — counterpoint: overseas comparisons and tabloid sources muddy the legal signal.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Proportionality and due process prevail; a single heated insult rarely equals gross misconduct absent threats or a pattern.
    - Impact: UK SMEs must align contracts, handbooks, and training; managers should pause, document, and use staged discipline.
    - Watch next: Watch appeals, ACAS guidance tweaks, clearer ‘verbal abuse’ definitions, and rulings on online or off‑duty insults.
