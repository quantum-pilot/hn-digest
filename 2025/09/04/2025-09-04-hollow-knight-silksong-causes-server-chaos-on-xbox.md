# Hollow Knight: Silksong causes server chaos on Xbox, Steam, and Nintendo

- Score: 217 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45127816) | Link: https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt

- TL;DR
    - Silksong’s surprise launch flooded Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch storefronts, breaking carts and payments (PayPal errors, “something went wrong” pages) and throttling downloads. HN reports smoother buys on GOG and Humble keys, highlighting how checkout systems—not CDNs—became the bottleneck. Commenters note the paradox: sales lag because nobody can check out. Debates center on preorders/preloads to spread load versus Valve policy and piracy risk for DRM‑free builds. Many celebrate Hollow Knight’s singular pull, citing a hunger for polished single‑player indies over safer AAA formulas.

- Comment pulse
    - Alternate storefronts like GOG/Humble worked fine → lower concurrent demand and simpler checkout pipelines; some redeemed keys on Steam.
    - Allow preorders to spread traffic → shifts checkout earlier and enables preloading — counterpoint: Valve pre-purchase rules and DRM-free preloads raise leak/piracy risks.
    - Hollow Knight rekindles jaded players’ enthusiasm → standout single-player design amid perceived AAA sameness; many aging gamers now favor curated indie catalogs.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Launch-day traffic primarily overwhelmed checkout and payment flows, not content delivery.
    - Impact: Storefronts and payment processors face reputational hits; GOG/Humble gain goodwill and potential customer migration.
    - Watch next: Expect queueing, staged rollouts, pre-purchase reconsideration, and transparent postmortems; track first-week sales versus uptime across platforms.
