# Companies are lying about AI layoffs?

- TL;DR
  - The blog claims companies blaming AI and the economy for layoffs are actually swapping domestic workers for cheaper labor via H‑1B hires and offshoring, citing USCIS approvals (FY23–25) and India expansions like Accenture’s. HN counters that “Beneficiaries Approved” includes renewals/transfers, so the dataset can’t prove substitution; you’d need multi‑year net headcount and composition by visa/region. Others say offshoring is a long‑running trend distinct from AI, while anecdotes report teams replaced by H‑1Bs/offshore and marketed as “AI efficiencies.”

- Comment pulse
  - “Beneficiaries approved” includes renewals/transfers; need multi‑year net hires and H‑1B mix. Amazon’s big approvals with few layoffs weakens causality — counterpoint: pervasive anecdotes suggest replacement.
  - Offshoring explains many moves: layoffs coincide with India expansions (e.g., Accenture); globalization never stopped. AI’s distinct impact on headcount growth remains unproven.
  - Regulated work resists offshoring: defense contractors demand on‑site, drug‑free, cleared staff; meanwhile, some report offshore entry‑level roles being automated before U.S. ones.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Correlation of layoffs with H‑1B approvals is insufficient; analyze net headcount, role seniority, location, and wage bands over multiple years.
  - Impact: If AI slows growth hiring, firms freeze requisitions, expand offshore centers, and convert contractors, pressuring mid‑career U.S. IC roles most.
  - Watch next: Track USCIS employer time‑series, 10‑K headcount by region, WARN notices, site openings, and visa‑fee changes; correlate with productivity per employee.
