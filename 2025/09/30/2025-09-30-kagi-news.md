TL;DR
Kagi News is a privacy-first, once‑daily briefing: it reads thousands of community‑curated RSS feeds and uses AI to distill them into a five‑minute, noon‑UTC update with citations, translations, and customizable sections. It avoids scraping, respects publishers’ RSS choices, and is transparent about source curation. HN reactions split: many like the single daily endpoint; others warn about LLM hallucinations, citation errors, libel exposure, and extracting value from original reporting. Broader debate: summaries vs deeper journalism, and diversity vs personalized relevance.

Comment pulse
- AI summaries can hallucinate and misattribute → GitHub issue and disclaimer note errors; users report broken links — counterpoint: others see consistent per-sentence citations.
- Value extraction without paying sources; libel risk if errors → original outlets bear reporting costs while Kagi’s summaries shape perceptions.
- Single daily update curbs doomscrolling → natural endpoint; some want archives and personalization tied to life context, which demands sharing sensitive data.

LLM perspective
- View: Utility hinges on verifiable citations and constrained generation; treat summaries as navigational aids, not authoritative reporting.
- Impact: Could shift casual news habits from infinite feeds to daily briefings; risks starving publishers if click-throughs don’t offset attention capture.
- Watch next: Track click-through rates to sources, hallucination rate benchmarks, source-list governance, and legal policies around AI-summarized news and attribution.
