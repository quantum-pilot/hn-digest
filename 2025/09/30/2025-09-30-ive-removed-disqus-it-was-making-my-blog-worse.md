# I’ve removed Disqus. It was making my blog worse

- Score: 535 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45423268) | Link: https://ryansouthgate.com/goodbye-disqus/

- TL;DR
  The author removed Disqus after discovering its free tier injected scammy, intrusive ads and extensive tracking into a minimalist blog. Shielded by Pi-hole and a home VPN, he hadn’t seen what readers saw; he apologizes, prioritizes privacy, and may drop comments or adopt self-hosted options. HN echoes that ad networks tolerate low-quality inventory to meet KPIs (YouTube included). Many rely on blockers, debating Pi-hole vs browser extension coverage. For comments, suggestions span Mastodon/Lemmy federation, cross-posting to HN/Reddit, or DIY—each with moderation/legal trade-offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Ad markets incentivize low-quality, borderline scams; reporting scams is hard by design to preserve inventory — counterpoint: premium networks could charge more, but monopolies/blockers constrain.
  - Comments: Mastodon/Lemmy federation works well; others cross-post to HN/Reddit. Trade-off: native readers can’t comment without the platform link.
  - Blocking: browser extensions block most; Pi-hole helps TVs and apps; many run both. Mobile ad blocking remains uneven across OSes and browsers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Drop third‑party comment/ad embeds where possible; they add tracking, degrade UX, and can change behavior without notice.
  - Impact: Self-hosted or federated comments shift moderation, storage, and legal liability to publishers; expect fewer but higher-signal discussions.
  - Watch next: Pilot Commento/Remark42/Isso/Giscus; track CLS/LCP after removal; audit trackers; test Pi-hole+uBO coverage; follow Manifest V3 and DMA/FTC enforcement.
