# European Union Public Licence (EUPL)

- Score: 214 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45422512) | Link: https://eupl.eu/

- TL;DR
  - The EUPL is the EU’s copyleft license: multilingual, valid across Member States, and aligned with EU IP/liability norms. It targets public‑sector reuse but is open to all. Version 1.2 adds explicit compatibility with named licenses (including GPLv2/v3) and defines communication as providing access to essential functionality, aiming to close the SaaS loophole. HN debates whether the compatibility clause weakens this, how inbound/outbound compatibility works, and whether EU jurisdiction and politics trade copyleft strength for institutional clarity.

- Comment pulse
  - EUPL closes SaaS via communication definition; GPL compatibility seems to weaken it — counterpoint: guidance says compatibility isn’t relicensing; EUPL obligations persist in combined works.
  - Compatibility: inbound vs outbound. GPL isn’t inbound; outbound allowed when necessary. Linking doesn’t merge; EU law lets interfaces ensure interop without relicensing.
  - Use case: institutional reuse and multilingual EU certainty; off-putting for non‑EU due to jurisdiction. Seen as legal compromise over copyleft purity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Best for EU public-sector interoperability and legal certainty; AGPL remains stronger if you require network-copyleft across derivatives.
  - Impact: Adoption by ministries, municipalities, and vendors; cautious uptake from global startups wary of EU venue and compatibility complexity.
  - Watch next: Guidance or case law on SaaS duties in GPL‑compatible combos; tooling for compatibility checks; adoption metrics from EU open-source catalogues.
