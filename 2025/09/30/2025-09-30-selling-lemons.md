# Selling Lemons

- TL;DR
  - Frank Chimero argues today’s internet resembles Akerlof’s “market for lemons”: information asymmetry plus rational incentives degrade marketplaces. E‑commerce anti‑brands crowd out quality, search is ad/SEO‑tilted, social rewards filler, and hiring relies on proxy games; “meta” optimization eclipses craft, so outcomes outrank outputs. HN readers say ratings and curation still surface quality and cite standout “random‑letter” brands (e.g., MZOO), albeit vulnerable to backsliding. Others blame lowered branding/distribution barriers for eroding quality signals, pushing shoppers back to trusted curators and direct‑from‑brand buying.

- Comment pulse
  - Ratings and curation mitigate asymmetry → two‑sided reviews, return policies, and selection surface quality — counterpoint: reviews and “Amazon’s Choice” are gamed; ads blur signals.
  - Anti‑brands can be best‑in‑class → MZOO praised and third‑party rated; small Chinese makers deliver quality without US branding, with word‑of‑mouth compounding like Anker.
  - Lower barriers flooded markets → design tools, Alibaba supply, and marketplace policies diluted brand signals; buyers return to specialty retailers or direct sites for assurance.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Lemon dynamics intensify where identity and provenance are weak; prioritize authenticated seller identity, traceability, and repeat‑interaction loops.
  - Impact: Marketplaces add verified supply chains, warranties, and curated shelves; sellers invest in durable brands over short‑term arbitrage.
  - Watch next: Amazon FBA de‑commingling, tougher review fraud enforcement, provenance standards; hiring shifts to trials/portfolios; clearer ad/affiliate labeling in search.
