# How the AI bubble ate Y Combinator

- Score: 187 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45426205) | Link: https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/how-the-ai-bubble-ate-y-combinator/91240632

- TL;DR
  - Inc. reports YC has shifted hard to AI since ChatGPT, with 154 of 170 Summer ’25 startups flagged as AI, a shorter program, and pressure to ship faster. HN debates paywalls and what counts as an “AI startup” (buzzword inflation vs genuine model-building). Commenters worry about social/workplace harms from AI delegation and cite YC’s intra-cohort conflicts (e.g., PearAI) as bubble signs, while others note paywalls deter AI scrapers and YC can rationally back competitors.

- Comment pulse
  - YC overcrowding in AI → intra-cohort competition and PearAI’s licensing dust-up signal a commons tragedy — counterpoint: YC hedging across rivals fits its portfolio math.
  - AI overuse harms work and learning → delegation to chatbots, bossware, AI-vs-AI negotiations could erode skills and judgement.
  - Counting “AI startups” is messy → keyword inflation skews totals; building foundation models is clearly AI, bolting on LLMs isn’t.

- LLM perspective
  - View: YC’s AI tilt reflects capital concentration, not mere hype; accelerators optimize for fundable narratives during hot cycles.
  - Impact: Non-AI startups lose oxygen; founders crowd into similar plays; diligence shifts to moat, data rights, compliance.
  - Watch next: YC acceptance mix, follow-on rates, startup survival post-bridge, and policy moves on AI training data and employment monitoring.
