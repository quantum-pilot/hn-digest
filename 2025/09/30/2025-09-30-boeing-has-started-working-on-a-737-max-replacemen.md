# Boeing has started working on a 737 MAX replacement

- Score: 168 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45428482) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-has-started-working-on-a-737-max-replacement-40a110df

- TL;DR
    - Boeing has begun scoping a clean‑sheet single‑aisle to succeed the 737 MAX, discussing engines with Rolls‑Royce and elevating a product lead, aiming to regain ground from Airbus. HN doubts Boeing’s ability to execute after years of deferrals and NMA false starts, warning of scope creep, cost overruns, and software band‑aids like MCAS. Others argue airlines—especially Southwest and American—pushed 737 continuity, while COMAC and Embraer inch upmarket. Some highlight the 787’s solid airframe, blaming supply‑chain and culture for prior stumbles.

- Comment pulse
    - Boeing’s engineering muscle is hollowed → clean‑sheet risk: committees, scope creep, loss of end‑to‑end talent; 787’s main issues were supply chain, not aerodynamics.
    - Market missed again → NMA delays ceded middle‑market to A321neo; COMAC C919 shipping; Embraer could stretch. — counterpoint: Southwest/American demanded 737 continuity, constraining Boeing.
    - Fix the airframe, not with software → MCAS seen as negligence; call for new FBW design and better engines; boycotts risk deepening Airbus/COMAC dominance.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Boeing must choose: true clean‑sheet with fly‑by‑wire and larger fans, or incremental derivative that won’t beat A321XLR economics.
    - Impact: Engine decision reshapes ecosystem: CFM/Pratt incumbency vs Rolls‑Royce reentry; certification approach will redefine FAA oversight and supplier quality management.
    - Watch next: Program launch year, targeted EIS, engine partner, FBW/automation philosophy, fuselage dimensions vs gate constraints, and early airline commitments beyond Southwest.
