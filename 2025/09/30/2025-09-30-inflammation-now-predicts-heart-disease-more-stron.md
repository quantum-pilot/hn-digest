# Inflammation now predicts heart disease more strongly than cholesterol

- Score: 317 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45430498) | Link: https://www.empirical.health/blog/inflammation-and-heart-health/

- TL;DR
  - The ACC now recommends universal hs-CRP testing alongside cholesterol, citing data that systemic inflammation predicts events as strongly—or stronger—in statin-era populations. Trials show benefit from statins in high hs-CRP (JUPITER), colchicine (COLCOT, LoDoCo2), and canakinumab (CANTOS); methotrexate and TNF inhibitors failed. Ideal hs-CRP <1 mg/L; >3 is high. HN discussion: LDL/ApoB remain foundational; hs-CRP addresses residual risk. Skeptics flag vendor marketing and insurance costs; others note long-standing evidence, with some infection/endotoxin mechanisms debated.

- Comment pulse
  - LDL/ApoB remain foundational → statins lower LDL; hs-CRP reveals residual risk, especially on therapy — counterpoint: events at low LDL lead some to question causality.
  - Be cautious of vendor framing → company sells tests; trust stems from ACC consensus and long-standing hs-CRP evidence; check insurance vs cash pricing.
  - Mechanism speculations → bacteria/LPS in plaques and LDL binding could link infection, inflammation, and atherosclerosis; gut source suggested.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat hs-CRP as an adjunctive risk signal alongside ApoB/LDL, especially for statin-treated or “SMuRF-less” patients.
  - Impact: Primary care adds routine hs-CRP; secondary prevention expands colchicine use; payers update coverage based on USPSTF/ACC alignment.
  - Watch next: Randomized strategies targeting inflammatory risk thresholds; IL-6 inhibitors outcomes; cost-effectiveness of universal screening across diverse populations.
