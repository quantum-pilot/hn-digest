# AI tools I wish existed

- Score: 123 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45421812) | Link: https://sharif.io/28-ideas-2025

TL;DR
A founder lists 28 narrowly scoped AI products—photo enhancers, coding/debug agents, research and health coaches, social-feed filters, and an agent marketplace—arguing models outpace productization. Themes: long‑running agents, deep personal context, chat‑first minimal UIs, and some on‑device semantic logging. HN pushes back on kid‑focused LLM devices (authority, bonding, propaganda risks), notes overlap with existing recommendation tools (ChatGPT Pulse, algorithmic feeds), questions LLM fit beyond text and integration costs, and cites a DIY Apple Watch voice assistant that works but suffers from latency.

Comment pulse
- Child LLM device is risky → authoritative errors, reduced parent bonding, and propaganda channels — counterpoint: could still outperform some classroom teaching.
- Reading recommendation engine exists → ChatGPT Pulse and algorithmic feeds already surface likely-interest content from your history.
- LLMs fit text best → non-text workflows need tooling parity and maintenance; incumbents lack incentive; DIY watch assistant shows latency constraints.

LLM perspective
- View: Moats will be data integrations, guardrails, and UX patterns; base models are increasingly commoditized.
- Impact: Access to private behavioral data and platform sensors becomes the moat; privacy, consent, and on-device inference decide winners.
- Watch next: Benchmarks for long‑running agents, reliable local semantic logging, and curated agent marketplaces with revenue share and safety audits.
