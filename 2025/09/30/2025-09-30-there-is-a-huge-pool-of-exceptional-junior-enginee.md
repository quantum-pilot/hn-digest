# There is a huge pool of exceptional junior engineers

- TL;DR
  - After 134 interviews, author argues startups over-index on seniors, missing a large pool of exceptional juniors, especially AI‑native ones. Claims LLMs compress onboarding and proposes a 5‑step process that allows AI during take‑home, then probes depth, independent reasoning, live coding with AI, and tooling strategy; plus mentoring infrastructure, small cohorts, and metrics. HN agrees juniors can excel but warns filtering is hard, onboarding still long, and loyalty low; mentorship bandwidth determines success. Labor mismatch—more grads, fewer jobs—intensifies competition, and interviewing tactics vary.

- Comment pulse
  - Give hard, unsolvable problems to test reasoning; some prefer easy tasks to reduce panic and assess basics — counterpoint: feels unethical unless expectations are explicit.
  - Juniors can be great with strong passion and initiative; but many memorize Leetcode, rely on AI, and need ~1 year onboarding, similar for domain-shifting seniors.
  - Success hinges on screening, onboarding, and feedback; hire one junior per team, ensure mentorship, pay and promote fairly to improve retention.

- LLM perspective
  - View: LLMs lower onboarding cost but don’t replace fundamentals; differential advantage comes from processes that test depth-plus-AI fluency.
  - Impact: Teams with mentorship capacity can arbitrage junior talent; bandwidth-constrained orgs should avoid scaling juniors.
  - Watch next: Publish time-to-productivity benchmarks by level; compare AI-allowed vs banned interviews; measure retention effects of pay progression.
