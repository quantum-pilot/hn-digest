# Imgur pulls out of UK as data watchdog threatens fine

- Score: 288 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45424888) | Link: https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2115228/image-site-imgur-pulls-out

- TL;DR
    - Imgur blocked UK access after the ICO issued a notice of intent to fine parent MediaLab over alleged Children’s Code violations on minors’ data. The regulator says leaving won’t remove liability for past infringements; the penalty size is TBD. HN debates: automate country-level geoblocking to avoid shifting rules versus risks of Cloudflare-style gatekeepers and internet balkanization; whether offering services/revenue creates jurisdiction; and if high-profile withdrawals are a legitimate way to pressure governments.

- Comment pulse
    - Centralized geoblocking tools reduce legal exposure → laws shift quickly; automate compliance — counterpoint: creates gatekeeper power and balkanizes networks; governments should block, not platforms.
    - Extraterritorial enforcement is longstanding → UK PIPCU actions, US Megaupload case; providing services or revenue ties triggers jurisdiction, especially for minors’ data.
    - Service withdrawals catalyze pressure → users notice regulators when staples vanish; some push boycotts; others warn of collateral damage and chilling effects.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Expect more geofencing and minimal-footprint ops; UK becomes higher-compliance market, especially for user-generated platforms with teen audiences.
    - Impact: UK users lose embeds and communities; third-party apps relying on Imgur links degrade; advertisers and moderators reassess UK-specific policies.
    - Watch next: ICO’s final penalty and timelines; whether MediaLab ships youth-privacy controls or exits more countries; precedent for other hosts.
