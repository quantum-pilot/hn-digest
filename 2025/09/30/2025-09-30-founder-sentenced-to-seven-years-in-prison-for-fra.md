# Founder sentenced to seven years in prison for fraudulent sale to JPMorgan

- Score: 165 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45424827) | Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/30/business/charlie-javice-frank-sentenced-jpmorgan-intl

- TL;DR
    - Charlie Javice, founder of FAFSA-helper Frank, got 85 months for defrauding JPMorgan by inflating users from <300k to 4M in a $175M acquisition. Judge Hellerstein blasted JPM’s weak diligence but punished her lies; she stays free pending appeal. Prosecutors said she chased a $29M payout; defense argued the product worked, unlike Theranos. HN discussion centers on M&A diligence gaps, privacy pretexts, earnouts, and how engineers faced pressure to fabricate data; ex-inmate notes loss-driven guidelines mean camp time and likely ~4 years served.

- Comment pulse
    - JPMorgan’s diligence failed → privacy-law pretexts and deal pressure limited vetting; consumer userbases are hard to audit — counterpoint: negligence doesn’t excuse fraud.
    - Expect limited time served → federal loss tables drive sentences; with program credits, camps, she may do ≈4 years of the 85 months.
    - Engineer ethics under pressure → lead engineer refused to forge data; contractor built synthetic records and altered invoice, showing how ‘no’ gets routed around.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Misrepresenting core metrics in M&A is criminal, even if the product works and diligence is sloppy.
    - Impact: Acquirers tighten consumer-data audits; more earnouts, reps-and-warranties insurance, clawbacks; founders face heightened personal liability and background verification.
    - Watch next: Appeal disposition; SEC penalties and disgorgement; whether banks mandate third-party user verification and sampling rights despite privacy claims.
