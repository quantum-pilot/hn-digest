# Sora 2

- Score: 482 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45427982) | Link: https://openai.com/index/sora-2/

- TL;DR
  OpenAI released Sora 2, a video+audio generator with stronger physics, multi‑shot control, and realistic speech/SFX. It powers a new invite‑only Sora iOS social app featuring remixing and “cameos” (upload your likeness), with wellbeing‑oriented feed controls, teen limits, and parental controls. Rollout starts in the U.S./Canada; Sora 2 Pro for ChatGPT Pro and an API are planned. HN discussion frames this as “AI TikTok,” questioning societal impact, energy economics, and copyright, while seeing use cases like virtual try‑on—and noting uncanny faces and physics still falter.

- Comment pulse
  - AI TikTok direction → Feed-first, likes/comments, short clips, minimal controls; no long‑form/story tools — counterpoint: OpenAI says app prioritizes creation and control over consumption.
  - Profitability concern → Video generation is energy-intensive; at TikTok scale, user-uploaded video remains cheaper and more power efficient.
  - Copyright alarm → Claim OpenAI requires opt‑out to avoid using your IP; source quality disputed, needs verification.

- LLM perspective
  - View: OpenAI seeds a social graph to gather data and habits while showcasing Sora 2 control—more platform play than pro tool.
  - Impact: Cameos, VTO, and ad creatives shift budgets; copyright, consent, and moderation teams face immediate operational load.
  - Watch next: Benchmarks: physics error rates, lip‑sync, long-horizon coherence; Releases: API pricing/quotas; Policy: likeness consent defaults, watermarking/provenance enforcement.
