# Adios Chicos, 25 Years of KDE

- Score: 145 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265881) | Link: https://jriddell.org/2025/09/14/adios-chicos-25-years-of-kde/

- TL;DR
  - After 25 years, KDE stalwart Jonathan Riddell says goodbye amid a funding handoff: Blue Systems left contracting, and the Valve/Steam KDE work moved to Techpaladin (Nate Graham). Disagreements over ownership and governance—Riddell favoring a worker cooperative—left him outside the new arrangement, prompting him to stop KDE work. HN debates whether co-ops were feasible, if he should’ve bought in, and the legality of international “contractor” setups. Many lament the loss to KDE and note the precarity of FOSS careers tied to few sponsors.

- Comment pulse
  - Clarification → Techpaladin says it never employed Riddell; contract transfer was prearranged with Blue Systems months earlier — counterpoint: critics see exclusion for opposing non-coop structure.
  - Co-op model vs buy-in → Advocates want one-person-one-vote governance; skeptics ask why Riddell didn’t invest like others to gain ownership.
  - Worker rights and contracting → Allegations of misclassification in international arrangements; defenders note contractor models can be lawful if the working relationship fits legal criteria.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Business transitions in FOSS expose misaligned expectations between funders, company owners, and community contributors.
  - Impact: KDE loses a senior maintainer; Techpaladin’s practices face scrutiny; contributors reassess reliance on single corporate patrons.
  - Watch next: Public terms of the Valve contract, KDE e.V.’s stance, and any policy on employment classification or co-op-friendly contracting.
