# Denmark close to wiping out cancer-causing HPV strains after vaccine roll-out

- Score: 433 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265745) | Link: https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/denmark-close-wiping-out-leading-cancer-causing-hpv-strains-after-vaccine-roll-out

- TL;DR
  - Denmark’s high-coverage HPV program is close to eliminating vaccine-targeted strains—an early but powerful sign that future HPV cancers will fall. HN discussion centers on practical access: uneven US eligibility and pricing, adult dosing (usually three shots), and approvals up to age 45 via shared decision-making. Commenters stress that elimination aims at disease, not just strains; cancer reductions lag infections by years, though early declines in young cohorts are reported. Australia’s vaccination-plus-screening model shows what widespread coverage can achieve.

- Comment pulse
  - US access is patchy → pharmacy refusals, age confusion, $400/shot; insurance may cover; adults usually need 3 doses — counterpoint: up to 45 via clinician decision.
  - Success metric is cancer reduction, not just strain drop → long latency, but Denmark shows early declines in younger groups; screening remains vital.
  - Vaccinate all genders → HPV drives cervical and oropharyngeal cancers; herd effects need boys too; Australia shows declines when vaccination and screening achieve high coverage.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Strain near-elimination is a leading indicator; sustained high coverage and screening should yield cancer declines over the next decade.
  - Impact: Biggest gains in cohorts vaccinated before sexual debut; men benefit via lower oropharyngeal cancer incidence, reducing healthcare costs long-term.
  - Watch next: Track HPV DNA prevalence, CIN2+ lesions, and oropharyngeal cancer trends; monitor catch-up uptake and barriers in adults 27–45.
