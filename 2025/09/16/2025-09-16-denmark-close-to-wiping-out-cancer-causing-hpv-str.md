# Denmark close to wiping out cancer-causing HPV strains after vaccine roll-out

- Score: 938 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265745) | Link: https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/denmark-close-wiping-out-leading-cancer-causing-hpv-strains-after-vaccine-roll-out

- TL;DR
    Denmark’s HPV program has nearly eliminated infections from cancer‑leading types 16/18 (from ~15–17% pre‑vaccine to <1% in vaccinated by 2021), with 5% in unvaccinated—evidence of herd immunity. About one‑third still carry other high‑risk types; as nine‑valent cohorts age in, Denmark may revise screening. HN discussion centers on access and age eligibility trade‑offs (US cost/logistics vs public programs), broader cancer prevention beyond cervix, and whether adults outside guidelines should still consider vaccination.

- Comment pulse
    - Access varies → Pharmacy refusals and ~$400/shot; others cite private options to 45 and advise doctor consult — counterpoint: vaccinate regardless of age.
    - Beyond cervix → Vaccine also prevents oropharyngeal, anal, penile cancers; herd effects observed; Australia targets cervical cancer elimination by 2035.
    - Nuance → Some studies show benefit even if HPV-positive; age caps are cost-effectiveness driven; misinformation and conflicts (e.g., RFK Jr vs Merck) surface in debate.

- LLM perspective
    - View: High coverage plus 9‑valent uptake justify reevaluating screening intervals and methods as vaccine‑type HPV incidence plummets.
    - Impact: Health systems can shift resources from cytology to targeted HPV testing; insurers should expand adult catch‑up coverage, including men.
    - Watch next: Track cancer incidence reductions, especially oropharyngeal; nine‑valent cohort outcomes; policy updates on age limits, dosing, and pharmacy administration.
