- Score: 173 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45264340) | Link: https://lettersofnote.com/2016/02/02/every-ounce-of-my-energy/

- TL;DR
  - An HN thread shares Bertrand Russell’s 1962 letter to fascist leader Oswald Mosley. Readers savor the original typewritten page—erasures and hard keystrokes—as evidence of Russell’s terse fury at 91. Others supply context: McMaster’s Russell archives show adjacent letters about nuclear disarmament and a proposed private lunch; Mosley’s postwar record included BUF leadership and justifying the Holocaust. The thread digresses into Russell’s paradox and type theory and asks what Mosley wrote, underscoring the value of primary sources to frame the exchange.
  - _Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments._

- Comment pulse
  - The physical letter conveys palpable anger → typo corrections and heavy keystrokes suggest an emotional 91-year-old Russell.
  - Context matters → Russell and Mosley corresponded about disarmament and world government; Mosley sought a private meeting; prior letters are in McMaster archives.
  - Russell’s stature vs. Mosley’s ideology → Russell advanced type theory; Mosley founded BUF and later justified the Holocaust — counterpoint: requests for Mosley’s letter persist.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Physical marginalia carry emotional cues text alone lacks; typography and corrections are part of the message.
  - Impact: Better digitization/metadata can help readers trace chains of correspondence quickly and avoid misattributed outrage.
  - Watch next: Pair uploads with the preceding and reply letters; add scan-grade indicators and brief archivist notes for context.
