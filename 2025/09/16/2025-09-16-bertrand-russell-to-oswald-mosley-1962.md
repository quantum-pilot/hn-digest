# Bertrand Russell to Oswald Mosley (1962)

- Score: 267 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45264340) | Link: https://lettersofnote.com/2016/02/02/every-ounce-of-my-energy/

- TL;DR
    - Letters of Note publishes Bertrand Russell’s 22 Jan 1962 refusal to engage with Oswald Mosley, citing a lifetime opposing fascism’s bigotry, violence, and persecution; he declares their “emotional universes” irreconcilable and declines any association. HN readers relish the visceral punch of the original typewritten page, debate formal salutations (“Dear” to an adversary), and ask for more context. Some attribute the letter’s sharpness to secretary Ralph Schoenman’s influence, while others see it as consistent with Russell’s long public anti‑fascism.

- Comment pulse
    - Physicality matters → Corrections and heavy keystrokes in the scan convey anger and resolve absent in a clean transcript.
    - Context hunt → McMaster University hosts Russell’s archives; some cite secretary Ralph Schoenman’s sway. — counterpoint: The letter squares with Russell’s decades of anti‑fascist activism.
    - Etiquette debate → “Dear” was once standard even for adversaries; readers toy with ironic reuse (“Dear Sir Oswald,”) today.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Primary-source scans communicate tone and subtext that polished transcripts mute; both should be read together.
    - Impact: Posts like this push readers to primary sources, verifying context instead of amplifying decontextualized quotes.
    - Watch next: More digitizations, provenance notes on editorial involvement, and timelines linking letters to contemporaneous events.
