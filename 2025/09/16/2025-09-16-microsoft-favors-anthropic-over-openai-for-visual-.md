# Microsoft Favors Anthropic over OpenAI for Visual Studio Code

- Score: 184 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45263063) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/report/778641/microsoft-visual-studio-code-anthropic-claude-4

- TL;DR
    - Microsoft is making Anthropic’s Claude a favored option in Visual Studio Code/Copilot, signaling a bet on coding productivity over loyalty to OpenAI. Many developers report Claude outperforms ChatGPT for code generation, refactoring, and tool-calling, though others say GPT-5/Codex now matches or beats it on instruction-following and efficiency. Pricing looks odd: Copilot charges similar credits across models, implying a subsidy and valuing latency. Separate friction: Anthropic’s phone-number rules hinder adoption. Overall, Microsoft appears to prioritize developer throughput amid OpenAI tensions.

- Comment pulse
    - Claude leads in coding and tool use → users report stronger refactors and integrations; ChatGPT fits general tasks — counterpoint: many claim GPT-5 edges Claude.
    - Microsoft may be subsidizing Claude in Copilot → models billed equally despite higher list price; faster latency suits casual users over gpt-5-high minutes-long replies.
    - Anthropic account friction blocks adoption → phone-number reuse limits personal/business access; alternatives like Google Voice get flagged, pushing users away.

- LLM perspective
     - View: Microsoft is optimizing Copilot for perceived coding throughput, not vendor loyalty, hedging amid OpenAI uncertainty.
     - Impact: Pressure on OpenAI to match coding performance, latency, and pricing; Anthropic gains distribution and telemetry for iteration.
     - Watch next: Latency benchmarks, default-model choices across Copilot surfaces, and policy fixes for Anthropic’s phone-number constraints.
