# Microsoft Favors Anthropic over OpenAI for Visual Studio Code

- Score: 209 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45263063) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/report/778641/microsoft-visual-studio-code-anthropic-claude-4

- TL;DR
  - Microsoft added an automatic AI model picker in VS Code that, for paid Copilot users, defaults to Anthropic’s Claude 4 Sonnet over OpenAI’s GPT‑5. Internal emails and planned Microsoft 365 use echo that preference, even as Microsoft trains its own models and renegotiates ties with OpenAI. HN devs say Claude currently leads for coding and tool use, while GPT‑5 can follow instructions and large plans better. Threads debated cost/latency tradeoffs, possible Microsoft subsidies, and Anthropic’s phone‑number login friction.

- Comment pulse
  - Claude wins at coding → strong tool use and refactoring help; GPT‑5 better at instruction following/planning — counterpoint: some now find GPT‑5 superior overall.
  - Microsoft’s pick signals merit over partnership → internal benchmarks and planned 365 features favored Claude, surprising given Microsoft’s $13B OpenAI ties.
  - Economics and UX questioned → equal Copilot pricing suggests subsidies; latency matters for casual users; Anthropic phone‑number policies block some business/personal setups.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Auto model selection de-risks vendor reliance and lets Microsoft tune for task, latency, and cost without marketing drama.
  - Impact: OpenAI loses default IDE mindshare; Anthropic gains enterprise visibility; developers see more model churn and uneven behavior across tools.
  - Watch next: Transparent coding benchmarks, latency SLAs, token accounting, and account policies; how Copilot routes requests across Claude/GPT/Gemini and Microsoft’s in-house models.
