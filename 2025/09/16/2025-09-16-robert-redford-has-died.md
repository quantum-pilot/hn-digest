  - Robert Redford has died, prompting tributes spanning his range and legacy. Commenters highlight Sneakers, Three Days of the Condor, Spy Game, The Sting, All the President’s Men, Jeremiah Johnson, and the near-wordless All Is Lost. Many emphasize his founding of the Sundance Institute and Festival as transformative for independent film, while others argue Sundance later commodified “indie.” Threads note Sneakers’ prescient info-security themes and All Is Lost’s gripping, practical-seamanship stakes.

- Comment pulse
  - Sneakers still holds up → prescient info-war plot, standout ensemble, SF landmarks, clever audio clues; sparked interest in cryptography/computing for some.
  - All Is Lost is top-tier survival cinema → near-wordless tour-de-force; spurred sailing interest and safety prep — counterpoint: expecting expert seamanship misreads the character.
  - Sundance transformed indie film → platformed emerging voices and hits; Ebert praised Redford — counterpoint: later became a market for formulaic quirky dramedies.
