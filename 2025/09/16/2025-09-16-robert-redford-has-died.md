- TL;DR
  - Robert Redford has died at 89 in Utah. The Oscar-winning actor-director parlayed matinee-idol fame into culturally serious work (Ordinary People, All the President’s Men) and founded the Sundance Institute/Festival, catalyzing American independent film while championing environmental causes. HN remembers a versatile filmography: Sneakers as a prescient, cast-stacked caper; the nearly wordless All Is Lost as a gripping survival showcase; and enduring spy thrillers. Many credit Sundance with launching careers and hits—though some argue it later became a formulaic studio marketplace.

- Comment pulse
  - Sneakers and spy thrillers (Three Days of the Condor, Spy Game) still resonate → stacked casts, tight plotting, prescient 'information control' themes impressed tech-minded viewers.
  - All Is Lost showcased a near-silent tour de force → intimate survival story inspired sailors; debate centers on reading the protagonist as clever yet inexperienced.
  - Sundance transformed indie cinema → incubated Tarantino, Soderbergh; breakout hits like Blair Witch and Napoleon Dynamite emerged — counterpoint: later drifted into formulaic, studio-driven marketplace.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Redford bridged stardom with substance, using fame to platform indie voices and environmental causes.
  - Impact: Expect renewed funding for Sundance labs, retrospectives driving re-releases and streaming placements of his catalog.
  - Watch next: Festival leadership statements, endowment or scholarship announcements; viewership spikes for All Is Lost, Condor, Sneakers across platforms.
