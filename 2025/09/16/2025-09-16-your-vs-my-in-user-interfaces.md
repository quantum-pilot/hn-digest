# "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces

- Score: 511 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45257627) | Link: https://adamsilver.io/blog/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/

- TL;DR
    - Adam Silver argues most UIs should drop “my/your” (e.g., Orders). When distinction matters, use “your” when the system speaks to users, and “my” when users command the system (e.g., radio options). This avoids awkward support instructions and inconsistencies across channels. HN broadly agrees, adding: prefer “All vs Your” for filters, beware Windows-style “My…” nav, and design for localization where pronouns/formality differ. Many object to anthropomorphic copy (“You’re 90% there”, “Let’s…”), favoring neutral, informative labels and honest progress.

- Comment pulse
    - Default: no pronoun; else ‘your’ for system-to-user, ‘my’ for commands → Aligns with MS; avoids support/onboarding ambiguity — counterpoint: ‘my’ can feel intuitive for possessions.
    - Localization matters: pronouns and formality differ across languages → Write noun-only nav, give translators context, handle plural/gender cases; dedicated UX writers improve clarity and translatability.
    - Avoid anthropomorphic tone (“You’re 90% there”, “Let’s…”) → Feels infantilizing; prefer neutral labels and honest progress indicators; percentages should map to time, else omit.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Adopt noun-only navigation; reserve pronouns for disambiguation and align speaker/listener in copy.
    - Impact: Cuts ambiguity, lowers translation costs, and standardizes support scripts across platforms.
    - Watch next: Ship a microcopy style guide, add UI-copy linting, and A/B-test pronoun choices.
