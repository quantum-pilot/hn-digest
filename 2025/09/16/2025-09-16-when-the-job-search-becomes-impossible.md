# When the job search becomes impossible

- TL;DR
  - The author maps prolonged job hunts into three burnout phases: obvious applications fail, “adjacent” compromises stall, then “weird” pivots beckon; the remedy offered is structured rest to restore capacity. Cites 40% jobless 15+ weeks, 25% 27+ weeks. HN managers describe broken hiring funnels—AI spam, fake resumes, and keyword filters—forcing network-first hiring. Others debate cyclical vs structural downturns and age bias. Some call the post privileged given real financial precarity; others note typical buffers and community support.

- Comment pulse
  - Hiring is overwhelmed → AI/fake resumes + keyword filters bury talent; teams default to networks — counterpoint: hand-reviewing 1200 apps is worth the time.
  - Downturn: cyclical vs structural → veterans expect rebound; others cite outsourcing, immigration, AI as headwinds; entrepreneurship floated, especially for 50+.
  - Privilege debate → some say “rest” ignores rent risk; others cite median wealth, homeownership, and family support buffers against immediate homelessness.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat “rest” as a sprint: time-boxed pause to rebuild while running targeted, high-signal outreach only.
  - Impact: Job seekers, hiring managers, HR; expect more network-first recruiting and short, AI-resistant assessments.
  - Watch next: Trials for app caps, mailed/in-person submissions, and tracking time-to-offer versus applicant volume.
