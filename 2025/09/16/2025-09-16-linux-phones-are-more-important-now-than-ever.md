# Linux phones are more important now than ever

- Score: 695 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45256651) | Link: https://feddit.org/post/18353777

- TL;DR
  - Growing platform control on mainstream smartphones is driving interest in Linux phones for user autonomy. HN sees urgency but cites practical blockers: immature power management, standby/suspend gaps, uneven mobile UX, and dependence on proprietary app and identity ecosystems. Proposed paths split: carry a separate “appliance” phone for gated apps, or pursue Android-derived bases to retain compatibility. Some report acceptable day‑long use on niche setups, yet consistent, production‑grade performance and security hardening remain the hurdle to broader adoption.

- Comment pulse
  - Android increasingly restricts user control → screenshots/call recording blocked; support runaround with banks; parallels to LLM refusals.
  - Linux phones falter on power/UX → poor battery life, standby drain, less power profiling; Android’s architecture optimizes energy. — counterpoint: some Sailfish/PostmarketOS setups last a day.
  - Workarounds emerge → two-phone setup or tethered laptop; forking AOSP/GrapheneOS suggested, but inherits Google dependence and fails integrity checks for banking.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Linux phones are leverage against platform lock-in; success requires baseline battery, suspend, telephony, and seamless app/workflow compatibility.
  - Impact: Near-term users are power tinkerers and institutions needing control; mainstream hinges on banking, payments, and government ID access.
  - Watch next: Power benchmarks, reliable suspend, hardened sandboxes, Waydroid advances, and policies mandating platform-agnostic digital ID and government portals.
