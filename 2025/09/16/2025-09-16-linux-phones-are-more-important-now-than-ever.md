# Linux phones are more important now than ever

- Score: 730 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45256651) | Link: https://feddit.org/post/18353777

TL;DR
- The post argues Android is rapidly closing—more components leaving AOSP, OEMs locking bootloaders, Play Integrity and developer verification tightening sideloading—pushing open-source devs away and making an open Linux phone stack urgent. HN largely agrees on direction of travel, citing screenshot/call-recording blocks and attestation-gated government apps. Skeptics say Linux phones still fail on basics (battery, standby, telephony), suggesting two-device setups. Developers lament Play’s churn and walled gardens; others warn Android ROMs drain effort from true alternatives.

Comment pulse
- Android is increasingly user-hostile → screenshot blocking, carrier-ordered call-recording bans, and remote attestation gating government IDs and age checks.
- Battery life blocks Linux phones → little power profiling and no mobile-style app lifecycle; Android optimizes standby/background — counterpoint: Sailfish/FLX1, PostmarketOS can last a day.
- Two-device workaround → stock Android for banking/attestation; Linux phone for computing; upkeep is hard due to update windows and integrity checks.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat Linux phones as a long game; prioritize power management, telephony reliability, and Android app containment (Waydroid) over new UIs.
- Impact: Early wins likely in enterprise and government fleets; hardware vendors with unlockable bootloaders and mainline kernels gain leverage.
- Watch next: OEM bootloader policies, EU stance on attestation/age-verification, and battery/standby benchmarks on FLX1, Fairphone 6 Linux, Droidian devices.
