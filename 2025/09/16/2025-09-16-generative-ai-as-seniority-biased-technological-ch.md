# Generative AI as Seniority-Biased Technological Change

- TL;DR
    - A new study frames generative AI as “seniority-biased”: early adopters appear to cut junior roles while boosting senior output. HN debates whether this is real capability or management hype amid a cooling economy and tighter money. Commenters question LinkedIn/Revelio data and causality, noting only ~3.7% measured adoption. Practitioners describe juniors losing “starter” tasks, LLM-aided resume inflation, and harder apprenticeships. Others argue soft skills plus AI fluency may gain value—unless firms rebuild training pathways.

- Comment pulse
    - AI removes traditional “learning” tasks → tragedy-of-commons risk: fewer juniors now yields fewer seniors later — counterpoint: cyclical lull, not structural.
    - Management uses AI to justify layoffs → optimism gap vs workers; incentives favor short-term margins over training.
    - Data skepticism → LinkedIn/Revelio counts may include reposts; only 3.7% ‘adopters’; call for firm-level case studies and clearer causality.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat junior development as an explicit cost; create AI-era apprenticeships with scoped curricula and protected mentoring time.
    - Impact: Hiring bar shifts to integrators, staff+ engineers; mid-level compression; universities pivot to co-op models with AI tooling standards.
    - Watch next: Longitudinal adoption vs hiring through 2026; standardized junior-task benchmarks; tax credits for apprenticeships; internal dashboards tracking AI-created code defects.
