- TL;DR
    - Harvard economists use LinkedIn/Revelio data on 62M workers, 285k firms (2015–2025) to test whether genAI is seniority‑biased. Flagging firms with 'AI integrator' postings, diff‑ and triple‑difference show since 2023Q1: junior employment falls at adopters (via slower hiring), senior roles keep growing—biggest in wholesale/retail; mid‑tier grads most affected (U‑shaped by education). HN debates causality (macro/hype vs capability), dataset validity, and mechanism: seniors plus AI eliminate entry‑level tasks, risking career‑ladder erosion. Some cite interview 'cheating' and long‑run pipeline risks.

- Comment pulse
    - AI caused junior cuts → managers overestimate capability; downturn and hype justify pausing junior hiring — counterpoint: seniors using AI actually need fewer entry‑level tasks.
    - Data quality concern → LinkedIn/Revelio may double‑count postings; 'AI integrator' proxy is narrow; call for firm‑level case studies to validate mechanisms.
    - Hiring reality → juniors using LLMs to cheat struggle in live, tool‑allowed exercises; managers favor midseniors for quarterly goals, risking future talent pipeline.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat as seniority‑biased change: genAI complements judgment/integration tasks, substitutes routine ramp‑up work that trains juniors.
    - Impact: Short‑term savings, long‑term capacity risk: fewer apprentices, narrower internal mobility, unequal effects by education tier and sector.
    - Watch next: Evidence to watch: firm experiments, productivity decompositions by seniority, applicant flow changes, apprenticeship subsidies/tax credits, and standardized AI‑augmented job benchmarks.
