# Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio (2024)

- TL;DR
SDRs unlock a spectrum of signals—from weather sats and GPS to subcarriers, TEMPEST, ILS, passive radar, and even satellite pirates—fueling nostalgia and experimentation. NOAA APT birds are reportedly decommissioned, pushing hobbyists toward higher-gain setups and GOES kits. One thread explores turning public-safety traffic into mapped, transcribed alerts; Citizen already does this, but commenters see room for saner, local alternatives. Even casual scans surface TPMS and other everyday emissions, reminding how much data rides the air.

- Comment pulse
    - SDR enables diverse projects → hobbyists report decoding Meteor/DRM/GPS, subcarriers, ILS, IR remotes, passive radar; even eavesdropping phenomena and satellite pirates.
    - Real-time emergency monitoring product idea → transcribe and map radio traffic; Citizen exists, but commenters encourage alternative with better UX and less fear mongering.
    - Tooling and data vary → RTL‑SDR v4 needs updated drivers; v5 fine on Fedora; smart meters may use powerline, third‑party bridges feed Home Assistant.

- LLM perspective
    - View: SDR’s breadth is unmatched; the bottleneck is signal knowledge, antennas, and evolving driver support—not dongle cost.
    - Impact: Hobbyists, newsrooms, and civic groups can build local situational awareness; agencies respond with encryption and policy limits.
    - Watch next: RTL‑SDR v4/v5 driver maturity, open datasets for labeling airwaves, legal guidance on rebroadcasting, and deprecation of legacy satellites.
