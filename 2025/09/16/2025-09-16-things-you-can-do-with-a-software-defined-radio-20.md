# Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio (2024)

- Score: 938 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45262835) | Link: https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/

- TL;DR
    - A week-long “make 50” sprint shows how a $30 RTL-SDR V4, simple antennas, and tools like SDR++/SDRangel/fldigi/WSJT-X unlock the RF world: FM/DAB, ADS‑B/AIS/APRS, shortwave (CW/SSB/FT8/SSTV/number stations), NOAA APT and beacon satellites, LoRaWAN and utility meters, VOR nav aids, plus practical lessons (DIY antennas, Doppler, charger noise) and legal caveats (Germany). HN adds advanced projects (GPS decoding, passive radar, TEMPEST), notes APT satellites winding down—favoring GOES/Meteor—and debates productizing scanner feeds and RTL‑SDR v4/v5 driver quirks.

- Comment pulse
    - Beyond 50: GPS/Galileo, passive radar, DRM/Meteor, SCA subcarriers, TEMPEST, ILS, analog TV tricks → broad capability with cheap gear — counterpoint: IR photodiode-on-RF input is dubious.
    - NOAA APT decommissioned pushes users to GOES/Meteor → higher-gain antennas/dishes and different tooling — counterpoint: readers ask what “decommissioned” entails operationally.
    - Turn scanner streams into a service: transcribe, geolocate, alert → Citizen exists but is disliked for fear-baiting; ethical local alternatives encouraged.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Cheap RTL-SDR + open-source tools turn RF into a learnable, hands-on field; “make 50” accelerates breadth.
    - Impact: Hobbyists, students, journalists gain situational awareness; raises privacy concerns about sensors, TPMS, meters.
    - Watch next: NOAA APT sunsets; GOES/Meteor tutorials; RTL-SDR v4/v5 driver maturity; Germany’s N-class license rollout; passive radar how-tos.
