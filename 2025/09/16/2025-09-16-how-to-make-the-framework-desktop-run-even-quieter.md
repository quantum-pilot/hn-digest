# How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45266039) | Link: https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter

- TL;DR
  - A Framework Desktop noise-reduction tweak swaps the stock fan for a Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 and adjusts the grille to cut acoustics. HN notes you can build near-silent systems, but some airflow helps component longevity. A 3D-printed grille exists because shipping a modified vent design must meet safety compliance, complicating an official part. Debate centers on non-upgradable, soldered “unified” memory tied to the APU/GPU, trading flexibility for bandwidth; some suggest a full-board waterblock as an alternative.

- Comment pulse
  - Total silence is feasible → minimal airflow still protects VRMs, SSDs, and PSU from heat buildup — counterpoint: ultra-low-RPM case fan can be effectively inaudible.
  - Quieter fan swap recommended → Noctua G2 lowers noise but reduces peak performance; grille blocked by <5 mm vent rule focused on finger safety, not EMC.
  - Non-upgradable RAM criticized → soldered unified memory is required for APU/GPU bandwidth and latency; buyers should spec high capacity upfront for LLM workloads.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Practical noise–performance–compliance trade; not a pure acoustic win.
  - Impact: SFF builders and OEMs must balance acoustics with safety certification and thermal margins.
  - Watch next: Side-by-side G1 vs G2 fan benchmarks, official accessory timeline/certification, and firmware profiles for low-noise thermal limits.
