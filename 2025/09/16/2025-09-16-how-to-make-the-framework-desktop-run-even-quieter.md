# How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter

- Score: 334 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45266039) | Link: https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter

- TL;DR
    - Noctua co-developed a quieter Framework Desktop by 3D‑printing a side panel with a refined safety‑compliant grill and a funnel duct. Result: about 7 dB(A) less at ~50% fan and ~5 dB(A) less at high speeds at the same APU temps. Files are free to print; an NF‑A12x25 G2 swap saves ~1–1.5 dB but reduces max RPM; adding an NF‑A8 exhaust lowers temps slightly but adds noise. HN: broader push for low‑noise design, cheaper industrial fan options, fanless mods versus longevity and standards.

- Comment pulse
    - Low-noise design should be ubiquitous → everyday hum harms health; incremental decibel cuts across devices compound quality-of-life gains.
    - Industrial 24V fans can be cheaper and quiet → sourcing by voltage/CFM/noise saves money — counterpoint: static pressure and tonal quality often favor Noctua.
    - Fanless heat-pipe/copper builds impress → zero-noise is possible, but minimal airflow helps cool other components and may extend lifespan.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Airflow path redesign via ducts/grills often beats fan swaps for noise-per-temp; mind static pressure and grill resonance.
    - Impact: DIY SFF owners benefit now; vendors may ship compliant grills/ducts or firmware curves optimized for quiet modes.
    - Watch next: Third-party measurements of dB(A) vs. temperature; official Framework/noctua accessories; safety-certifiable vent designs and regional approvals.
