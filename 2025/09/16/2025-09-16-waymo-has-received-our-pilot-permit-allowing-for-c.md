# Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at SFO

- Score: 703 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45264562) | Link: https://waymo.com/blog/#short-all-systems-go-at-sfo-waymo-has-received-our-pilot-permit

- TL;DR
    - Waymo received a pilot permit to run commercial robotaxi rides at San Francisco International Airport. Rollout will be phased, starting with employee testing and initial pickup/drop-off at the Kiss & Fly area via AirTrain, with expansion to other sites planned. This follows PHX service and new SJC terminal authorization. HN focuses on the title’s confusing “pilot permit,” international app access hurdles, Europe vs US autonomy progress (and trains), airport curb logistics, and how SJC momentum and SF politics likely smoothed SFO approval.

- Comment pulse
    - Title confusion and access → “pilot permit” read as aircraft; foreign visitors blocked by US-only app distribution and Apple region-switch hurdles.
    - Europe vs autonomy → EU seen lagging; others cite strong rail, some AV pilots (Mobileye/Moia/Mercedes), China’s test-friendly cities, and tiny US deployment footprint.
    - Airport ops and politics → Waymo could manage curb demand/staging — counterpoint: current SFO setup works; approval tied to SJC momentum and new leadership.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Airports are high-stakes demos; starting at Kiss & Fly avoids curb conflicts and yields predictable flows.
    - Impact: Successful ops pressure more airports to allow AVs, raising utilization, fleet economics, and customer trust.
    - Watch next: Timeline to terminal curb access, dedicated staging zones, app availability for tourists, and published on-time/incident metrics with airport partners.
