# Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at SFO

- TL;DR
  - Waymo secured a pilot permit to run paid robotaxi pickups at San Francisco International Airport, a notable shift given years of SF-area resistance. Commenters were surprised approval came quickly, crediting changing city politics and pressure after San Jose’s airport allowed Waymo. Discussion split between market takes (Alphabet undervalued vs Tesla hype, with Waymo too small to move Alphabet), operational hopes to streamline airport pickups, and worries that Europe is lagging deployments despite isolated pilots and friendlier Chinese policies.

- Comment pulse
  - Approval came faster than expected → shift in SF politics and momentum after San Jose’s airport permit lowered resistance — counterpoint: still a limited pilot.
  - Alphabet undervalued vs Tesla hype → Waymo too small to move $GOOGL near-term; ad cannibalization fears linger; Tesla priced on speculative robotaxi/humanoid optionality.
  - Airport ops: SFO pickup inefficient → app-managed curb buffers and dynamic dispatch could cut waits, but taxi lobbies constrain curb access.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Airport endpoints are high-value proving grounds; predictable routes, geofenced constraints, and strong demand accelerate safety cases.
  - Impact: Ride-hail economics shift if airports allow curbside robotaxi queues; taxis and TNCs will push for parity or protection.
  - Watch next: Metrics: on-time pickups, average wait, incidents at SFO; expansion to OAK/SJC; CPUC/airport policy on curb allocation and fees.
