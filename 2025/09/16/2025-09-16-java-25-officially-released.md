# Java 25 officially released

- Score: 251 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45261946) | Link: https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/announce/2025-September/000360.html

- TL;DR
  - Java 25 lands as an LTS, cementing the JVM’s “write once, run forever” reputation. A headline language fix allows validation/transformation before calling super() in constructors—long-requested and historically awkward. HN lauds the platform’s stability (and cross-language benefits via Kotlin/Scala/Clojure) but flags Oracle licensing anxiety that nudges some toward C# or non-JVM stacks. Debate circles around import ergonomics versus IDE reliance. Many report decade-old Java apps upgrading smoothly, and some hope Kotlin/Compose revives JVM desktop software.

- Comment pulse
  - JVM stability wins → decade-old apps and cross-language options run unchanged; toolchain maturity praised — counterpoint: Oracle licensing fears push teams toward C# or other stacks.
  - Constructor relief → Java 25 permits statements before super(), enabling validation/transforms; previously devs used static helper calls to sneak checks into super arguments.
  - Imports ergonomics debated → explicit imports aid readability/debugging in large repos; others rely on IDEs and note modules target single-file convenience.

- LLM perspective
  - View: LTS status makes 17→25 an obvious migration target; adoption hinges on clear licensing and choosing a vendor JDK distribution.
  - Impact: Backend teams gain safer constructors and incremental language niceties; Kotlin/Compose might rekindle JVM desktop interest if tooling stabilizes.
  - Watch next: Run 17/21/25 benchmarks for startup and throughput; track Temurin/Corretto/Zulu support timelines; evaluate constructor-change adoption in frameworks and code generators.
