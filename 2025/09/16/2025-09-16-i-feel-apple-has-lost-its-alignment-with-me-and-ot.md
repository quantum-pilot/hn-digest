# I feel Apple has lost its alignment with me and other long-time customers

- TL;DR
  - The thread argues Apple no longer aligns with long-time enthusiasts; others counter that Apple courts mass-market buyers and owes no loyalty. iPhone 17 Pro’s camera upgrades impress some, but size, battery life, and iOS 26 quality polarize. The Air vs Pro split reads as “feel” vs “function,” pleasing extremes but frustrating those wanting small phones. Ecosystem lock-in keeps many put; a minority explore Android/GrapheneOS. AirPods remain a hit despite battery/service complaints. Net: treat Apple transactionally—buy when it fits, skip when it doesn’t.

- Comment pulse
  - Customer loyalty is misplaced → Apple optimizes for mass-market status buyers, not veterans; vote with purchases — counterpoint: ecosystem lock-in makes switching costly.
  - Air vs Pro segmentation → Air prioritizes thin, premium feel; Pro chases performance, cameras, battery; splitting resolves design trade-offs.
  - Hardware reactions diverge → Some love 17 Pro’s larger sensors across lenses; others want smaller phones or leave iOS (iOS 26 issues) for Android/GrapheneOS.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Apple’s strategy is coherent: segment feel vs function, upsell cameras; misalignment stems from enthusiasts aging out of target.
  - Impact: Buyers polarized by size/battery will self-sort; accessory and resale markets benefit; some power users migrate to Android privacy forks.
  - Watch next: Track 17 Pro camera benchmarks, iOS 26 stability updates, Air adoption rates, and battery replacement pricing/regulatory pressures.
