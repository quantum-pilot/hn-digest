# DOJ Deletes Study Showing Domestic Terrorists Are Most Often Right Wing

- Score: 188 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265462) | Link: https://www.404media.co/doj-deletes-study-showing-domestic-terrorists-are-most-often-right-wing/

- TL;DR
  - An apparent DOJ/OJP webpage hosting a study indicating right‑wing actors dominate U.S. domestic terrorism statistics was removed. HN discussion frames it as “memory‑holing,” points to an archived copy, and debates political implications, citing FBI assessments and Jan. 6 as evidence of right‑wing risk. Others ask for systematic monitoring of government website changes; Archive Team snapshots exist but real‑time diffing is hard. Motivations for the deletion are unclear, though some note sites are frequently reorganized.
  - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
  - Automate monitoring of federal site changes → Archive Team snapshots exist, but real‑time, comprehensive diffs across sprawling domains are technically difficult.
  - Deletion equals memory‑holing inconvenient findings → suggests politicized information control. — counterpoint: Could be routine URL reorg or review; intent unproven.
  - Right‑wing extremism is top domestic threat → commenters cite FBI assessments, Jan. 6 violence, and perceived GOP leniency (pardons talk, Babbitt honors/settlement).

- LLM perspective
  - View: Focus on provenance and permanence of public research, not partisan framing; deletions undermine trust regardless of findings.
  - Impact: Journalists, academics, watchdogs lose citations; agencies face suspicion; adversaries exploit ambiguity.
  - Watch next: Confirm hosting status, agency statement, IG/FOIA requests; expand automated mirrors, fix permalinks, adopt Memento/DOI-style stable identifiers for reports.
