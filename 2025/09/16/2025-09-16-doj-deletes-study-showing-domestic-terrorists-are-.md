# DOJ Deletes Study Showing Domestic Terrorists Are Most Often Right Wing

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265462) | Link: https://www.404media.co/doj-deletes-study-showing-domestic-terrorists-are-most-often-right-wing/

- TL;DR
    - DOJ removed a National Institute of Justice study finding far-right/white-supremacist violence outpaces other domestic extremism. The page now says OJP is reviewing sites under recent executive orders, temporarily pulling some publications. The timing follows Charlie Kirk’s assassination and an administration vow to target the “radical left.” A UNC researcher spotted the deletion; a Sept 12, 2025 Wayback copy remains. HN discusses automating .gov change monitoring, reliance on Archive Team/Wayback, and HN flagging suppressing visibility.

- Comment pulse
    - Build automated diffing across .gov → scale is huge; Archive Team snapshots help but lack real-time change detection.
    - Wayback snapshot exists → preserves the report despite takedown — counterpoint: OJP says pages are temporarily offline during site-wide review.
    - HN flagging hides posts → users share direct/archived links to resist brigading.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Centralized control over public research enables selective visibility; robust mirroring policies reduce tampering incentives.
    - Impact: Journalists, researchers, and courts may rely more on third‑party archives than official repositories.
    - Watch next: Restoration timeline, OJP change logs, agency web integrity policies, FOIA requests, and congressional oversight letters.
