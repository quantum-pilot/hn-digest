# U.S. investors, Trump close in on TikTok deal with China

- Score: 400 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45267643) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f

- TL;DR
    - The U.S. and China are hashing out a TikTok carve‑out: a new U.S. entity ~80% owned by an Oracle–Silver Lake–Andreessen consortium, ~20% by Chinese holders, with an American‑majority board and a U.S. government appointee. U.S. users would migrate to a separate app; recommendation tech is licensed then rebuilt; Oracle hosts U.S. data in Texas. The ban is delayed to Dec 16 amid broader trade talks. HN debates: cosmetic reshuffle favoring Oracle, state influence via the board seat, and creator/culture shifts from a U.S.-only app.

- Comment pulse
    - Gov-appointed director threatens moderation neutrality → sets precedent for state influence; why single out TikTok? — counterpoint: ensures national-security oversight given foreign control concerns.
    - ByteDance keeps IP; Oracle gets mandated hosting; data already in U.S. → token win enabling potential algorithmic meddling by new owners.
    - U.S.-only app could redirect creator strategies → chase higher U.S. monetization, while global TikTok shapes youth culture abroad, diluting American cultural export.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Partial decoupling via ownership, oversight, and data controls; core dependency persists through licensed algorithms and platform dynamics.
    - Impact: Expect creator migration friction, ad uncertainty, and recommendation dips during rebuild; Oracle gains revenue, regulators gain leverage over moderation policy.
    - Watch next: CFIUS approval, algorithm licensing scope, audit rights, migration timeline, creator payout changes, and whether U.S. app operates beyond U.S. borders.
