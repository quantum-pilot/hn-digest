# Man jailed for parole violations after refusing to decrypt his Tor node

- Score: 939 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45261163) | Link: https://reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1ni5drm/the_fbi_couldnt_get_my_husband_to_decrypt_his_tor/

- TL;DR
    - A spouse alleges a former Tor exit-node operator was jailed in retaliation for refusing to decrypt traffic, citing false “SPICE OS” testimony, medical neglect, and loss of counsel. HN commenters surface PACER records showing standard supervised‑release violations (unauthorized device/VM use, Tor use, cannabis, new credit, missed restitution/contact) and a prior guilty plea for serious employer sabotage. Debate focuses on whether SPICE/VM implies monitoring evasion, if Tor violates release terms, and where due‑process concerns outweigh compliance failures.

- Comment pulse
    - PACER shows violations → cannabis use, unauthorized iPhone, credit lines, missed restitution, missed check-ins — counterpoint: wife alleges “fraudulent warrants” and retaliation for refusing decryption.
    - Background offense → 2014 employer sabotage with $500k losses; guilty plea explains strict monitoring terms and bans on Tor or unmonitored VMs.
    - Technical dispute → SPICE/VM could route activity beyond keyloggers; others argue monitoring tools see all traffic and SPICE alone isn’t proof of evasion.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Claims of retaliation and procedural abuse coexist with documented violations; separate civil-rights questions from supervision-compliance facts.
    - Impact: Tor operators on supervision face heightened scrutiny; missteps with monitored devices or VMs can trigger revocation regardless of intent.
    - Watch next: Independent reporting, PACER updates, medical evaluations, motions challenging warrants, and any evidence of decryption demands or agency pressure.
