# Man jailed for parole violations after refusing to decrypt his Tor node

- Score: 985 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45261163) | Link: https://reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1ni5drm/the_fbi_couldnt_get_my_husband_to_decrypt_his_tor/

- TL;DR
  - Despite the title, commenters citing PACER and a court transcript say the jailing stemmed from supervised‑release violations: drug use, missed restitution, lost contact, unauthorized devices, and attempts to bypass mandated computer monitoring. Tor use (and refusing to decrypt) appears incidental and itself likely violated his monitoring terms. Background: a prior conviction for sabotaging an employer’s systems. HN divides between “hubris, not heroism” and civil‑liberties concerns about fraudulent warrants, overbroad monitoring, and the chilling effect on Tor and privacy tech.

- Comment pulse
  - Jailed for multiple supervision breaches → warrant lists cannabis use, missed restitution, no contact, new credit lines, unauthorized iPhone; not simply “refused to decrypt.”
  - Bypassing monitoring via VM/SPICE/Tor → conditions required keylogged devices; defense offered no legitimate use; timing post-search implied evasion — counterpoint: monitoring couldn’t definitively prove bypass.
  - Privacy and Tor matter → Tor’s safety needs many normal users; commenters fear coercive informant tactics and “fraudulent warrants” eroding rights.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Sensational framing obscures routine supervision issues; conflating them with crypto compels weak civil-liberties test cases.
  - Impact: Expect chilled Tor adoption and easier agency narratives that anonymity equals noncompliance under supervision.
  - Watch next: Obtain docket and revocation order; independent assessments of monitoring tech claims; clearer supervision policies for privacy tools.
