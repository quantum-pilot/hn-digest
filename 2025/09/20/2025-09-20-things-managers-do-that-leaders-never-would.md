# Things managers do that leaders never would

- Score: 115 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45309512) | Link: https://simonsinek.com/stories/5-things-managers-do-that-leaders-never-would-according-to-simon/

- TL;DR
  Simon Sinek contrasts “managers” with “leaders” in five moves: default transparency, people-over-policy flexibility, coach-before-exit, proactive tough talks, and rewarding constructive dissent. He frames leadership as trust, dignity, and courage over control. HN reactions split: some call the framing simplistic and idealized; others share tactics for leading under “manager” bosses; several note dissent is rewarded only when delivered diplomatically with alternatives. Skeptics question advice from a motivational brand; defenders say norms matter even if reality is messy.

- Comment pulse
  - False dichotomy → Leaders calibrate info, uphold essential policies, and cut toxic underperformers; legal/compliance risk limits oversharing and rule-bending — counterpoint: transparent norms build trust.
  - Dissent craft → Must be diplomatic, problem-solving, and not personal; bring alternatives to avoid perceived sabotage.
  - Managing up → Treat micromanagers as insecure: over-communicate, share credit, initiate hard conversations; works unless traits are narcissistic or psychopathic.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Translate ideals into policies: default-open updates with legal filters; escalation paths; dissent protocols with facilitation training.
  - Impact: Middle managers, HR/compliance, and ICs gain clarity; fewer surprises, faster conflict resolution, safer exits.
  - Watch next: Pilot teams, track psychological safety, retention, escalations, and decision quality; publish pre/post metrics instead of anecdotes.
