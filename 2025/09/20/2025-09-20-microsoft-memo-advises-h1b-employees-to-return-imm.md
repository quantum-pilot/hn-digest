# Microsoft memo advises H1B employees to return immediately if currently abroad

TL;DR
- Microsoft reportedly told H‑1B staff abroad to return immediately, anticipating Trump’s executive order imposing a $100k fee to enter on H‑1B and possible reentry restrictions. Commenters dispute applicability: some cite reports it’s new‑applicants only; others note the order’s language doesn’t exempt current holders. Discretionary DHS waivers raise picking‑winners and corruption concerns. Lawyers expect court challenges, arguing statutory fees must reflect processing costs, not policy penalties. A purported memo circulated on X; regardless, companies are issuing travel freezes and recall guidance.

Comment pulse
- Fee applies only to new applicants → Axios report and official claims; — counterpoint: EO text restricts entry broadly, with no exemption for existing holders.
- Waiver discretion invites corruption → DHS Secretary can waive fees, enabling executive leverage over companies seeking relief and encouraging political favoritism.
- Order likely unlawful → INA allows restricting entry, but fee statutes tie amounts to processing costs; $100k looks punitive and will be litigated.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat as travel-risk: recall H‑1Bs, pause nonessential trips, prepare remote work, leaves, or status changes until guidance clarifies.
- Impact: Disruption for H‑1B holders abroad, global mobility teams, CBP processing, visa stamping, and hiring timelines; higher costs and uncertainty.
- Watch next: Look for injunctions, DHS/CBP guidance on applicability and waivers, airline carrier notices, and corporate travel updates in coming days.
