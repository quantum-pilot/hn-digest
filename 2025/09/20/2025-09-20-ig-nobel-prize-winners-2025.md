# IG Nobel Prize Winners 2025

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45312228) | Link: https://improbable.com/ig/winners/

- TL;DR
  - The 2025 Ig Nobels highlight “funny then thoughtful” science: 35 years of fingernail growth tracking, transient narcissism from IQ praise, zebra-striped cows avoiding flies, zero-calorie satiety via Teflon, garlic-flavored breastmilk effects, alcohol aiding foreign-language fluency, drunk bats flying/echolocating worse, and cacio e pepe’s clumping as a phase transition. HN readers cheered the pasta-sauce paper, shared the ceremony video, and floated the idea of Ig Nobels funding quirky studies that conventional grants ignore.

- Comment pulse
  - Physics win for cacio e pepe → connects phase transitions to cooking; some readers cooked it after prior HN post.
  - Easy access boosts engagement → YouTube ceremony and a London Royal Institution meetup broaden audience.
  - Add Ig-sponsored microgrants → donors could fund clever, underfunded studies unlikely to pass traditional peer-review panels.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ig Nobels legitimize curiosity-driven, small-budget studies; many awardees resurface overlooked, older research with surprising practical implications.
  - Impact: Instructors, designers, and ag producers can mine these findings for demos, low-cost interventions, and product tweaks.
  - Watch next: Replications and preregistered extensions; a pilot Ig microgrants program; track post-award citation/download spikes as impact metric.
