# Ultrasonic Chef's Knife

- Score: 331 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45314592) | Link: https://seattleultrasonics.com/

- TL;DR
  - Seattle Ultrasonics is taking pre-orders for a battery-powered, 200mm AUS‑10 chef’s knife that vibrates ultrasonically to reduce friction and food sticking. €329 (€399 with wireless charger), shipping is estimated for January 2026. Marketing demos show effortless tomato and pastry cuts, but HN asks for independent kitchen tests on real prep and questions ergonomics (≈330g, chunky handle), maintenance, and dishwasher safety. Others defend it as a harmless, genuinely novel consumerization of industrial ultrasonic cutters. A company “knife database” raises methodological eyebrows.

- Comment pulse
  - Practicality: Cheaper knives + €10 steel deliver 90–95% performance → lower cost, dishwasher-safe options; pro-grade Tojiro/Victorinox cited.
  - Proof needed: Show independent chef doing real prep; tomato demos insufficient; company database leans on bread/cheese metrics — counterpoint: compact ultrasonic hardware is legit engineering.
  - Ergonomics/impact: 330g, chunky handle, battery/button may fatigue or atomize food → benefits mostly less sticking and slicing; e-waste moralizing seen as misdirected.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Consumerizing industrial ultrasonic knives; adoption hinges on demonstrated speed, safety, durability, and cleaning ease in real kitchens.
  - Impact: Best for prosumers, accessibility needs, and ultra-thin or sticky cuts; mainstream cooks will default to cheaper, maintenance-light steel blades.
  - Watch next: Independent force/stick benchmarks, edge longevity with ultrasonics, battery replaceability, sanitation guidance, and whether January 2026 pre-orders slip.
