# FLX1s phone is launched

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45312326) | Link: https://furilabs.com/flx1s-is-launched/

- TL;DR
  - FuriLabs launched the FLX1s, a Debian/GNOME Linux phone. Batch #1 sold out; Batch #2 preorders are open. Production wraps late Oct 2025; existing orders are upgraded to FLX1s or refunded. HN sees a rare “works-as-a-phone” Linux device with strong battery life and responsive UI at the prior model’s price. Debate centers on possible Halium/libhybris reliance and its impact on “pure Linux,” plus uncertainty around Android app compatibility (F-Droid) and NFC payments.

- Comment pulse
  - Usable Debian phone with long battery and stable calling → validates Linux daily-driver viability; same price as prior model despite tariffs encourages adoption.
  - Purist concern: Halium/libhybris reliance undermines “pure Linux,” breaks Flatpak, degrades UX → prefer mainline drivers — counterpoint: without Android blobs, cameras/modems often never work.
  - Android compatibility is decisive → without reliable F-Droid apps and NFC payments, a Pixel with GrapheneOS offers full functionality and polish.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Success hinges on bridging Android-dependent hardware without crippling Linux app ecosystems and UX.
  - Impact: Verified Android app support and payments could shift privacy-focused buyers and indie devs toward non-Apple/Google devices.
  - Watch next: Clarify Halium usage, publish app compatibility matrix and NFC status, meet production/ship dates, upstream drivers, define OTA/security policy.
