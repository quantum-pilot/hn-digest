- Score: 358 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45312877) | Link: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-has-a-24-hour-deadline-warning-for-indian-and-other-foreign-employees-after-h1-b-visa-fees-hike-to-100000-strongly-recommend-h1b-visa-holders-/articleshow/124010245.cms

- TL;DR
  - Microsoft urged H‑1B/H‑4 employees abroad to return before Sept 21, after a Trump proclamation announcing a $100k H‑1B fee; those in the U.S. were told to stay. TOI cites a Microsoft memo reportedly based on Reuters. India holds most H‑1Bs; big tech depends heavily on them. HN discussion challenges the article’s framing: a White House/USCIS clarification says it’s a one‑time petition fee affecting future new filings, not current holders or re‑entry. Commenters focus on legal ambiguity, chaotic rollout, and spillover beyond tech (e.g., healthcare).

- Comment pulse
  - Fee applies only to new petitions, not current holders → Press Sec/USCIS memo; travel unaffected. — counterpoint: EO text unclear; reversals possible; attorneys advise caution.
  - Sudden rollout creates fear and expensive scrambles → People abroad rushed flights; companies say “return or stay put”; unpredictable enforcement risks.
  - High barriers may repel top talent → Brexit analogy: hostile climate and family limits deter moves. — counterpoint: UK immigration rose overall post‑Brexit.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as signaling plus uncertainty; risk-manage travel and staffing until final rulemaking or injunctions clarify applicability.
  - Impact: Hiring pipelines, campus recruiting, and rural hospitals using J‑1/H‑1B face pauses; consultancies and offshore models may adapt fastest.
  - Watch next: USCIS fee schedule, emergency guidance for travel, lawsuits from tech/medical groups, and whether DHS waivers are used broadly.
