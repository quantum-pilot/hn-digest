- Score: 149 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45308628) | Link: https://www.boundless.com/blog/trump-administration-to-propose-new-100000-fee-for-h-1b-visa-applications/

- TL;DR
  - Trump administration reportedly planning a $100,000 fee per H‑1B application and higher prevailing wage rules, framed as protecting U.S. workers and curbing lottery gaming by outsourcers. Critics warn it prices out startups and early‑career talent, nudges hiring offshore, and chills U.S. competitiveness; firms may pivot to O‑1/EB‑1A. Legal challenges are likely since such fees typically require Congress or rulemaking. HN thread offers little debate—mostly merger notices and a link to an attorney Q&A.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A six-figure per-petition fee effectively converts H‑1B into an auction favoring large firms and consultancies.
  - Impact: Startups, universities, hospitals offload roles abroad; higher comp floors raise costs for incumbents and reduce entry-level pipelines.
  - Watch next: Lawsuits on executive authority for fees; DOL wage rule text; company shifts to O‑1/EB‑1A, Canada/U.K. tech visa uptake.
