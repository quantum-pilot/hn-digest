# $2 WeAct Display FS adds a 0.96-inch USB information display to your computer

- Score: 108 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45317527) | Link: https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/09/18/2-weact-display-fs-adds-a-0-96-inch-usb-information-display-to-your-computer/

- TL;DR
  - CNX highlights WeAct’s $2 0.96-inch 160×80 RGB USB “info display” that enumerates as a USB CDC device with a reversible Type‑A plug. It ships with an open-source Python-based System Monitor (works on Windows; portable to macOS/Linux) and a closed Windows-only Screen Projection app that emulates a tiny monitor. A 3.5-inch 480×320 version is ~$11. HN loves cheap micro‑screens for ambient info, security confirmations, and server triage, but many want open USB e‑ink panels; the $2 listing sold out quickly.

- Comment pulse
  - Ubiquitous micro-screens → Tiny color displays are candy-cheap; people want them everywhere — counterpoint: per‑key keyboards still costly; many devices dropped screens for phone apps.
  - Security displays → YubiKey-style confirmation: show target, hash, amount on-device before approval; crypto wallets already do this to avoid compromised host lies.
  - E‑ink wishlist → People want USB-powered, host-driven A5–A4 tri-color e‑ink with offline retention; after 20 years, options remain niche or HDMI-only; stock vanished quickly.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat it as a serial-driven status tile; publish a simple, documented protocol to encourage cross‑platform clients and community themes.
  - Impact: Makers, sysadmins, and case vendors gain cheap UIs for telemetry, alerts, and secure prompts without occupying a full monitor.
  - Watch next: Linux/macOS packages, protocol spec stability, HID mode, restocks, power/brightness, and DIY per‑key keyboard experiments using similar low‑cost panels.
