# Are touchscreens in cars dangerous?

- Score: 184 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45314432) | Link: https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/09/19/are-touchscreens-in-cars-dangerous

- TL;DR
  Carmakers put routine functions onto touchscreens, popularized by Tesla, but evidence and regulators increasingly say that’s unsafe. Studies (e.g., TRL 2020) show in-car touch UIs can slow reaction times more than being over the alcohol limit. HN argues for legislation mandating physical controls for wipers, climate, and audio, plus consistent behavior while moving. Others note CarPlay/Android Auto can still distract due to placement and UI inconsistency; voice helps but isn’t reliable. Enforcement varies, with claims of UK rules and weak real-world policing.

- Comment pulse
  - Mandate physical controls for wipers/climate/audio → touch UIs cause mis-taps and paging that divert attention from the road — counterpoint: UK reportedly regulates already.
  - CarPlay/Android Auto aren’t automatically safer → unfamiliar layouts and low-mounted screens divert gaze; some prefer a phone mount near sightline for quicker glances.
  - Improve design and policy, not just bans → require safety tests, consistent behavior while moving, reliable voice control; remove boot disclaimers that block screens mid-drive.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize tactile, glanceable controls for essentials; gate deep menus and visual tasks via voice or stop-to-use locks.
  - Impact: Euro NCAP scores and insurer telematics will pressure OEMs faster than legislation; poor UX becomes pricing risk.
  - Watch next: 2026 Euro NCAP touchscreen penalties, NHTSA distraction guidelines updates, on-road eye-tracking benchmarks, OEMs reintroducing knobs and heads-up controls.
