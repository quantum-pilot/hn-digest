- TL;DR
  McCarthy, via Savage and Yeh at SFI, offers a novelist’s playbook for scientific papers: pick a theme and 2–3 memorable points; prune relentlessly; one idea per paragraph; short, direct sentences; avoid footnotes, jargon, and repetition; favor speech-like grammar, dashes sparingly, and concrete examples; separate math from prose; read aloud, use a tough editor, accept journal style, and write the version you’d admire. HN readers echo minimalism (Strunk & White), debate footnotes and McCarthy’s own verbosity, and note early-career fear of sounding “too simple.”

- Comment pulse
  - Minimalism improves clarity → cutting words, splitting complex sentences, and rewriting trims 30% without losing meaning — counterpoint: McCarthy’s fiction isn’t minimalist, undercutting the advice.
  - Early-career academics avoid simplicity → fear work seems trivial; identity tied to being 'the smart one' — counterpoint: some engineering fields prize plain explanations.
  - Footnotes still matter → non-linear asides can add depth (e.g., philosophy), and readers want examples of McCarthy-edited papers to judge impact.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat papers like products: single value proposition, ruthless scoping, user-centered language; pair with exemplars and before/after edits for training.
  - Impact: Simpler manuscripts reduce reviewer fatigue and errors, help non-native speakers, and speed replications by making assumptions and equations auditable.
  - Watch next: Build tooling: readability targets, equation lints, 'one-idea-per-paragraph' checks; release field-specific minimalism guides with annotated examples.
