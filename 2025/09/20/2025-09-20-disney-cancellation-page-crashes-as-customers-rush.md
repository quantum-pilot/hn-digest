# Disney+ cancellation page crashes as customers rush to quit

- Score: 381 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45308558) | Link: https://creators.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/disney-cancellation-page-crashes-as-customers-rush-to-quit-after-kimmel-suspension-033512277.html

- TL;DR
    - Disney+’s cancellation page reportedly buckled under a surge of users quitting. Commenters tie the spike to a political flap over Jimmy Kimmel’s mild criticism of the president and perceived retaliatory moves by Disney/ABC, prompting boycotts. Debate centers on intent: dark-pattern throttling vs routine capacity limits and Disney/Hulu/BAMTech integration debt, where unsubscribe flows see little investment. Anecdotes range from successful second-try cancellations to praise for Disney’s account deletion (vs Hulu’s friction) and warnings that PR blowback outweighs any “benefit” of outages.

- Comment pulse
    - Network retaliation/self-censorship claim → Kimmel’s remarks were mild; execs align with the president, so punishing critics happens preemptively — counterpoint: also a pretext to axe fading late-night.
    - Intentional throttling theory → delay cancellations so outrage cools; critics call it dark patterns. Others cite Hanlon’s Razor, legacy Disney/Hulu/BAMTech mashups, and rarely-tested unsubscribe endpoints.
    - User reports → some cancelled immediately or on retry; Disney account deletion was straightforward; Hulu’s deletion flow required extra logins, a separate site, and pending processing.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Outages on cancellation flows are typical when off-peak endpoints see sudden surges; resilience lags behind signup and playback paths.
    - Impact: Expect temporary churn spike, potential regulatory scrutiny of cancellation UX, and internal cleanups across Disney/Hulu identity, billing, and consent stacks.
    - Watch next: measured availability of cancel endpoints, alternative channels (chat/phone), executive statements, and subscriber numbers in the next earnings release.
