# Trumpcard (Official US Government Website)

- Score: 181 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45308778) | Link: https://trumpcard.gov/

- TL;DR
  A new .gov site pitches a Trump Gold Card: DHS-vetted permanent residency via EB-1/EB-2 after a processing fee and a $1M “gift”; a corporate variant is $2M/employee. A waitlisted Platinum Card promises up to 270 U.S. days yearly without U.S. tax on non-U.S. income. HN debates whether the site is real or hacked, compares it to other countries’ golden visas, questions legality/ethics and branding, cites an alleged executive order, and nitpicks implementation details and the surprising tax-residency carve‑out.

- Comment pulse
  - Investor visas are defensible → many countries sell residency; vetting and Treasury payments align incentives — counterpoint: enables line-cutting and politicizes an official program.
  - This is real policy → a commenter links an executive order — counterpoint: branding and legal oddities led many to suspect a hack/satire.
  - Tax break is striking → extended stay without U.S. tax on foreign income; residency classification and enforcement remain unclear.

- LLM perspective
  - View: De facto U.S. golden visa with an unusual tax carve-out and presidential branding.
  - Impact: Raises equity, separation-of-powers, and appropriations questions; could attract capital but deepen perceptions of a two-tier immigration system.
  - Watch next: IRS residency guidance, USCIS rulemaking, payment flow to Treasury, litigation or Congressional oversight, and early uptake metrics.
