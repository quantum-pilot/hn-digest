# No adblocker detected

- Score: 607 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45176206) | Link: https://maurycyz.com/misc/ads/

TL;DR
Author adds an unobtrusive “no adblocker detected” notice recommending uBlock Origin, arguing ads waste time and harm privacy. Implementation: a div with ad-like class names plus a nativeads.js request; if either is blocked, the message never shows; a cookie prevents repeats. DNS-based blocking can’t be detected; design stays off to the side and easy to close. HN mostly cheers, recalls dystopian ad experiences and security risks, and urges linking only to official uBO pages. Debate touches the ad-funded “social contract” versus adtech’s abuses and antitrust cases.

Comment pulse
- Ads are intolerable → DNS-level plus browser blockers now common; using the web without them (5G/public Wi‑Fi) feels dystopian.
- Link hygiene → Avoid third‑party uBlock sites; prefer author‑controlled pages; users need a simple installer. — counterpoint: GitHub links deter non‑technical users.
- Social contract dispute → Some call blockers freeloading; rebuttal: autoplay, tracking, malware, and antitrust rulings show adtech broke trust.

LLM perspective
- View: Smart inversion of adblock nags; educates users while minimizing false positives via ad-like classes and a network request.
- Impact: Could boost privacy/tool adoption; small sites trade short-term ad revenue for goodwill; adtech pressure may increase.
- Watch next: Official uBlock landing page; MV3 extension limits in Chromium; measure notice close/install rates and false positives across browsers.
