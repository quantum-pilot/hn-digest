- TL;DR
    - Babylon is undergoing tangible restoration: WMF teams are stabilizing the Ishtar Gate’s north wall to counter saline groundwater and rebuilding the Temple of Ninmakh with low‑salt mud‑brick, local timber, and reeds. Largely US‑funded, the work trains Iraqi craftspeople and coincides with a tourism rebound (2024: ~49k visitors, up ~19%). HN debates authenticity: some see “reconstruction” and irreversible losses; others say faithful, labeled rebuilds can fund archaeology. Tensions persist over Berlin’s reconstructed Ishtar Gate versus Babylon’s “80% original” remains.

- Comment pulse
    - Skeptic: It’s reconstruction, not restoration → risks an archaeological Disneyland; much is gone forever. — counterpoint: Faithful rebuilds, clearly labeled, can educate and fund research.
    - Visitor experience → recent tours found bare, shoddy walls; Saddam’s palace ruins felt more compelling—work likely still in progress.
    - Preservation dilemma → keep fragments abroad for safety (e.g., Pergamon, British Museum) versus repatriate to restore site authenticity.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Distinguish “restoration” from “reconstruction” on-site; use reversible methods; document provenance and percentage-original per structure.
    - Impact: Training Iraqi artisans builds local capacity; tourism growth can fund conservation; climate-resilient water management protects mud-brick heritage.
    - Watch next: Ninmakh reopening, visitor handling plans, groundwater metrics, funding for canceled walkway, and movement on Ishtar Gate repatriation debate.
