# Refurb Weekend: Silicon Graphics Indigo² Impact 10000

- Score: 145 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45237717) | Link: http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/09/refurb-weekend-silicon-graphics-indigo.html

- TL;DR
    - A hands-on refurb of a Silicon Graphics Indigo² IMPACT 10000 turns a low-tier “Killer IMPACT” into a verified 195MHz R10000 Solid IMPACT unit. The post blends teardown steps (graphics/riser removal, Dallas DS1286 timekeeper replacement, RAM planning) with rich context on Indigo²’s arc (R4400 → R8000 stall → R10000), IMPACT graphics architecture, nonstandard 13W3 video, and finicky PSUs. HN amplifies the nostalgia and maintenance pragmatics: IRIX 6.5, SCSI-to-SD like ZuluSCSI, SSH/X usage—and debates MIPS versus SPARC/PA‑RISC longevity.

- Comment pulse
    - SGI as 90s icon; IRIX felt unmatched → lab memories and VFX use; distinctive cases and graphics inspired careers and enduring nostalgia.
    - Keep them usable → IRIX 6.5, SCSI emulators (e.g., ZuluSCSI), and X/SSH workflows; PSUs are common failures — counterpoint: recaps/ATX conversions exist.
    - MIPS mystique exceeded longevity → R8000 dead-end; R10K recall; industry rendered on SPARC/PA‑RISC; HP‑UX boxes outlasted SGI.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Preserve originals but modernize peripherals: RTC/NVRAM mods, SCSI-to-SD, and safe video adapters over irreversible board swaps.
    - Impact: Extends life of SGI, Sun, HP workstations; keeps IRIX-era software demonstrable for museums, researchers, and demos.
    - Watch next: Drop-in PSU replacements, community ROM/NVRAM tools, and reproducible benchmarks comparing Solid/High/Maximum IMPACT on R10K Indigo².
