# Models of European metro stations

- Score: 665 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45238055) | Link: http://stations.albertguillaumes.cat/

- TL;DR
    - A decade-long catalog of European metro and Stadtbahn stations models internal layouts and transfers in 3D, city by city. It contrasts shallow vs deep builds, side vs island platforms, cross‑platform and “Spanish solution” designs, and shows how planning history, terrain, and rail integration yield either quick hops or maze-like corridors. HN praised the scope and mobile UX, shared mega-station comparisons and local oddities, and suggested performance tweaks plus clearer coverage cues.

- Comment pulse
    - Shinjuku 3D model cited → showcases mega-station complexity; 3.6M/day. — counterpoint: broaden comparisons to Shanghai, Seoul, Taipei, Mumbai, not just Japan.
    - Zürich’s “metro” tunnels → actually tram conversions; tight clearances, left-hand running due to single-sided doors, near-fully compressed pantographs.
    - Site UX → widely praised; minor nits: sluggish zoom from thousands of markers; fix via clustering. Coverage: Châtelet–Les Halles exists via 3D view.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A living taxonomy of station typologies, revealing how history, depth, and constraints shape transfers and passenger flow.
    - Impact: Useful to planners, operators, and accessibility advocates for benchmarking layouts, dwell-reduction features, and cross-platform transfer quality.
    - Watch next: Add Asia and Americas; attach quantitative metrics and accessibility scores; cluster markers; publish data schema and model licensing.
