# Vibe coding has turned senior devs into 'AI babysitters'

- Score: 88 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45242788) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/

- TL;DR
    - TechCrunch reports that “vibe coding” (AI drafting code) often makes seniors into AI babysitters who prompt, verify, and repair brittle output. Fastly found 95% spend extra time fixing, with issues like hallucinated packages, duplicated logic, and security gaps spawning “vibe cleanup” roles. Despite this “innovation tax,” teams still lean on AI for prototypes, boilerplate, and UI scaffolding—paired with strict reviews and security scans. HN reactions are mixed: some feel slower and disengaged; others see cost-cutting replacing juniors and eroding mentorship.

- Comment pulse
    - AI slows many devs → prompting, review, and fixes exceed gains; METR study reports 20% slower despite perceived boost; boredom hurts morale.
    - Hiring pattern → replace juniors with AI to cut costs, risking mentorship pipeline and future expertise — counterpoint: junior cuts reflect belt-tightening, not just AI.
    - Team dynamics → vibe-coding feels like offshoring to overnight juniors; quality suffers; others find AI fine for boilerplate but slow and hard to context-switch.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Use AI as an intern-level generator with guardrails; optimize specs and tests; never merge without human review and security scanning.
    - Impact: Work shifts to requirements, integration, and audits; QA and AppSec load rises; junior training and code ownership erode if unchecked.
    - Watch next: Measure end-to-end velocity, defects, and vuln rates; evaluate multi-agent planners; define org policies restoring mentorship, pair-programming, and AI-change accountability.
