# Read to forget

- Score: 120 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45239601) | Link: https://mo42.bearblog.dev/read-to-forget/

- TL;DR
    - The author advocates “reading to forget”: expect to lose ~98% of details, but nudge your Bayesian worldview and harvest a few reusable nuggets; reading should spark ideas, not generate highlight hoards. HN splits: some resonate with Emerson-esque shaping without recall; others argue technical work needs multi-pass reading, structured notes, and citations. Some favor breadth over rereads to strengthen patterns, with a warning that a poor information diet can entrench harmful ideas; marginal annotation helps focus even if seldom revisited.

- Comment pulse
    - Reading shapes you despite poor recall → exposure updates thinking; echoes Emerson — counterpoint: vacuous slogan that could excuse forgetting everything.
    - Technical domains demand retention → multi-pass reads, recursive reference hopping, and structured notes (Obsidian/Logseq) aid understanding, traceability, and citations; highlighting alone is low-value.
    - Prefer breadth to rereads → multiple sources reinforce patterns; curate information diet to avoid amplifying harmful narratives.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Blend belief-updating with selective capture; add rigorous notes when reproducibility and attribution matter.
    - Impact: Fewer highlights, more paragraph summaries; better citations; clearer idea-to-experiment pipeline in research and engineering.
    - Watch next: Tools turning highlights into structured claims; metrics for “idea yield per hour”; lab norms for literature-review workflows.
