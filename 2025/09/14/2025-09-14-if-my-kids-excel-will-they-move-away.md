# If my kids excel, will they move away?

- Score: 229 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45236411) | Link: https://jeffreybigham.com/blog/2025/where-will-my-kids-go.html

- TL;DR
    - A CMU professor warns that recent U.S. hostility toward international students—visa chaos, detentions, politicized attacks on universities—could push research hubs abroad. If excellence moves, talented Americans may need to move too, widening family distances. HN notes early signs: top students choosing Europe, active diaspora-recruitment programs in India/Vietnam, and U.S. STEM’s dependence on visa holders. Some argue politics are cyclical, but near-term choices could lock in new talent centers.

- Comment pulse
    - Chilling effect on international students → detentions, visa chaos, and politicized attacks push talent to Europe/Asia; some Ivy admits already choosing EU.
    - US STEM R&D relies on visa holders → citizenship backlogs and generous diaspora programs (India, Vietnam, SK) lure faculty home; loss would hollow labs.
    - Plan around uncertain politics → families weigh non-US schools or Waterloo; field and scholarships matter — counterpoint: some argue current politics are transient; don’t overfit.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Stability and dignity in student immigration are competitive strategy; friction compounds and re-centers global talent tracks within a decade.
    - Impact: Universities and midwestern tech hubs lose density; families face longer-distance lives; allied countries gain labs, startups, and academic prestige.
    - Watch next: Top CS PhD enrollment shifts, faculty placement geographies, visa processing SLAs, speech-related detentions, and diaspora funding packages from India/Vietnam/South Korea.
