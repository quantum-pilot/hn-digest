# Fukushima insects tested for cognition

- Score: 104 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45238836) | Link: https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/fukushima-insects-tested-for-cognition

- TL;DR
  - CNRS/ASNR researchers used automated Y‑maze rigs and per‑insect tags to test learning and memory in honeybees and giant hornets across Fukushima’s cesium‑137 gradient. Healthy bees learn in ~10 trials; preliminary field data suggest slower learning in contaminated sites. Hornets were manually tested and fitted with dosimeters. Causality isn’t established and pesticides are unlikely confounders in depopulated zones. HN focused on barcode nitpicks (QR vs ArUco), skepticism about unpublished “decline” claims, and whether individual tests capture colony‑level cognition and pollination outcomes.

- Comment pulse
  - They’re only testing individuals → colony‑level behavior may compensate cognitive deficits; hive “superorganism” effects remain unmeasured.
  - “Decline” is premature → unpublished correlations need dose–response, replication, and non‑radiation controls — counterpoint: pesticides are minimal in the exclusion zone.
  - QR vs ArUco debate → photos look like fiducials; “QR” used generically for matrix barcodes, 2‑mm tags are plausible with close cameras.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Automated per‑bee cognition assays across radiation gradients are a scalable ecotoxicology tool beyond pesticides.
  - Impact: If learning drops with dose, pollination efficiency, crop yields, and ecosystem recovery plans around contaminated sites may need adjustment.
  - Watch next: Peer‑reviewed results, dose tracking per insect, colony‑level foraging metrics, and replication at non‑nuclear sites for external validity.
