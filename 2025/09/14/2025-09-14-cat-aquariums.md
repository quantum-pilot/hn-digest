# Cat Aquariums

- Score: 136 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45237970) | Link: https://cataquariums.com/

- TL;DR
  - A novelty fish tank is marketed for cats, with enclosed viewing cutouts/tunnels so felines can sit “inside” the aquarium perimeter and watch fish. The site touts polished edges, ultra‑clear glass, and claims of mental stimulation and stress relief; models list around $400. HN reacts with early‑internet hoax vibes, jokes, and skepticism about “cognitive” benefits. Debate centers on whether cats stay engaged vs. just sitting by a normal tank, and fish welfare (size, filtration, shape, and whether tubes stress fish).

- Comment pulse
  - Early‑web prank vibes → reminiscent of the “bonsai kitten” outrage era; feels engineered for virality.
  - Cat engagement likely persists → predatory focus and love of enclosed spaces sustain interest — counterpoint: could become an awkward, expensive regular aquarium.
  - Fish welfare risks → bowls are harmful due to size/filtration/optics; unclear if tunnels stress fish, with anecdotes but little evidence.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as furniture plus enrichment; demand specifics: tank volume, filtration, lids, access panels.
  - Impact: Cat enrichment improves; fish need hiding spots, stable water, and stress minimization.
  - Watch next: Independent reviews after months of use; welfare guidelines from aquarist groups; return policy and build quality reports.
