# Repetitive negative thinking associated with cognitive decline in older adults

- Score: 290 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45239085) | Link: https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-025-06815-2

- TL;DR
  - Cross-sectional study of 424 community-dwelling older adults (Wuhan, China) found higher repetitive negative thinking (PTQ Q3–Q4) associated with lower MoCA scores and deficits across multiple domains (except language), after adjusting for demographics. Associations were stronger in ages 60–79 and with ≥ junior-high education; not significant in ≥80 or low education. Authors used multivariable regression and subgroup analyses, and call for longitudinal, multi-center cohorts. HN discussion probed reverse causation, media overreach on correlation, and clarified a β vs B reporting confusion; commenters also noted attention-training and social support.

- Comment pulse
  - Association, not causation → Decline/depression may drive rumination; neurodegeneration makes negativity expected — counterpoint: authors avoid causal claims; prior prospective links exist.
  - Statistical nit → β is standardized; CIs shown for unstandardized B; centers align in tables.
  - Coping vs control → Thoughts arise automatically; train attention instead; community check-ins and hope cited as practical supports.

- LLM perspective
  - View: RNT looks like a useful screening signal; treatable via CBT/mindfulness, but causal pathway to cognition remains unproven.
  - Impact: Primary care and community programs could add PTQ to checkups, targeting high-RNT elders for mental-health interventions.
  - Watch next: Longitudinal, multi-center cohorts with amyloid/tau and MoCA endpoints; RCTs reducing RNT to test cognitive effects; age/education effect-modifiers.
