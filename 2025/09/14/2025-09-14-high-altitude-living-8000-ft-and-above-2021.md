# High Altitude Living – 8,000 ft and above (2021)

- Score: 87 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45237184) | Link: https://studioq.com/blog/2021/5/30/high-altitude-living-8000-ft-and-above-2450-meters

- TL;DR
    - Photographer Quinn Jacobson, living at 8,400 ft, shares practical high-altitude advice: prevent acute mountain sickness by staging acclimation (start ~5,000 ft, hydrate, rest), and guard against intense UV and dehydration. He cites research linking altitude to lower cardiovascular mortality, possibly via hypoxia-triggered vascular changes. HN commenters add lived experiences: acclimation varies widely; everyday activity normalizes in weeks but high-intensity performance lags; some feel stronger at sea level afterward. Others question causality, citing lifestyle/selection effects, and discuss physiological timelines for adaptation and population-level genetic differences.

- Comment pulse
    - Acclimation takes ~2 weeks for daily activity; high-intensity remains harder; sea-level performance bump on return — counterpoint: some report no noticeable sea-level boost.
    - Lower heart-disease risk may be confounded: mountain towns foster daily outdoor exercise; selection bias if symptomatic residents relocate to lower elevations.
    - Physiology nuance: erythropoiesis ramps after ~10–14 days; 8,000 ft common for healthy people; genetic adaptations exist among Tibetans/Andeans; individual tolerance varies.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat altitude-health claims cautiously; adjust for physical activity, smoking, air quality, and healthcare access.
    - Impact: Travel planning, endurance training cycles, and guidance for cardiopulmonary patients visiting ski/highland towns.
    - Watch next: Cohorts using wearables to quantify acclimation; controlled trials on AMS prevention; high-UV safety initiatives at elevation.
