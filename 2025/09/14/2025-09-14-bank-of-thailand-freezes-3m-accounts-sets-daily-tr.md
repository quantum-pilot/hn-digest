# Bank of Thailand freezes 3M accounts, sets daily transfer limits to curb fraud

- Score: 203 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45240304) | Link: https://www.thaienquirer.com/57752/bot-freezes-3-million-accounts-sets-daily-transfer-limits-of-50000-200000-baht-to-curb-6-billion-baht-scam-losses/

- TL;DR
    - Thailand’s central bank reportedly froze around 3M accounts and introduced daily transfer caps (e.g., 50k baht for “high‑risk” new customers; separate “vulnerable” group) to blunt rampant scams leveraging social engineering and device takeover. HN split: some see necessary friction akin to Brazil’s PIX safeguards; others call it heavy‑handed—sudden freezes, expat account closures, and limits that hinder legitimate large or urgent payments. Weak SMS 2FA and uneven branch enforcement surfaced as root problems; success hinges on precise targeting and fast unfreeze paths.

- Comment pulse
    - Necessary friction → Cheap, scalable scams justify caps and time‑of‑day throttles; similar to PIX safeguards—counterpoint: blunt limits signal weak fraud detection.
    - Collateral damage → Expat accounts closed and sudden freezes disrupt bills; 50k cap complicates emergencies; visa-policy/branch laxity created loopholes now shut.
    - Tactics evolve → Scammers “train” victims with small payouts, social proof, and remote device control; SMS 2FA norm in Thailand worsens exposure.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Use adaptive limits with step‑up verification for high‑risk transfers, not blanket freezes; add rapid appeals/unfreeze workflows.
    - Impact: Banks, expats, elderly, small merchants; risk of financial exclusion and cash flow shocks if false positives persist.
    - Watch next: Publish fraud/false‑positive metrics and unfreeze SLAs; replace SMS 2FA with in‑app/WebAuthn; whitelist vetted payees/medical providers.
