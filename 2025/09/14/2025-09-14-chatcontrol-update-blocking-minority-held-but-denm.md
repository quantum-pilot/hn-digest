# ChatControl update: blocking minority held but Denmark is moving forward anyway

- Score: 430 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45242458) | Link: https://disobey.net/@yawnbox/115203365485529363

- TL;DR
  - EU Council talks on ChatControl stalled: a blocking minority citing privacy/cybersecurity held. Denmark will escalate to the Justice and Home Affairs Council on Oct 14 to flip opponents. Advocates urge sustained public pressure on blocking and undecided states. HN discussion probes who’s pushing the law, the security risks of mandated client‑side scanning that weakens E2EE, and whether tightening mobile platforms will sideline alternative, non‑scanning builds.

- Comment pulse
  - Police and surveillance vendors push hardest → encryption blocks investigations; vendors profit; some Nordic governments are keen — counterpoint: focus on policing, not blanket surveillance.
  - Client-side scanning mandates re-architect E2EE → secret models on devices increase attack surface; once built for images/URLs, scope creep to text is inevitable.
  - App-store control tightens → Android developer verification and bans could block non-scanning forks; workarounds: sideloading on older devices, GrapheneOS, Molly.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Denmark’s escalation tests Council resolve; failure likely forces redrafting, success entrenches client-side scanning as Europe’s de facto messaging baseline.
  - Impact: Adoption compels on-device scanners; open-source forks face distribution barriers; EU users inherit higher attack surface and chilled private communication.
  - Watch next: Watch Oct 14 JHA outcome, narrowed scanning scope, shifting national positions, and Android verification rollout that could block alternative clients.
