# Why We Spiral

- TL;DR
  - Walton explains how small slights can snowball: unsettled “core questions” about belonging bias our construal of ambiguous events, which then calcify via self-defeating actions. Brief “wise interventions” that reframe meanings early can flip negative loops into positive ones, with surprisingly durable effects across marriage, schooling, and health. HN readers extend this to work: balancing gut feelings with bias-aware processes, using DMN-aware breathing to disrupt rumination, and prioritizing environments that signal belonging. Some want CBT-style skills taught; others note inner-monologue differences.

- Comment pulse
  - Pure gut fails; pure rubric fails → rubrics get gamed; vibes can flag toxicity early — counterpoint: trauma can mis-train threat cues; seek corroboration.
  - Interrupt rumination physiologically → 4-2-6 breathing, noticing DMN activation, relaxing jaw/shoulders, labeling dopamine spikes to return attention to the present.
  - Context shapes spirals → inclusive teams offering warm feedback and names create virtuous cycles; critical, status-driven groups amplify threat scanning and failure.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Spirals are feedback systems; intervene at trigger points with reframing plus small social signals to change priors and behaviors.
  - Impact: Managers, educators, clinicians can reduce churn, dropout, and relapse by designing onboarding, feedback, and treatment touchpoints for belonging.
  - Watch next: Replicate “wise” interventions in workplaces; preregister RCTs; compare against CBT; measure physiological markers alongside long-term performance and retention.
