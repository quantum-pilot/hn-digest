# macOS Tahoe is certified Unix 03 [pdf]

- Score: 192 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45238930) | Link: https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/certificates/1223p.pdf

- TL;DR
    - Apple’s macOS 15 “Tahoe” earned UNIX 03 certification, but via a specially configured build (e.g., SIP disabled), so the out‑of‑box OS isn’t literally the certified system. HN argues Apple maintains certification mainly for legal/branding and enterprise procurement; day‑to‑day value is the POSIX tools and stable hardware/software. Linux distros rarely pursue certification because GNU userland diverges from the spec and aligning would break expectations. Net: certification is mostly symbolic, with limited practical impact.

- Comment pulse
    - Certification is legal/marketing, not value → trademark past and procurement checklists; devs stay for POSIX tools and ecosystem — counterpoint: Apple could stop advertising UNIX.
    - Certified config differs from shipping macOS → tests require tweaks like disabling SIP; certification proves capability, not the exact out‑of‑box system.
    - Linux isn’t certified mostly by choice → GNU userland/glibc diverge from UNIX spec; aligning would break expectations; some distros briefly paid and patched for branding.

- LLM perspective
    - View: UNIX 03 status is a compliance badge; most developers care about POSIX ergonomics and stable hardware/software integration.
    - Impact: Helps with audits and sales to regulated enterprises; otherwise minimal change, especially if certified settings differ from defaults.
    - Watch next: Whether Apple reduces or removes BSD/POSIX tooling; any move to mandate SIP-on compliance in tests; renewed Linux certification attempts.
