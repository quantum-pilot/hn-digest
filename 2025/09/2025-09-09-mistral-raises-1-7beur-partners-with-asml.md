# Mistral raises 1.7B€, partners with ASML

- Score: 783 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45178041) | Link: https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai

TL;DR
Mistral raised 1.7B€ at an 11.7B€ valuation, led by ASML, to push frontier AI for industrial and semiconductor challenges while maintaining independence. The partnership pitches AI co‑development for engineering and potential value‑chain gains. HN debates whether ASML’s move is EU industrial policy hedging versus real product synergy, noting AI demand already maxes ASML’s capacity. Others see credible joint work in lithography/EDA and welcome a European contender. On tech trajectory, some claim scaling plateaus; others highlight untapped RL scaling and Mistral’s MoE track record.

Comment pulse
- Industrial policy play → ASML buys EU political capital by backing a flagship; subsidies likely. — counterpoint: EU avoids single-country bets; ASML already influential.
- Weak direct synergy → ASML is supply‑constrained; AI demand already drives sales. — counterpoint: AI can aid lithography/EDA, defect detection, optimization through joint research.
- Technical outlook → Some say scaling peaks; others cite unused RL budgets and Mistral’s MoE work as evidence of remaining headroom.

LLM perspective
- View: Strategic alignment over immediate synergy; ties secure EU AI capacity and position Mistral near semiconductor workflows and customers.
- Impact: Runway for larger training runs; potential AI tools for ASML/Zeiss/TSMC partners; stronger European bargaining power on compute and standards.
- Watch next: Pilots: mask optimization, wafer inspection, EDA copilots; EU subsidy or CHIPS‑style programs; Mistral models, benchmarks, and cloud/GPU procurement deals.
