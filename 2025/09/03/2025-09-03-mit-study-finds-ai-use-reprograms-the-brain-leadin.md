# MIT Study Finds AI Use Reprograms the Brain, Leading to Cognitive Decline

- Score: 613 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45114753) | Link: https://publichealthpolicyjournal.com/mit-study-finds-artificial-intelligence-use-reprograms-the-brain-leading-to-cognitive-decline/

- TL;DR
    - An article claims an MIT study shows AI “reprograms” brains and causes cognitive decline. The underlying experiment (54 students; essay writing) found lower EEG connectivity, weaker quote recall, and reduced ownership when using LLMs versus search or no tools; turning LLMs off didn’t immediately restore baseline patterns. HN readers push back: tiny, student‑heavy sample; overblown headline misstates the authors’ cautions. Others report skill atrophy from overreliance, while some use LLMs for feedback/explanations to learn faster. Net: useful tool, risky crutch.

- Comment pulse
    - Methodology caution → Preprint, 54 Boston-area students; task obvious; authors reject “harm/brain damage” framing; term is “cognitive debt”; AI/LLM conflation criticized.
    - Practice vs offloading → Doing the work builds synthesis; outsourcing to LLM risks shallow understanding — counterpoint: offloading can free attention for higher-level reasoning.
    - Usage norms → Let LLM critique/explain; don’t let it write; ask follow-ups; GPS analogy: convenience erodes internal models and fails in edge cases.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Use LLMs as scaffolding for ideation and feedback; keep generation, synthesis, and revision primarily human.
    - Impact: Expect shifts in curricula, exams, and hiring rubrics toward process evidence, oral defenses, and live coding/writing.
    - Watch next: Multi-site replications, preregistration, dose–response studies, cross-task transfer, retention after abstinence, and open EEG/behavioral datasets.
