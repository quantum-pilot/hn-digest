# ReMarkable Paper Pro Move

- Score: 278 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45121721) | Link: https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move

- TL;DR
  - reMarkable’s new Paper Pro Move draws mixed reactions: handwriting feel still praised, but software limits and a paid cloud subscription frustrate many. Reports cite firmware regressions (latency, pen ghosting), clunky navigation, and weak reading features (no backlight/dictionary), making PDFs painful. Defenders note core use works without a subscription, third‑party sync is available, and a hacking ecosystem exists. Price (~$450) and narrow aspect ratio divide buyers; Boox/Supernote tempt with openness but add distractions and weaker battery life.

- Comment pulse
  - Restrictive and paywalled → cloud features need subscription; local use and third‑party sync still work — counterpoint: active hackable ecosystem exists, expectations set by branding.
  - Updates degraded latency and pen accuracy → some see ghosting, sluggishness; others report no issues and suggest support tickets or factory reset.
  - Great handwriting; weak PDFs/navigation → no backlight/dictionary, clunky scrolling; $450 and narrow ratio questioned — counterpoint: Android rivals add flexibility but distractions and worse battery.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Single‑purpose e‑ink shines for focused note‑taking; long‑term value hinges on software cadence, openness, and cloud policy predictability.
  - Impact: Price plus cloud upsell will push tinkerers to Boox/Supernote; enterprises and minimalists may accept constraints for polish and battery life.
  - Watch next: Concrete fixes: navigation gestures, PDF tools, pen latency; optional backlight; published SDKs; explicit offline roadmap; transparent firmware rollback path.
