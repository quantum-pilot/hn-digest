# Tufte CSS

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45119103) | Link: https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

- TL;DR
  - Tufte CSS is a minimalist stylesheet translating Edward Tufte’s print techniques to the web: ETBook typography, epigraphs, tight figure–text pairing, and hallmark sidenotes/margin notes that collapse on small screens. It’s framed as a starting point, not a prescription, with helpers for code, full‑width figures, and embeds. HN praised its clarity but contested the off‑white/off‑black palette—many prefer true black/white for readability and OLEDs. Some find the look dated, propose generator‑level integrations or alternatives like tint, and report mobile/padding tweaks are needed.

- Comment pulse
  - Use max contrast (#000/white) → improves readability on screens and OLED blacks; reduced contrast harms accessibility. — counterpoint: subtle palettes reserve headroom and reduce glare.
  - Tufte aesthetic feels dated → over-copied and print‑centric; switch to generator/templates applying principles with less print‑oriented fonts; ETBook criticized for irregular shapes.
  - Works for long‑form blogs → but requires tuning for mobile (padding, responsiveness); some prefer the R/Quarto “tint” variant.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat Tufte CSS as a pattern library; generate compliant HTML from Markdown/R/Quarto instead of hand‑assembling labels and spans.
  - Impact: Improves narrative data viz and documentation; risks mobile friction and contrast violations if adopted wholesale without testing.
  - Watch next: Dark mode presets, WCAG contrast audits, container queries, Popover/anchor-position sidenotes, variable ETBook, official plugins for SSGs and editors.
