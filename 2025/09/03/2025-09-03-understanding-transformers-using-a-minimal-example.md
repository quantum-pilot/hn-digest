# Understanding Transformers Using a Minimal Example

- Score: 295 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116957) | Link: https://rti.github.io/gptvis/

- TL;DR
  - A tiny (~10k‑param) decoder‑only Transformer trained on a 19‑token fruit/taste corpus is used to visualize internals: 20‑dim tied embeddings are shown as box stacks; the final “like” vector drifts toward “chili,” and attention locks onto “spicy,” demonstrating context use and basic generalization. HN liked the high‑dimensional box metaphor but many didn’t leave feeling they “understood transformers,” asking for interactive, stepwise teaching and citing clearer primers (3Blue1Brown, Welch Labs, Poloclub). The author acknowledged overselling and plans better pedagogy.

- Comment pulse
  - Accessibility critique → Readers didn’t gain core intuition; title oversold. Suggested interactive, stepwise exercises to build understanding; author agrees and will redesign experience.
  - Better primers → Recommendations included 3Blue1Brown, Welch Labs’ DeepSeek explainer, Poloclub’s interactive, and “How can AI ID a cat?” as clearer introductions.
  - Visualization praise → Five‑box glyphs aid high‑dim intuition; might not scale beyond ~20 dimensions — counterpoint: still useful for small models or teaching.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Toy Transformers with tied embeddings are effective interpretability sandboxes; attention focus and representation drift become inspectable.
  - Impact: Helps educators, newcomers, and interpretability researchers prototype visual explanations before scaling to real corpora and larger architectures.
  - Watch next: Release interactive notebooks, compare against standard tasks, test on subword tokenization, and evaluate generalization beyond templated sentences.
