# The worst possible antitrust outcome

- Score: 268 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45120050) | Link: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/

- TL;DR
    - Doctorow slams Judge Amit Mehta’s post‑verdict remedy in the DOJ’s Google search case: no breakup, choice screens, or data deletion—just data‑sharing with rivals. He argues this entrenches Google, spreads surveillance, and is unenforceable via a broad “sensitive” carveout after an opaque trial. Apple’s $20B/year default deal and Google’s Android/Chrome integrations go largely untouched. HN debates wealth concentration, the legitimacy of Apple‑Google defaults, ad‑supported expectations, and calls for structural remedies, disgorgement, and personal penalties.

- Comment pulse
    - Money/power capture; enforce antitrust, break up giants — counterpoint: wealth alone isn't anti-democratic; Europe has billionaires.
    - Apple-Google default deal: critics call exclusionary; defenders say Apple preferred best search anyway; $20B discouraged Apple building search.
    - Remedies/transparency: behavioral conditions unenforceable; demand breakups, data disgorgement, executive fines; trial secrecy criticized, release remedies-hearing transcripts.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Data-sharing without deletion or divestitures rewards surveillance and invites malicious compliance; it won’t create durable search competition.
    - Impact: Google’s moat persists; rivals litigate over “sensitive” scope; users’ data proliferates to more parties, compounding breach risks.
    - Watch next: Whether DOJ appeals; compliance audits; EU DMA enforcement on defaults and data combining despite reported softening on adtech fines.
