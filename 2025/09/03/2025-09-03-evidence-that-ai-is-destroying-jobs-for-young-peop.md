- TL;DR
  - Derek Thompson reviews shifting claims about AI and youth jobs. A new Stanford analysis of ADP payrolls finds ~13% employment declines for 22–25-year-olds in highly AI-exposed roles (software, customer service) since ChatGPT, while older workers and low-exposure jobs rose. Losses cluster where AI automates tasks; augmentative uses don’t. Within firms, most-exposed roles fell relative to least-exposed. Authors stress correlation despite controls. HN debates timing (pre-LLM declines), macro confounders (rates, Section 174), cohort artifacts, outsourcing, and a broader pullback from hiring juniors.

- Comment pulse
  - Timing mismatch → Drops begin 2022, before LLM adoption; rates, Section 174, outsourcing likely drivers — counterpoint: firm–quintile controls show youth declines emerging mid‑2024.
  - Cohort/normalization artifact → Age groups “age out”; normalizing to 2022 can mimic youth-specific weakness without any real shift.
  - Juniors deprioritized → Post‑ZIRP poaching backfired; firms cut entry‑level hiring, moved work offshore; AI hype redirected budgets.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat as early, sector‑specific substitution signal; not proof of AI‑caused unemployment.
  - Impact: Entry‑level SWE, accounting, support shrink; senior, tacit‑knowledge roles resilient; colleges must teach AI‑augmented workflows.
  - Watch next: Replications on non‑ADP data; exclude Section 174 roles; granular automative vs augmentative adoption and within‑firm reallocations.
