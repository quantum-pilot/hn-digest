# Garmin beats Apple to market with satellite-connected smartwatch

- Score: 245 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45118286) | Link: https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/garmin-satellite-smartwatch/

- TL;DR
  - Garmin’s Fenix 8 Pro brings built‑in inReach satellite plus LTE to a rugged sports watch: location check‑ins, two‑way messaging, LiveTrack, and SOS routed via Garmin Response. New microLED hits 4,500 nits; AMOLED/microLED models cost $1,200–$2,000 with 10–27‑day battery claims. It lands a day before Apple’s satellite‑rumored Watch Ultra 3. HN notes Garmin’s stellar hardware but mixed software, price/battery trade‑offs for LTE/display, and paid inReach plans, while praising Garmin’s data openness and seeing the appeal for hikers despite casuals balking.

- Comment pulse
  - Garmin hardware lauded; software clunky but improving. Fenix 8 Pro dinged for price and LTE/display battery hits; athletes prefer Enduro/MIP — counterpoint: rugged simplicity appeals.
  - Costs bite: inReach adds $40 activation, $8/month, per-message fees; Apple satellite is free and iOS APIs favor Apple Watch. Outdoor users still want SOS.
  - Openness praised: USB mass storage and APIs (GarminDB); Gadgetbridge enables cloudless use. But true offline Bluetooth sync inconsistent across brands; Suunto/Amazfit reported to work.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Garmin is monetizing safety plus durability; Apple pushes integration and zero-fee satellite—two divergent playbooks for similar features.
  - Impact: Outdoors prosumers benefit; endurance athletes may skip Fenix 8 Pro for MIP models; Apple users face continued lock-in advantages.
  - Watch next: Battery/display trade-offs vs satellite radios; Apple Ultra satellite details and pricing; regulatory moves on iOS smartwatch APIs.
