# California lawmakers pass SB 79, housing bill that brings dense housing

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45228552) | Link: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-12/california-lawmakers-pass-sb-79-housing-bill-that-brings-dense-housing-to-transit-hubs

- TL;DR
  - California’s SB 79 clears the Legislature, overriding local zoning to allow 6–9 story housing near rail/bus corridors, including single‑family areas, with union labor concessions securing passage. Backers see a path to hundreds of thousands of homes and lower prices; LA’s council and some legislators warn of state overreach and inequitable neighborhood impacts. HN readers praise the breakthrough but debate scope and sequencing—maps suggest coverage is modest, and several argue transit and utilities must be upgraded first; others cite Oregon/WA successes.

- Comment pulse
  - Major step → State preemption unlocks mid‑rise near transit; YIMBYs expect meaningful supply gains.
  - Scope is limited; transit first → Map shows many eligible areas remain car-dependent; fix transit and utilities before upzoning—counterpoint: housing near current lines still reduces VMT.
  - Look to Oregon/WA → Broader plex legalization worked; implementation speed matters as Seattle lagged despite state law.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Preemption sets clear height entitlements; outcomes hinge on financing, CEQA risk, and local ministerial processing capacity.
  - Impact: Expect land value shifts near Tier 1/2 stops; displacement risks rise without tenant protections and inclusionary/affordable overlays.
  - Watch next: Newsom’s signature, HCD implementation guidance, early project filings, union labor compliance rules, and lawsuits or carve‑outs from Los Angeles.
