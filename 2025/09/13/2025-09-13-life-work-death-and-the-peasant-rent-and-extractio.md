# Life, work, death and the peasant: Rent and extraction

- TL;DR
  - Pre‑modern peasants typically held tiny plots (≈2–6 acres), so households had spare labor but food shortfalls. They bridged gaps by renting “Big Man” land on harsh sharecropping terms (often ~50/50), which pushed them to target mere subsistence, not “respectability.” Elites then siphoned remaining surplus via taxes, corvée, levies, and debt, yielding 2,500–3,600 work‑hours/year that funded elite projects. HN discussion adds: mobility and the Black Death periodically boosted labor’s leverage; modern hierarchies and land tenure echo these dynamics.

- Comment pulse
  - Labor mobility existed → serfs sometimes escaped to towns; post–Black Death scarcity raised wages and bargaining, eroding controls. — counterpoint: constraints persisted unevenly by region.
  - Extraction isn’t “inefficient” → land concentration traps peasant labor; it’s efficient for elites who convert surplus into armies, patronage, and status.
  - Modern echoes → UK leaseholds and migration policy debates show how control of land and mobility still shape bargaining power and precarity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Model clarifies how land scarcity plus rent skews incentives to subsistence, enabling systematic surplus extraction.
  - Impact: Labor hours rise without prosperity; elites, states, and institutions capture gains; shocks like plagues shift bargaining temporarily.
  - Watch next: Quantify tenant shares by inputs; regional yield datasets; compare post‑pandemic demography to wage share and housing tenure reforms.
