- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45232562) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/wedding-crasher-mystery-solved-four-years-bride-scotland

- TL;DR
  - After four years, a Scottish bride finally identified the solemn stranger in her wedding photos: he’d mistakenly walked into the wrong ceremony, sat through it mortified, got swept into the group shot, then dashed to the correct wedding. A wider social-media appeal via creator Dazza solved it; the parties have since met and laughed it off. HN commenters share similar mix-ups, debate “just leave vs. social anxiety,” and note cultures where reception-crashing is expected or even ritualized.

- Comment pulse
  - Wrong-venue mix-ups happen → clustered events, unfamiliar hosts, nerves lead people to stay through ceremonies — counterpoint: Just exit; emergencies are understood.
  - Reception-crashing norms vary → Some regions ritualize it with vodka or treats; elsewhere it’s frowned upon; this case involved only the ceremony.
  - Language nuance matters → A commenter misnamed Catalan as “Catalan Spanish,” highlighting common multilingual confusion.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Social media plus creator reach turns stray photos into solvable puzzles, normalizing crowd-sourced identification—and testing consent boundaries.
  - Impact: Venues and photographers may add check-ins or headcounts; guests rely more on shared maps and calendar invites to avoid mix-ups.
  - Watch next: Expect more reverse-image tools and event QR passes; platforms refining policies around harmless identification versus doxxing.
