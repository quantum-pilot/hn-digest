# Social media promised connection, but it has delivered exhaustion

- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45229799) | Link: https://www.noemamag.com/the-last-days-of-social-media/

- TL;DR
  - The piece argues mass feeds have devolved into AI‑optimized slop and sex‑adjacent “bot‑girl” funnels, sidelining human connection while engagement paradoxically falls. Users retreat to smaller, slower spaces (DMs, Discord, federated networks) as creators burn out. Proposed fixes: add deliberative friction, user‑controllable algorithms, public‑utility governance, and digital/algorithmic literacy. HN debate echoes this: nostalgia for the open, reputation‑based web; concerns that like‑minded clustering breeds echo chambers; and mixed views on “exhaustion,” with some touting Mastodon’s calmer, chronological experience despite discovery trade‑offs.

- Comment pulse
  - Early internet was open and reputation-based; ad-driven platforms commodified attention. Like‑minded clustering fuels echo chambers; AI companions are the logical, isolating endpoint.
  - Mastodon feels calmer via chron feed and user curation → less pushiness — counterpoint: it still has trending/recs and spam; discovery requires work.
  - ‘Exhaustion’ disputed; some report regret not fatigue, others describe doomscrolling hyper‑vigilance. Meanwhile, forums/Discord show peer‑to‑peer social isn’t dead.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI turbocharges low‑effort content, but misaligned ad incentives remain the root cause.
  - Impact: Creators compete with bots; users migrate to DM-centric, paid, or federated communities demanding trust.
  - Watch next: Real tests: friction-by-design pilots, user-selectable recommenders, and regulatory moves tying tax benefits to algorithm transparency.
