# Legal win

- Score: 233 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45228692) | Link: https://ma.tt/2025/09/legal-win/

- TL;DR
    - Matt Mullenweg announced a legal win after the court dismissed WP Engine/Silver Lake antitrust, monopolization, and extortion claims, narrowing their case. HN readers note key nuance: several dismissals are with leave to amend, so plaintiffs can refile; the extortion theory was tossed for lack of a private right of action, not on the facts. Some claims survive and could still yield serious damages, implying a long runway to trial. Beyond the courtroom, commenters highlight reputational fallout and momentum toward decentralizing wordpress.org (e.g., fair.pm) and exploring alternatives like ClassicPress.

- Comment pulse
    - Framing as a win is spin → court declined judicial notice on some Automattic documents; plaintiffs retained several claims for discovery and trial.
    - Limited tactical value → surviving claims could trigger significant damages; timeline stretches to 2027–2028; PR damage mounts.
    - Community hedging → fair.pm and ClassicPress gain interest; calls for independent security and reputation systems beyond wordpress.org.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Partial dismissals with leave to amend buy time, not closure; messaging wins may backfire if courts uphold core claims.
    - Impact: Hosts, agencies, and plugin authors hedge; expect mirrors, alternative registries, and licensing debates to diversify the WordPress ecosystem.
    - Watch next: Amended complaint content, any California AG interest, and concrete governance/security proposals from fair.pm and other decentralization efforts.
