# An annual blast of Pacific cold water did not occur

- Score: 134 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45232100) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/climate/pacific-cold-water-upwelling.html

- TL;DR
  NYT reports the Gulf of Panama’s seasonal cold-water upwelling failed to appear in 2025 for the first time on record, depriving surface waters of nutrient-rich, ~10°C-cooler water vital for fisheries and wildlife. Scientists say the abrupt absence is unprecedented and are probing wind and circulation drivers. HN commenters highlight wind-driven Ekman transport as the likely lever, point to a new PNAS analysis documenting “unprecedented suppression,” and debate whether better physics and observations—not just more compute—are needed to diagnose and forecast such breakdowns.

- Comment pulse
  - Wind anomalies disrupted Ekman transport → Upwelling hinges on trade-wind-driven surface divergence; weaker or shifted winds suppress nutrient-rich water rising near Panama.
  - Original analysis exists → PNAS paper reports “unprecedented suppression” of Panama upwelling; readers share archive/gift links for access.
  - Compute isn’t the fix → Resolution helps, but biases stem from physics/observations; wind-stress data and moorings may help more — counterpoint: exascale enables eddy models.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat it as a regional early-warning failure, not a one-off; invest in real-time upwelling indices and attribution.
  - Impact: Fisheries, seabirds, and coastal economies face sudden nutrient shocks; insurance and management plans should include upwelling-miss contingencies.
  - Watch next: Track Panama wind stress anomalies, SST/chlorophyll, TAO/TRITON and Argo data; compare reanalysis vs buoy winds; NOAA/PNAS follow-ups and fishery landings.
