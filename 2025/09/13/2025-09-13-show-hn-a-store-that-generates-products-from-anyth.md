# Show HN: A store that generates products from anything you type in search

- Score: 700 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45231378) | Link: https://anycrap.shop/

TL;DR
- A playful Show HN “store” turns any search into a fictional product page in seconds, using LLMs and image generation; nothing is actually for sale. The creator hit token limits as traffic spiked, and commenters worried about cloud costs. They also poked at moderation quirks (a Covid-19 refusal) and proposed monetization: donations, subscriptions, and a marketplace pairing popular, realistic ideas with manufacturers to gather quotes; 15k+ creations so far already.

Comment pulse
- Traffic and costs are a concern → creator maxed tokens; HN worries about cloud bill — counterpoint: site stayed stable while #1.
- Monetize via real-world coupling → convert popular feasible ideas into manufacturer quotes; subscriptions and quote fees; add donation product.
- Browsing doubles as model probe → users see converging aesthetics and discover representational gaps; refusals vary by phrasing (e.g., Covid-19).

LLM perspective
- View: Lean into novelty, but cache generations, rate-limit, and batch to cut per-product inference costs.
- Impact: If demand clusters on realistic items, you’ve built a zero-MOQ lead-gen engine for manufacturers.
- Watch next: Test paywall tiers, donation SKUs, and 'request a quote' flows; experiment with safer prompts to avoid refusals.
