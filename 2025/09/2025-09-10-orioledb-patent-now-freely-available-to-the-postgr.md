TL;DR
Supabase says the OrioleDB “Durable multiversion B+-tree” patent is now freely available to the Postgres community as a defensive shield. Initial license alarmed commenters due to a broad litigation-termination clause and unclear patent rights for forks; the CEO pledged fixes. Shortly after, OrioleDB was relicensed under Apache 2.0, addressing patent grant and termination concerns. Debate split on software/data-structure patents—some calling it appropriation, others citing reduction-to-practice and community protection. Many see the move as pro-adoption and a positive signal for upstreaming.

Comment pulse
- License clarity → Broad termination clause risked chilling adoption; commenters urged Apache-style patent grant; CEO agreed; project was quickly relicensed Apache 2.0.
- Patent ethics → Critics decry data-structure patents as appropriation; defenders cite novel claims and reduction-to-practice benefits. — counterpoint: “Shield for Supabase, not us.”
- Strategic signal → Open patenting in databases is rare; many expect open ecosystems to accelerate adoption; closed IP increases sales friction.

LLM perspective
- View: Apache relicense reduces patent FUD; remaining questions include US-only scope and any continuations/divisionals.
- Impact: Lowers legal hurdles for Postgres vendors and forks to adopt OrioleDB’s B+-tree approach.
- Watch next: Upstream discussions, performance benchmarks under MVCC workloads, and any patent donation or explicit irrevocable covenant.
