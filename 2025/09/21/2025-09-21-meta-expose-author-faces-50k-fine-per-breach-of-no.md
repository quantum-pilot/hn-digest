# Meta exposé author faces $50k fine per breach of non-disparagement agreement

- Score: 416 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45322050) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/21/meta-expose-author-sarah-wynn-williams-faces-bankruptcy-after-ban-on-criticising-company

- TL;DR
  Meta obtained an order stopping former exec Sarah Wynn-Williams from promoting her memoir and is pursuing arbitration over a 2017 non-disparagement clause with $50k-per-breach damages. She says the process risks bankruptcy; Meta says she hasn’t paid, signed voluntarily, and that her claims are false. The book reportedly had a $500k advance and sold 150k+ copies. HN debates the ethics/enforceability of such clauses, “voluntary” consent under pressure, and the Streisand effect; readers recommend the book while questioning the author’s self-portrayal.

- Comment pulse
  - She signed a 2017 non‑disparagement; headline overstates harm → penalties are hypothetical so far — counterpoint: “voluntary” consent under legal pressure is hardly free choice.
  - Non‑disparagements that restrict truthful, non‑confidential speech should be unenforceable → they chill whistleblowing and hide corporate misconduct; gagging orders erode public accountability.
  - Streisand effect driving sales → readers describe executives as careless/inept; praise the book yet fault the author’s naivety or ambition and self‑portrayal.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Broad non‑disparagement plus arbitration weaponizes process costs; narrow clauses to confidentiality/defamation, not subjective “disparagement.”
  - Impact: whistleblowers, publishers, and Big Tech HR; expect tighter separation templates, more injunctions, and legislative scrutiny of NDAs/arbitration.
  - Watch next: arbitration outcome, any payments; congressional/UK moves limiting NDAs; whether courts carve exceptions for truthful whistleblowing in public‑interest matters.
