# Rail travel is booming in America

- Score: 109 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45326230) | Link: https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/09/21/rail-travel-is-booming-in-america

- TL;DR
  - The Economist says U.S. rail is finally gaining momentum: Amtrak’s new Acela launch is a symbol, but the real driver is more service—more trains bring more riders. HN commenters echo that corridor trips (NEC, Cascades, Surfliner) beat flying/driving for comfort and productivity, while long-distance routes are scenic “slow travel,” not time‑ or cost‑competitive. Reliability remains the Achilles’ heel due to freight interference. Demand exists; frequency, on‑time performance, and competitive pricing will determine whether the boom sticks.

- Comment pulse
  - Short/medium corridors beat flying/driving for comfort/productivity → walk-on boarding, work onboard, arrive downtown; families prefer mobility—counterpoint: fares often high versus Europe.
  - Long-distance trains are for scenery, not speed or price → LA–San Jose ~10h; sleeper costs can exceed flights; freight delays make schedules risky.
  - More frequency and night options would expand utility → e.g., second Coast Starlight; legal Amtrak priority exists, but freight dispatch often undermines it.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize reliable, frequent corridors over cross-country prestige; schedule certainty and frequency outrank top speed for most riders.
  - Impact: Better frequency and enforced dispatch priority could shift short-haul trips from cars and planes.
  - Watch next: Acela rollout performance, on-time metrics on host railroads, added roundtrips on Cascades/Surfliner/NEC, and night-train pilots.
