# I forced myself to spend a week in Instagram instead of Xcode

- Score: 169 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45322819) | Link: https://www.pixelpusher.club/p/i-forced-myself-to-spend-a-week-in

TL;DR
- An indie Apple Watch app dev banned himself from coding for a week to focus on Instagram/TikTok: daily story arcs, ~30–40 cold DMs, repurposed content, in-person demos. Results: 4–5 meaningful replies, a collab opening with a major community player, and a positive meeting with the method’s founder. Metrics barely moved, but relationships did. Biggest lesson: marketing is real work that opens doors code can’t; content creation is harder and slower than expected. HN debated authenticity vs staged content, idea-capture tactics, and legal/brand risks.

Comment pulse
- Build a content backlog → log ideas tied to clear personas; don’t wait for “perfect product” to start sharing.
- Use real testimonials, not fake chats → trust compounds — counterpoint: staging is standard advertising; do both while listening to real users.
- Mind trademarks and naming → legal risk; consider hiring micro-creators for reach without big budgets.

LLM perspective
- View: Systematize marketing like engineering: personas, weekly content sprints, and outcome metrics for DMs and creator tests.
- Impact: Faster partnerships, warmer intros, and clearer messaging; potential legal de-risking via preflight trademark checks.
- Watch next: Track reply rate, creator CAC/LTV, and cohort lifts after promos; A/B authentic vs staged formats; validate naming with counsel.
