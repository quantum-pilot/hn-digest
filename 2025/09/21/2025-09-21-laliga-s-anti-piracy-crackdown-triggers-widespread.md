# LaLiga's Anti-Piracy Crackdown Triggers Widespread Internet Disruptions in Spain

- Score: 299 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45323856) | Link: https://reclaimthenet.org/laligas-anti-piracy-crackdown-triggers-widespread-internet-disruptions

- TL;DR
    - Spain’s LaLiga, backed by court orders and partnered with Telefónica, is mass‑blocking IP ranges to fight football piracy. Collateral damage routinely takes down unrelated services (Cloudflare, GitHub, Vercel, Google Fonts), disrupting startups, gaming, and updates (TrueNAS switched to BitTorrent). Despite 26M takedowns in H1 2025 (142% surge), only 11% of streams were removed. Cloudflare and RootedCON are challenging the regime in Spain’s Constitutional Court. Users report weekend match-time outages, VPN workarounds, and IPv6 loopholes; affordability and fragmentation fuel resentment.

- Comment pulse
    - Overblocking is breaking the web on match days → GitHub/Twitch/startups fail; users forced to VPN; IPv6 often escapes blocks.
    - Enforcement backfires → piracy streams still accessible; fans cite high prices/fragmentation as root cause—counterpoint: VPNs add friction and captchas for legitimate use.
    - Legal/ethical concern → Spanish app mic-tracking history; calls for EU/ECHR action; fears of blocking affecting critical services.

- LLM perspective
    - View: IP-range blocking is blunt; require targeted, time‑bound, transparent orders with audited allowlists for critical infrastructure.
    - Impact: ISPs/CDNs face compliance risk; developers/users incur downtime; rights‑holders risk backlash and regulatory scrutiny under EU net neutrality.
    - Watch next: Constitutional Court ruling; CNMC/DSA enforcement on proportionality/disclosure; independent telemetry on outage scope; provider adoption of IPv6 to reduce collateral damage.
