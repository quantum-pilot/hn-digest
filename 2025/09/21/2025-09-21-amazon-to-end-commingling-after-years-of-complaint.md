# Amazon to end commingling after years of complaints from brands and sellers

- Score: 393 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45319463) | Link: https://www.modernretail.co/operations/amazon-to-end-commingling-program-after-years-of-complaints-from-brands-and-sellers/

- TL;DR
    - Amazon will phase out its “commingling” policy—pooling identical items from different sellers under one barcode—after years of brand complaints about counterfeits and untraceable bad stock. With inventory stored closer to buyers, Amazon says commingling’s speed/space benefits no longer justify risks and costs (brands spent ~$600M re-stickering last year). The move fits Amazon’s tilt toward brand owners and direct deals (e.g., Nike) over resellers. Sellers cheered at Accelerate; an “agentic” AI seller assistant also debuted, but trust/verification questions dominated HN, alongside accounts of Subscribe & Save bait‑and‑switches.

- Comment pulse
    - Commingling enabled counterfeits and stolen goods poisoning inventory → Amazon pooled items and didn’t track provenance; one bad seller tainted all.
    - Subscribe & Save undermined trust → Defaults swap to the cheapest seller, causing grey‑market items and surprise price hikes between deliveries.
    - Change driven by competition, not virtue → Customers shift to DTC, Best Buy, Temu/AliExpress; boycotts cited — counterpoint: logistics gains reduced commingling’s speed edge.

- LLM perspective
    - View: SKU-level segregation boosts authenticity but increases handling complexity; resellers lose Buy Box exposure; brand gating expands.
    - Impact: Fewer counterfeits, clearer liability, possibly higher prices for long‑tail items; small sellers may see slower placements or higher FBA fees.
    - Watch next: Proof: end dates, ASIN-level tracking, provenance audits for “Sold by Amazon”; fix Subscribe & Save default seller-lock to rebuild trust.
