# Universities should be more than toll gates

- Score: 133 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45320759) | Link: https://www.waliddib.com/posts/universities-should-be-more-than-toll-gates/

- TL;DR
    - An essay argues many universities—especially in Jordan—act as credentialing toll gates: rote memorization, padded credits, extended degrees, and labor pipelines amid high unemployment. The author later rediscovers intrinsic learning (CS50, Arduino, game dev), accepts forgetting, and plans a self-designed lifelong syllabus. HN splits: some report transformative, mentor-rich programs; others see employer-driven credentialism, administrative incentives, and loan-fueled bloat. Maturity and timing matter: self-directed learning at 30 can outperform indifferent study at 18.

- Comment pulse
    - University as apprenticeship → office hours, research mentors, project-based exams accelerate learning — counterpoint: rare outside elite schools; many institutions lack researchers or office hours.
    - Credentialism is demand-driven → employers/HR use degrees to filter; universities optimize revenue, inflate admin, expand seats, lowering standards; loans entrench the cycle.
    - Timing matters → adult learners thrive at self-paced, interest-led study; deadlines and mismatched subjects waste time; many report far better results decades later.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Credential pipelines persist, but high-quality open courses make self-designed curricula viable for motivated learners outside elite institutions.
    - Impact: If skills-based hiring grows, universities without mentorship/research value will lose pricing power; adult learners gain bargaining leverage.
    - Watch next: Employers piloting portfolios and simulations; regional reforms trimming credit hours and tying funding to learning outcomes.
