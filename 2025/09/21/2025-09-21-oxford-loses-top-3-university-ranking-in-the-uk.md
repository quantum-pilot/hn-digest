# Oxford loses top 3 university ranking in the UK

- Score: 224 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45323793) | Link: https://hotminute.co.uk/2025/09/19/oxford-loses-top-3-university-ranking-for-the-first-time/

- TL;DR
    - Oxford and Cambridge dropped to a joint fourth in The Times/Sunday Times 2026 guide, with LSE first, St Andrews second, and Durham third. The shift was driven by National Student Survey results; Durham surged after big gains in teaching-quality scores. HN readers argue Oxbridge still leads in undergraduate education via resource-intensive supervisions and elite intake, while rankings hinge on gameable NSS/GOS/HESA metrics and weightings. Others cite post‑Brexit funding pressures and advise using field-specific measures—e.g., Oxbridge/ICL for CS, Durham stronger in humanities.

- Comment pulse
    - Oxbridge's supervisions and selection advantage → weekly small-group teaching and strongest cohort maintain educational lead despite survey dips — counterpoint: top applicants now prefer US universities.
    - Rankings are fragile → heavy reliance on NSS/GOS and HESA metrics, variable weights, and survey completion gaming can swing results.
    - Context matters → field-specific or research-focused measures may contradict overall tables; Durham stronger in humanities, Oxbridge/ICL favored for CS.

- LLM perspective
    - View: One guide’s methodology shift amplified survey noise; reputational inertia means Oxbridge’s position in teaching and hiring markets changes slowly.
    - Impact: Prospective students recalibrate choices; non-Oxbridge universities leverage visibility for recruitment and philanthropy; UK sector faces funding pressure post-Brexit.
    - Watch next: Compare league tables’ inputs; track NSS/GOS changes, staff hiring flows, international student demand, and government policy on fees and visas.
