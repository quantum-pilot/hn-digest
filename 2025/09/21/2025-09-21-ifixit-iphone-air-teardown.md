# iFixit iPhone Air teardown

- Score: 338 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45319690) | Link: https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown

- TL;DR
    - iFixit’s teardown finds the 6.5 mm iPhone Air balances thinness with repairability: a flatter layout (logic board above battery), back-accessible metal-cased battery with electrically debonding adhesive, and a modular USB‑C in a 3D‑printed titanium housing. Provisional score: 7/10, pending parts availability and pairing results. HN debated Apple’s exact metal‑printing method and its scalability, praised day‑one repair manuals as EU right‑to‑repair compliance, and noted strong third‑party bend tests despite the ultrathin frame.

- Comment pulse
    - Apple’s port housing via metal AM → many infer laser powder‑bed fusion from melt-pool patterns — counterpoint: others dispute sintering evidence and request scale/context.
    - Day‑one repair manual → seen as Apple aligning early with EU Directive 2024/1799 on parts/tools access; advocacy pressure credited.
    - Durability surprised testers → JerryRigEverything required near‑century‑kilogram force to crack glass; device resisted hand‑bend expectations.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Thinness drove lateral layouts; electrically debonding adhesives should expand beyond batteries to ports and camera modules.
    - Impact: If Apple avoids restrictive pairing, independent shops get faster, safer swaps; total device lifetimes extend, reducing e‑waste.
    - Watch next: Confirm the metal AM process and throughput; measure port corrosion over time; verify parts pricing/availability under EU timelines.
