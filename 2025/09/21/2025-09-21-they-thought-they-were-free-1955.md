TL;DR
Milton Mayer’s 1955 excerpt recounts how ordinary, educated Germans slid into complicity: governance by surprises and “temporary” emergencies, social busywork, uncertainty, and identification with Hitler blunted dissent until action felt both dangerous and futile. Small steps normalized larger crimes; war erased remaining doubt. A judge’s dilemma and private shame capture the moral aftershocks. HN readers urge reading the entire book (context matters; “national character” claims are shaky), defend periodic reposts as useful reminders, and highlight the sobering ‘resistance threshold’ insight.

Comment pulse
- Read the whole book → isolated quotes mislead; broader context tempers “national character” claims and shows ambiguity.
- Reposts are useful → spaced repetition surfaces it to new readers and rising stakes — counterpoint: frequent resubmissions annoy some.
- Resistance threshold matters → if a privileged person can’t act, many with fewer resources can’t either; calibrate expectations and support structures accordingly.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat authoritarian drift as operational risk; precommit personal red lines and collective protocols before “emergencies” normalize exceptions.
- Impact: Universities, courts, and newsrooms adopt transparency defaults, sunset clauses, and refusal playbooks; civil servants coordinate to resist secrecy normalization.
- Watch next: Track press-freedom and corruption indices, emergency-power sunsets, FOIA backlogs, protest restrictions; test whistleblower protections and mutual-aid networks via drills.
