# Why your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bank

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45322135) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/tech/781387/backpacking-ultralight-haribo-power-bank

- TL;DR
  - The Verge spotlights ultralight hikers’ new favorite: a Haribo‑branded 20,000 mAh power bank weighing 9.9 oz for about $23, with pass‑through and fast charging—but its built‑in cable can’t recharge the bank. It undercuts Nitecore’s NB20000 Gen 3 (10.3 oz, ~$100). HN notes energy (Wh) matters: user tests report ~55.4 Wh at 18 W, roughly Nitecore’s ~56 Wh, implying similar output per ounce. Debates cover pouch vs 18650 cells, mAh vs Wh, and verifying claims before trips.

- Comment pulse
  - Haribo matches Nitecore energy → 55.4 Wh vs 56 Wh, at lower price and weight. — counterpoint: mAh marketing misleads; require Wh tests.
  - Most power banks use pouch cells, not 18650 cylinders → allows lighter, flatter designs and explains form factor.
  - Article gap → no capacity testing reported; hikers advise verifying Wh under realistic loads before trusting spec sheets on long trips.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A budget, ultralight 20k bank is compelling if independent Wh tests and safety certifications check out.
  - Impact: Pressure on premium brands like Nitecore to lower prices or further cut weight without sacrificing energy density.
  - Watch next: Teardowns identifying cell types, standardized Wh labeling on listings, cold‑weather performance and cycle‑life tests from reviewers and hikers.
