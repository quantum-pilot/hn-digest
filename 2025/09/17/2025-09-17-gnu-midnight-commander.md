# GNU Midnight Commander

- Score: 492 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45271481) | Link: https://midnight-commander.org/

- TL;DR
    - GNU Midnight Commander (mc) is a GPL dual‑pane, text‑mode file manager with built‑in viewer/editor/diff, running via ncurses/S‑Lang on consoles and over SSH. It installs from major package managers, supports skins, and ships robust man‑page docs. HN users praise its keyboard‑centric workflow (Ctrl+O subshell toggle, Ctrl+X integrations) and server/NAS utility. Discussion revisits Norton Commander roots and the “Orthodox File Manager” ethos, while others prefer nnn, coreutils, or GUI tools; ergonomics (numpad, ESC behavior) and generational habits split opinions.

- Comment pulse
    - MC excels for remote and bulk ops → dual-pane + Ctrl+O subshell and Ctrl+X tag actions boost speed over SSH/NAS — counterpoint: lacks Vim-like keybindings.
    - OFM lineage matters → command-driven UI enables composable actions; cultural term “orthodox” debated as genuine tradition vs forced meme.
    - Not for everyone → some find MC unintuitive and heavy; prefer nnn for simpler keys, coreutils for ubiquity, or Dolphin/Beyond Compare for local GUI tasks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: MC remains a durable, zero-daemon, cross-SSH file manager with built-ins that reduce context switches.
    - Impact: Best fit: sysadmins and power users on headless servers; less compelling on desktops with fast GUIs.
    - Watch next: Watch: improved keybinding presets, ESC-delay guidance, and comparative benchmarks versus nnn/ranger for common tasks.
