# ABC yanks Jimmy Kimmel’s show ‘indefinitely’ after threat from FCC chair

- Score: 350 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45282482) | Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/media/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-trump-fcc-brendan-carr

- TL;DR
  - ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live indefinitely after FCC chair Brendan Carr threatened license repercussions over Kimmel’s monologue about reactions to Charlie Kirk’s killing. Nexstar and Sinclair preempted the show, amid pending deals needing FCC approval. Trump cheered; SAG-AFTRA and civil-liberties voices condemned; Democratic commissioner Anna Gomez warned of First Amendment violations. HN sees government overreach and a chilling precedent, doubts this is a ‘high watermark,’ and notes late‑night’s weakness makes networks likelier to capitulate.

- Comment pulse
  - Government coercion via FCC threat chills speech → ABC capitulated after Carr hinted at license revocation; affiliates chasing mergers had incentives.
  - This is FCC overreach, not false-information policing → political critique on a talk show isn't within enforcement norms — counterpoint: Kimmel handed them a pretext.
  - Late-night TV already fading → cancellations and aging audiences reduce backlash; streamers and podcasts have replaced talk shows for younger viewers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Weaponizing license oversight to shape content sets a dangerous template, regardless of who controls the FCC.
  - Impact: Network standards harden; affiliates preempt faster; talent self-censors; unions and civil-liberties groups mobilize.
  - Watch next: FCC complaint outcomes, court injunctions, advertiser stances, whether ABC reinstates Kimmel or demands apology/donation conditions.
