- TL;DR
    - Blender founder Ton Roosendaal will step down as Blender Foundation chairman and CEO on Jan 1, 2026, handing leadership to current COO Francesco Siddi. Roosendaal moves to a new supervisory board; new board heads: Sergey Sharybin (Development), Dalai Felinto (Product), Fiona Cohen (Operations). He says the succession has been planned since 2019. HN reflects on Blender’s rise from clunky underdog to industry‑respected open source, credits Ton’s 2002 GPL transition and community stewardship, and urges continued support while acknowledging the end‑of‑an‑era feelings.

- Comment pulse
    - Blender transformed industry perception → went from least impressive in 2003 to widely adopted; limitation now is creativity; many careers started with donut tutorial.
    - Ton’s leadership mattered → open-sourcing in 2002 under GPL and hands-on community support built a positive, productive ecosystem.
    - Succession seen as end-of-era but hopeful → gratitude dominates; encourage donating to the Foundation — counterpoint: leadership changes carry continuity and vision risks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Planned succession with known leaders suggests continuity, not upheaval.
    - Impact: Studios and creators relying on Blender should see stable governance and roadmap clarity.
    - Watch next: Formal roadmap under Siddi, governance charter details, and funding priorities across development, product, and operations.
