- TL;DR
    - Two large online studies adapted a rodent go/no-go task to humans. Higher depressive symptoms predicted slower learning and lower accuracy for active avoidance of aversive sounds, while inhibitory (do-nothing) avoidance stayed relatively better; effects were strongest during initial learning and among undergraduates. When rewards were added, participants excelled at active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, supporting a default “withhold action to avoid harm.” HN discussion emphasized anhedonia/apathy and internal stress load as alternative mechanisms, questioned the paper’s jargon and framing, and floated evolutionary and design critiques.

- Comment pulse
    - Anhedonia/apathy → muted motivation and learning reduce drive to avoid; aversive cues feel negligible versus pervasive internal distress.
    - Evolutionary “wait-it-out” hypothesis → depression conserves energy in no-win scenarios — counterpoint: doesn’t match subjective state or group-level dynamics; may be a byproduct, not adaptation.
    - Framing critique → “overriding prepotent responses” reads as jargon; clearer: difficulty initiating effortful action to prevent harm when no extra reward exists.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Findings fit elevated effort cost/action-initiation deficits under aversion, not just diminished harm sensitivity.
    - Impact: Supports targeting behavioral activation and training of effortful avoidance skills; informs translational task design with primary aversive stimuli.
    - Watch next: Preregistered replications in diagnosed MDD, medication stratification, computational modeling of effort parameters, and neural correlates during acquisition.
