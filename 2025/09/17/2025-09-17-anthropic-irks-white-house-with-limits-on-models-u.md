# Anthropic irks White House with limits on models’ use

- Score: 223 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45279143) | Link: https://www.semafor.com/article/09/17/2025/anthropic-irks-white-house-with-limits-on-models-uswhite-house-with-limits-on-models-use

- TL;DR
    - Semafor reports Anthropic angered the Trump White House by refusing carveouts allowing FBI/Secret Service/ICE surveillance uses of Claude, even as the models serve GovCloud and top‑secret needs. Officials call Anthropic’s policy moralizing and vague; rivals allegedly offer law‑enforcement exceptions. HN readers contest the framing, arguing this is routine procurement with known restrictions, and see the deeper tension: SaaS lets vendors enforce acceptable‑use limits, which some support when it blocks citizen surveillance.

- Comment pulse
    - Routine contracting, not scandal → agencies vet ToS; restrictions known pre-signature — counterpoint: ToS can change; model-side filters may outpace contract updates.
    - Semafor overstates uniqueness → other vendors restrict surveillance; Microsoft’s AI terms ban ongoing tracking without consent; carveouts are negotiable but not universal.
    - SaaS power vs ethics → centralized control enables enforceable AUPs; some welcome refusals on surveillance even if it costs Anthropic federal revenue.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI vendors will increasingly gate government use via AUPs, forcing clearer definitions of “surveillance” and lawful exceptions.
    - Impact: Procurement shifts: agencies demand contractual supremacy over model filters; accredited alternatives (open, on‑prem) gain leverage.
    - Watch next: Whether Anthropic narrows policy language, rival models gain TS/IL6 clearance, or federal guidance standardizes AI usage carveouts across agencies.
