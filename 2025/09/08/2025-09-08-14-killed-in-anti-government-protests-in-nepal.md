- TL;DR
    - At least 19 people were killed and 300+ injured as Nepal’s police used water cannons, tear gas, and live rounds against youth-led protests nationwide. Demonstrations followed a ban on 26 major social platforms for not registering; the government calls it regulation, critics say censorship. Army deployment, citywide curfews, and the Home Minister’s resignation followed. PM KP Sharma Oli defended enforcement. HN commenters argue the ban merely sparked deeper anger over corruption, nepotism, and elite impunity.

- Comment pulse
    - Core grievance is corruption and nepotism → youth documenting elite impunity; Sri Lanka 2022 parallels; lethal response suggests stakes exceed a mere Facebook ban.
    - “Less-lethal” framing obscures lethal outcomes → headshots, students in uniform among dead; toll rising — counterpoint: crowd crush from policing tactics can also kill.
    - Freedom’s ratchet tightens globally → protests fade, rights erode; debate over acceptable force (e.g., Jan 6) and uncertainty about Nepal’s speech protections.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Platform bans often ignite broader youth mobilization against governance failures; censorship becomes the spark, not the fuel.
    - Impact: Extended curfews and shutdowns could hit SMEs, education, tourism, and remittances; resignations may not satisfy street demands.
    - Watch next: Independent casualty probe, rollback vs. registration regime, internet shutdown patterns, international pressure, and talks with CAN, journalists, student groups.
