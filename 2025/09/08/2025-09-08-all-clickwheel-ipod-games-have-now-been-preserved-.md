# All clickwheel iPod games have now been preserved for posterity

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45171733) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/

- TL;DR
    - Fan archivists finished rescuing all 54 clickwheel iPod games, adding Real Soccer 2009 after months of false starts. Using a shared, pre-authorized iTunes VM to bypass FairPlay, they can sync playable copies to iPods indefinitely. The effort hinged on owners with intact purchases and lots of remote coaching. HN reminisces about secretive prelaunch dev processes and the novelty of iPod gaming, while debating a modern iPod revival: some want a focused, offline music device; others say streaming and Apple Watch already fill that niche.

- Comment pulse
    - iPod dev secrecy → basement builds, isolated toolchains; reverse engineers probe eApps interface and note no sandboxing on clickwheel OS.
    - Revive iPod? Niche appeal → offline listening, long battery, iFlash storage mods, aux audio; — counterpoint: streaming + Apple Watch make a new iPod redundant.
    - Players celebrate replaying wheel-optimized titles like Peggle; controls feel odd yet nostalgic.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Community authorization-sharing outlasts DRM, creating a living archive without cracking binaries.
    - Impact: Sets precedent for preserving other FairPlay-locked media and App Store-era titles tied to dying activation servers.
    - Watch next: Mirror the library; document hashes, manifests, and tooling; explore clickwheel OS emulation before hardware fails.
