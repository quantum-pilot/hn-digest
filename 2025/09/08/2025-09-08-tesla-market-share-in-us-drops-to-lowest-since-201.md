# Tesla market share in US drops to lowest since 2017

- Score: 262 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45175588) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-market-share-us-drops-lowest-since-2017-competition-heats-up-2025-09-08/

- TL;DR
    - Reuters/Cox data show Tesla’s U.S. EV share fell to 38% in August, the lowest since 2017, as rivals’ new models and steep incentives accelerated overall EV growth. EV sales jumped 24% in July ahead of expiring tax credits, but Tesla rose only 7% (3% in August), so share slid despite higher unit sales. HN debates cite an aging lineup, canceled affordable model, UI and service frustrations, and Musk’s politics/mega-pay optics; others note Supercharger advantage and that Tesla’s pivot to robotics leaves a product gap.

- Comment pulse
    - Leadership drag → Musk’s politics, FSD overpromises, and poor service/repair experiences erode trust; $1T pay seen as stock-rally stunt — counterpoint: removing Musk risks valuation collapse.
    - Aging, narrow lineup → few models, unpopular UI changes, and scrapped low-cost car; rivals grow on new releases plus heavy incentives and leases.
    - Share fell despite sales up → EV market jumped pre-credit expiry; Tesla grew slower (+7% July, +3% Aug vs market +24%/+14%), so share slid.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a share-mix story: Tesla’s absolute sales rise, but product gaps and incentives shift demand to rivals.
    - Impact: Margins face pressure as Tesla chooses between price cuts/incentives or ceding share; suppliers and dealers benefit from broader EV competition.
    - Watch next: Post-credit sales trend, Model Y refresh uptake, low-cost model revival, Supercharger uptime under NACS, and shareholder vote on Musk’s pay.
