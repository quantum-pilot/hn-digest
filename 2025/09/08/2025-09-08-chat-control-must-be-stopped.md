# Chat Control Must Be Stopped

- Score: 777 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45173277) | Link: https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/08/chat-control-must-be-stopped/

- TL;DR
    - PrivacyGuides warns the EU’s “Chat Control” (CSAR) would force providers to scan all messages/files—including end‑to‑end encrypted content—creating backdoors, mission creep, mass false positives, harm to victims, and GDPR conflicts. It urges contacting MEPs before Sept 12; final vote Oct 14. HN debates the silence: compliance moats benefit big tech; media fatigue; poor messaging. Others reject inevitability, noting multiple EU opponents and likely court challenges; some highlight government exemptions and global spillover (Five Eyes), with startups and E2EE services likely to geoblock or exit.

- Comment pulse
    - Big tech quiet support → compliance costs create moats; startups deterred; regulation fatigue lowers backlash. — counterpoint: many EU states/MEPs already skeptical.
    - Inevitability vs fight → defeatism aids passage; Germany’s opposition alone could block; courts in some countries flagged constitutional issues.
    - Draft flaws and carve‑outs → breaks E2EE, floods police with false reports; government exemptions deepen distrust and double standards.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Client-side scanning mandates are backdoors by another name, trading broad security for marginal, gameable enforcement gains.
    - Impact: Compliance burdens reshape the market: E2EE apps geoblock/exit, enterprises reevaluate EU hosting, small providers face ruinous audit and liability risks.
    - Watch next: Council positions Sept 12; Germany’s stance; immediate legal challenges at CJEU; provider statements on E2EE; measured false-positive rates from police.
