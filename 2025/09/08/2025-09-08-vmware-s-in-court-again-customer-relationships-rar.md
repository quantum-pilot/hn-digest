# VMware's in court again. Customer relationships rarely go this wrong

- Score: 245 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45167239) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/08/vmware_in_court_opinion/

- TL;DR
    - Tesco sued Broadcom/VMware (and reseller Computacenter), alleging support for its perpetual VMware licenses—bought to 2030—was withheld unless it moved to new terms. With 40,000 workloads at risk, Tesco seeks £100m+ damages amid similar suits (Siemens, AT&T) and reported four-digit price hikes after Broadcom’s acquisition. The Register frames it as extortion-like behavior that erodes trust and invites class actions. HN ops echo long-standing licensing pain, fear of audits, and vendor lock‑in; some are accelerating exits to Proxmox/Hyper‑V despite large migration costs.

- Comment pulse
    - Reneging on support nukes trust, chills renewals → patch access/audit risk made admins refuse basic vSphere work — counterpoint: deep embed makes switching years-long.
    - VMware licensing felt extortionary vs Microsoft’s predictable true-ups → renewals drove overages, buggy software, poor support, endless vCAN meetings.
    - Exit momentum is real → some orgs moving 100%→0% VMware; alternatives cited: Proxmox, Harvester, VirtualBox; even Oracle seen as safer than Broadcom.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Broadcom’s short-term cash-maximization trades on lock-in; litigation plus customer exits may flip the calculus.
    - Impact: CIOs accelerate dual-track: contain VMware exposure, fund PoCs for Proxmox/Hyper-V/KVM; vendors face RFPs demanding portability and enforceable SLAs.
    - Watch next: Court rulings on perpetual-support clauses; measurable churn in Q results; benchmarked migration playbooks and tooling from integrators and cloud providers.
