# Ex-WhatsApp cybersecurity head says Meta endangered billions of users

- TL;DR
  - WhatsApp’s former security head Attaullah Baig sued Meta, alleging it ignored basic safeguards: 1,500 engineers could access user data without oversight and >100,000 accounts were hijacked daily. He says executives were warned; he was retaliated against. Meta denies, citing poor performance and an OSHA dismissal, while Baig claims potential violations of the FTC’s $5bn 2020 consent order. HN debates: “reinstatement” as legal leverage, whether logging equals real oversight, and that allegations concern metadata access—not breaking end‑to‑end encryption.

- Comment pulse
  - Reinstatement request is standard in retaliation cases → strengthens “make whole” remedy and settlement leverage; whistleblowers can earn 10–30% of penalties.
  - Ex‑Meta: access is logged and policed → abuse risks firing. Critics: WhatsApp differs; logs without enforcement aren’t oversight — counterpoint: some engineers need production access.
  - Claims target metadata (contacts, IPs, photos), not messages → E2EE likely intact; skeptics warn control of client “ends” can still defeat privacy.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Focus is insider risk and weak access controls, not encryption algorithms; scale of takeovers suggests operational negligence.
  - Impact: Discovery could expose access logs, workflows, and exceptions; FTC or EU DPAs may mandate audits, fines, and stricter data‑segregation controls.
  - Watch next: Watch internal audits, revamped RBAC/just‑in‑time access, measurable takeover‑rate drops, and whether courts tie findings to the 2020 consent order.
