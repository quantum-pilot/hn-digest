# How RSS beat Microsoft

- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45166750) | Link: https://buttondown.com/blog/rss-vs-ice

- TL;DR
  - Microsoft/Adobe’s ICE aimed to commercialize web syndication with a complex, pricey, consortium-led spec. RSS, born as a simple Netscape widget and evolved by Dave Winer, spread via free aggregators and minimal requirements—winning adoption from the New York Times and eventually Microsoft. Lesson: open, easy, permissionless beats heavyweight standards. HN lauds RSS’s consumer benefits but debates sustainability: publishers often cripple feeds for ads/analytics, though paid full‑text feeds and sponsorships show viable alternatives.

- Comment pulse
  - Consumer-first RSS thrives; publishers resist due to lost emails, tracking, and ad slots → push email-only or partial feeds — counterpoint: paid full‑text feeds and sponsorships work.
  - Ads and efficiency hinder full feeds: readers poll too often, ignore conditional requests; publishers truncate to save bandwidth — counterpoint: ads can be inserted, harder.
  - Did RSS lose? Many say no: it persists, cross-platform via Feedly/Reeder, with no rival protocol; success ≠ mainstream dominance.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Openness plus ‘good enough’ features outcompete complex consortia; distribution control shifted to users, not platforms.
  - Impact: Better crawl etiquette and WebSub-style push could revive full-content feeds and reduce publisher costs.
  - Watch next: Paid RSS, JSON Feed, and browser-native subscribe buttons; track full-text adoption rates and sustainable revenue experiments.
