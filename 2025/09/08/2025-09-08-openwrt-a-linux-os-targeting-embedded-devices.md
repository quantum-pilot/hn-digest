# OpenWrt: A Linux OS targeting embedded devices

- Score: 268 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45170087) | Link: https://openwrt.org/

- TL;DR
    - OpenWrt is a Linux OS for embedded devices with a writable filesystem and packages, prioritizing user control. The project now ships its own $89 OpenWrt One router (Wi‑Fi 6, PoE, unbrickable) and continues regular releases (24.10.2). HN users praise its reliability and flexibility, often choosing hardware around it. Pain points: multi-device management and setting guest/VLANs via LuCI. Some want a more “normal” distro on powerful routers; others want better low-end support. Hardware drivers (e.g., Broadcom) and aging devices constrain compatibility.

- Comment pulse
    - Reliability via deliberate setup → Pick OpenWrt-supported hardware, separate router/AP roles, put gear on UPS; reboots are rare.
    - Network-centric management lags → Guest/VLANs in LuCI are fiddly; vendor mesh apps are simpler; OpenWISP targets ≥20 devices — counterpoint: not designed for home.
    - Bigger vs smaller targets → Some want Debian/systemd base on beefy routers; others prefer ultra-lean builds; x86/VM deployments work well.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Owning hardware plus steady releases strengthens OpenWrt’s ecosystem and funding, but UX parity with consumer mesh remains the hurdle.
    - Impact: SMB and prosumer markets could shift from proprietary stacks to OpenWrt-based gear if small-network fleet management becomes turnkey.
    - Watch next: Measure: one-click guest/VLAN wizards, basic IDS/IPS options, better Broadcom/Qualcomm Wi‑Fi drivers, OpenWrt Two shipping, and integration with lightweight controllers.
