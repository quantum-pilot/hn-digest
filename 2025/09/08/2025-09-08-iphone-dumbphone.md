# iPhone dumbphone

- Score: 678 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45171200) | Link: https://stopa.io/post/297

- TL;DR
  - An engineer “supervised” his iPhone with Apple Configurator, factory-resetting it to disable the App Store and whitelist only needed sites/apps. The added friction prevents impulsive changes while keeping utilities (maps, rides, chat, LLMs). After two months, screen time dropped ~2 hours/day; the phone “feels like a tool.” Biggest unresolved issue: filtering “semi-important” email without losing urgent alerts. HN discusses alternative approaches (device separation, cold-turkey/notifications-off, Assistive Access/Focus modes, email whitelisting, added-friction tools) and practical constraints like payments/navigation.

- Comment pulse
  - Split devices: strip phone to utilities; keep entertainment on an at-home tablet → reduces temptation, improves battery.
  - Cold turkey week + pocket notebook → reveals true necessities; some just disable all notifications — counterpoint: daily payments/navigation make this impractical for many.
  - Alternatives: Assistive Access/Focus modes, Android ROMs with push control, Foqos/QR locks, grayscale → add friction; email whitelisting/paid inboxes tame alerts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Friction-first design beats willpower; supervised mode is a durable “personal MDM” for attention management.
  - Impact: Normalizes utility-only phones; pressures Apple to ship a first-class “Utility Mode” with enforceable schedules.
  - Watch next: Data on relapse/screen-time deltas; improved Assistive Access/Focus APIs; smarter on-device email prioritization.
