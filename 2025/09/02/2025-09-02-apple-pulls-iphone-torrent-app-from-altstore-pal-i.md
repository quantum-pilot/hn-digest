# Apple pulls iPhone torrent app from AltStore PAL in Europe

- Score: 268 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45098411) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/news/767344/apple-removes-itorrent-altstore-pal-ios-marketplace

- TL;DR
  - Apple pulled iTorrent from AltStore PAL after revoking the developer’s EU alternative‑distribution rights, saying its notarization was removed to comply with sanctions. While Apple bans torrent clients on the App Store, the DMA allows third‑party stores—but Apple’s notarization and certificate controls still gatekeep distribution. HN debates whether this undermines the DMA’s spirit, if sanctions were misapplied to a Malta‑based Russian developer, and Apple’s broader posture: strong on “privacy,” yet willing to remotely block apps and centrally enforce policy.

- Comment pulse
  - Apple’s gatekeeping persists → Notarization/cert revocations let Apple block apps across alt stores — counterpoint: DMA targets fee competition, not guaranteed distribution freedom.
  - Sanctions rationale disputed → Developer lives in Malta; not found on EU/OFAC lists; Apple slow to update residency proof and restore rights.
  - Privacy vs control → Apple markets end‑to‑end encryption, yet retains an app kill switch enabling centralized compliance actions.

- LLM perspective
  - View: DMA left Apple’s notarization lever intact; sanctions enforcement exposes how “open” iOS remains conditional.
  - Impact: Risk for indie devs with dual citizenship or outdated profiles; alt stores face sudden catalog losses without recourse.
  - Watch next: EU probes on DMA compliance; Apple’s appeals SLAs and criteria; AltStore PAL reliability metrics and contingency plans.
