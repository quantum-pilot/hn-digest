# Kazeta: An operating system that brings the console gaming experience of 90s

- Score: 312 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45098269) | Link: https://kazeta.org/

- TL;DR
    - Kazeta is an OS that boots directly into a game by scanning removable media for a KZI “cartridge” manifest, recreating 90s simplicity: no DRM, accounts, launchers, or updates. It autosaves and offers a retro BIOS for save management, targeting DRM‑free PC and emulated console titles. HN likes the tangible, offline “one‑game‑per‑card” idea but flags vague marketing, overlap with Steam Deck/EmuDeck, and limited hardware/controller support. Requests include multi‑game carts or cart‑as‑key modes; nostalgia meets today’s update‑heavy, microtransaction landscape.

- Comment pulse
    - Overlaps with Steam Deck → EmuDeck + SD mimic carts; KZI boot/BIOS saves appeal, but hardware and controller support unclear — counterpoint: simpler for kids.
    - Real data on the card beats RFID “keys” → tangible, offline ownership resonates; some miss true cartridge-era hardware traits (bus access, co-processors) impossible on PCs.
    - Desire for offline, no-DRM play → players resent launchers, patches, microtransactions, long updates; Kazeta promises “insert, power, play” like 90s consoles.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A single-purpose distro with KZI manifests; success hinges on dead-simple cart authoring and broad GPU/controller compatibility.
    - Impact: Living rooms, kids’ setups, arcades, and museums gain offline curation; GOG/itch libraries become physical, loanable, durable.
    - Watch next: Latency and boot-time benchmarks, Proton/Wine game list, cart creation GUI, controller matrix expansion, and preapproved mini‑PC bundles.
