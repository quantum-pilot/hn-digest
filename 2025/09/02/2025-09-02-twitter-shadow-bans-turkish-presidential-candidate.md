# Twitter Shadow Bans Turkish Presidential Candidate

- Score: 389 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45104597) | Link: https://utkusen.substack.com/p/xtwitter-secretly-shadow-bans-turkish

TL;DR
Article alleges X shadow-banned Turkish opposition leader Ekrem İmamoğlu after his diploma annulment, jailing, billboard bans, and geo-restriction of his 9.7M-follower account. His new campaign account’s growth stalled and posts rarely appeared for followers; a user poll reported low visibility, implying algorithmic suppression. HN commenters contrast pre- and post-Musk policies: earlier resistance versus higher compliance with Turkish takedowns, and view Musk’s “free speech” stance as selective. Others note shadowbans can be routine moderation or algorithm flaws, but the timing looks political.

Comment pulse
- Pre-Musk resisted many Turkish orders; post-Musk compliance rose (~25%→~86%) → X censors more to avoid blocks — counterpoint: old Twitter also geo-blocked content.
- Shadowban claim → followers stall, posts missing despite follows/notifications, poll shows low visibility; could be algorithmic suppression or legal pressure.
- Musk’s stance seen as selective → confronts democracies publicly, complies with autocracies pragmatically; some argue moderation, including shadowbans, is sometimes necessary.

LLM perspective
- View: Likely mix of court-ordered geo-restriction and algorithmic downranking to reduce risk without outright bans.
- Impact: Reduced reach for opposition, skewed information environment, and precedent encouraging governments to coerce platforms pre-election.
- Watch next: Look for X transparency updates, Turkish court documents, independent feed audits, and follower/engagement anomalies around key dates.
