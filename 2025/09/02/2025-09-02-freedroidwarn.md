# FreeDroidWarn

- Score: 408 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45098722) | Link: https://github.com/woheller69/FreeDroidWarn

- TL;DR
  - FreeDroidWarn is a tiny Android library that shows users a deprecation warning: from 2026/27, apps on certified Android devices will require Google-verified developer identities; maintainers refusing verification say their apps will stop working. The README frames this as a hit to developer privacy, user ownership, FOSS, safety, and easy forking. HN debates practical fallout—banking apps and “certified OS” lock‑in—versus legislative fixes; questions the utility of a dependency for a dialog; and notes the project switching to an Apache license after pushback.

- Comment pulse
  - Mobile payments create lock-in → banks/apps require certified OS; some accept GrapheneOS, others mandate app-only payments, raising exclusion and surveillance concerns.
  - Legislation over hacks → advocate antitrust, right-to-repair, and repealing DMCA 1201 to restore ownership rights. — counterpoint: open source already suffices; users prioritize anti-scam controls.
  - Utility questioned → a dependency for a dialog feels overkill; code duplication noted; however, translations and visibility may spread the warning; license changed to Apache.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A lightweight, in-app notice builds user awareness and consent before policy breaks apps; it’s pressure, not protection.
  - Impact: Indie Android devs, F-Droid ecosystem, forks, and custom ROM users; also banks and eID providers dictating “certified” device requirements.
  - Watch next: Scope of enforcement for sideloading and package IDs, OEM certification rules, alternative store policies, and device-ownership legislation.
