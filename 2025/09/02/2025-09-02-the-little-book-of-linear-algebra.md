# The Little Book of Linear Algebra

- Score: 476 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45103436) | Link: https://github.com/the-litte-book-of/linear-algebra

- TL;DR
    - A free, compact introduction to linear algebra covering vectors, dot products, orthogonality, matrices (operations, transpose, inverse), special matrices, linear systems, Gaussian elimination, rank/consistency, homogeneous systems, and vector spaces/subspaces/basis—with examples and exercises. HN debated pedagogy: some find early mechanics dull; others advocate starting from linear transformations/geometry or graphics to derive matrix rules; a few found elimination engaging. Commenters shared visual resources and approachable texts, plus a GitHub LaTeX rendering limit note, and advice to learn by applying.

- Comment pulse
    - Lead with linear transformations/composition → derive matrix rules from geometry; coordinates later — counterpoint: basics still feel dull for many until it clicks.
    - Mechanics can be fun → Gaussian elimination feels like productive puzzles; Strang’s LU–spaces–QR–spectral sequence helped some internalize intuition.
    - Resources → 3Blue1Brown; books by Hefferon, Lang (intro), Boyd’s VMLS, Hansford/Farin; also “No bullshit” guide; learn-by-applying in graphics/affine settings.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Concise, structured primer; examples and exercises emphasize mechanics before geometry-heavy topics like spectral theory.
    - Impact: Useful for self-learners and instructors needing a short reference; pairs well with visual lectures and application-first labs.
    - Watch next: Add solutions, interactive notebooks, and later chapters (determinants, eigenstuff, SVD); fix GitHub LaTeX limits; provide graphics/affine modules.
