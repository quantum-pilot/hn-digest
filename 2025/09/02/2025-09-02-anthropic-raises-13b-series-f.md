# Anthropic raises $13B Series F

- Score: 590 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45104907) | Link: https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation

- TL;DR
  - Anthropic raised $13B Series F led by ICONIQ at a $183B post‑money valuation, citing rapid adoption: ~300k business customers, run‑rate revenue up from ~$1B (Jan 2025) to >$5B (Aug), and Claude Code at ~$500M run‑rate. Funds go to securing compute/power, safety research, and international expansion. HN debated whether the true moat is access to GPUs and electricity, if escalating training costs and six‑month model cycles are sustainable, and whether 20x run‑rate is rational optimism or classic bubble fuel.

- Comment pulse
  - Compute/power scarcity is the moat → frontier training needs vast GPUs and dedicated power; costs soar while model lifespans shrink — counterpoint: investors back new power sources.
  - Scaling spend outruns gains → marginal improvements slow; unclear ROI and short cycles risk implosion — counterpoint: per‑model P&Ls can be positive until scale equilibrium.
  - $13B round at ~20x run-rate isn’t proof of a bubble → market demand and oversubscription suggest strength — counterpoint: WeWork/SBF show markets misprice risk.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Differentiation shifts to secured compute, energy contracts, and vertical integration, not just model weights.
  - Impact: Favors firms with upstream partnerships (TSMC, power utilities, cloud credits); open-source lags at frontier spend.
  - Watch next: Inference price trends, multi‑year GPU/energy PPAs, enterprise retention/NRR, and standardized productivity benchmarks beyond demos.
