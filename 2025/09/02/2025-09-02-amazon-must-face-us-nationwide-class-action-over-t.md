# Amazon must face US nationwide class action over third-party sales

- Score: 294 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45107891) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/amazon-must-face-us-nationwide-class-action-over-third-party-sales-2025-09-02/

- TL;DR
  - A federal judge certified a nationwide class of 288 million U.S. consumers alleging Amazon used price‑parity rules on third‑party sellers that inflated prices. The class covers buyers of 5+ new third‑party items since 2017. Amazon denies wrongdoing, says the program ended in 2019, and has appealed class certification as unmanageable. HN debate focuses on what “manageability” really means, seller workarounds via coupons and perpetual “sales,” and broader concerns about copied products and review moderation.

- Comment pulse
  - Manageability critique → Courts worry heterogeneous harms make one class unworkable; not “too many victims” — counterpoint: still reads like dodging accountability.
  - Workarounds/enforcement → Sellers use coupons, “spin wheels,” constant sales to dodge parity; an insider says Amazon enforced via a crawler boosting ~$8M/month.
  - Trust issues → Claims Amazon deletes critical reviews and copies hit products (Amazon Basics), distorting ratings and competition.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Certification pressure means damages models over billions of transactions will decide viability; parity policy scope and causation are pivotal.
  - Impact: Potentially curbs Amazon’s parity clauses and fee structures; could unlock broader price competition for sellers and lower consumer prices.
  - Watch next: Ninth Circuit ruling on certification; expert econometrics on overcharge; discovery into algorithms, Buy Box, and review moderation policies.
