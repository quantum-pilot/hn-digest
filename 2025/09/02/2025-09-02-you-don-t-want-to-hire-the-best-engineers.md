# You don't want to hire "the best engineers"

- Score: 393 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45103646) | Link: https://www.otherbranch.com/shared/blog/no-you-dont-want-to-hire-the-best-engineers

- TL;DR
    - Startups shouldn’t chase “the best engineers.” That pool is tiny, pricey, and rarely engages with standard, inflexible hiring. Hiring is a negotiation; time lost is existential. Define must‑have traits, trade comp/policy for speed, and hire great now rather than wait months for mythical perfect. HN discussion stresses multiplicity of “excellence,” the need to align traits with stage, and warns both against pedigree worship and the morale hit from settling for true mediocrity.

- Comment pulse
    - There’s no universal “best” → hire for specific strengths; prioritize execution discipline and high‑agency generalists; filter out genuinely poor performers first.
    - Embrace dissent → top engineers challenge architecture and deadlines; build culture to harness pushback—counterpoint: needing “the best” may indicate unnecessary complexity.
    - Fix evaluation → junior teams mis-assess seniors; resume pedigree is weak; many greats skip standard funnels; many products only require competent engineers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat hiring like product-market fit: define must-haves, relax nice-to-haves, price competitively, and shorten time-to-hire.
    - Impact: Startups shift from pedigree filters to capability screens; expect more remote, mid-level, and nontraditional candidates in core teams.
    - Watch next: Track time-to-fill, first-90-days output, and retention by policy changes (comp bands, remote/hybrid, interview simplification) to calibrate tradeoffs.
