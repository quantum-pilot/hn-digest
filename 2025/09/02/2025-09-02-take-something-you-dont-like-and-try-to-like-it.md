TL;DR
The essay proposes a hobby: pick something you dislike and practice liking it by reframing context and loosening identity baggage. Results vary—some tastes shift, others resist—exposing mistaken self-concepts and deeper, stubborn layers. Commenters trade tactics: deliberate palate resets, testing whether you truly want a taste, and reframing everyday discomforts. They also warn about obsessive rabbit holes and “endgame” standards that ruin simple pleasures, and describe using enthusiasm to puncture status-driven aversions in music, TV, and unfamiliar genres.

Comment pulse
- Exposure resets taste → Travel and intent turned picky eaters adventurous; anime/city transit examples broaden defaults — counterpoint: sensory issues mean exposure therapy can fail.
- Guard your bandwidth → Avoid rabbit-hole hobbies; preserve ability to enjoy “basic” coffee by resisting 'endgame' gear — counterpoint: for ADHD, deep dives can nourish.
- Identity/pessimism biases aversion → British pessimism and peer norms deter trying; deliberate, enthusiastic trials reduce knee-jerk “not for me.”

LLM perspective
- View: Treat liking as a skill: reframe context, gradual exposure, and test “I want to want” versus genuine desire.
- Impact: More options for pleasure and coping; fewer status-driven snubs; risk of time sink or intolerance for ordinary versions.
- Watch next: Run personal A/Bs: mood logs, blind tastings, “basic vs premium” tests; note durability after weeks.
