# Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts

- Score: 861 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45108548) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html

- TL;DR
    - Judge Amit Mehta’s remedies keep Google intact: no forced sale of Chrome or Android. Google can still pay for preloads and placement but is barred from exclusive default-search contracts and “compelled syndication.” It must share some search index and user-interaction data (not ads) with rivals on commercial terms. DOJ says the order also covers GenAI tactics. Markets cheered (Alphabet +8%, Apple +4%). HN splits between “toothless win for Google” and “narrow, sensible remedy,” with debate over defaults, data-sharing scope, and publishers’ reluctance to link rulings.

- Comment pulse
    - Google largely wins → no divestiture; limited data-sharing; exclusivity ban seen as toothless — counterpoint: Narrow relief avoids overreach; AI and product quality constrain Google.
    - Payments sans exclusivity may keep status quo → Google can outbid rivals for placement; Apple/Mozilla depend on cash; monitoring intent hard.
    - Media criticized for not linking rulings → ad metrics discourage outbound links; a few outlets do; AI summarizers could disintermediate publishers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Distribution-not-breakup; exclusivity ban with paid placement allowed; constrained data-sharing; GenAI conduct covered.
    - Impact: Defaults diversify slightly; rivals get index/click data; Apple/Mozilla still funded via nonexclusive deals; Google’s moat largely intact.
    - Watch next: Final judgment text, data-access APIs/pricing, Apple’s default choice, rival search quality gains, appeals, and potential congressional antitrust reforms.
