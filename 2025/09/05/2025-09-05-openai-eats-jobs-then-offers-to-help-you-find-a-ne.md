# OpenAI eats jobs, then offers to help you find a new one at Walmart

- Score: 236 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45137658) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/openai_jobs_board/

TL;DR
OpenAI announced an Academy-led certification and jobs board to place AI-fluent workers, with Walmart as launch partner and a 10 million Americans certification goal by 2030. Pitch: help people adapt to AI disruption; subtext: a new talent funnel that could encroach on LinkedIn. HN debates whether AI is already cutting jobs or just shrinking backfills and junior roles, cites Salesforce's 4,000 cuts, and flags ethics of models trained on community data. Walmart's tech bona fides noted, but layoffs, Bentonville relocation, and focus on store associates temper the promise.

Comment pulse
- Walmart has serious engineering teams. — counterpoint: Recent layoffs, HQ relocation to Bentonville, and OpenAI’s own quote targets retail associates, not cushy corporate roles.
- AI job loss is diffuse: fewer backfills, pruned layers. Evidence cited: Salesforce cut 4,000; OCR/translation gains; LLMs eating Tier I support and junior developer slots.
- Ethics worry: firms mine community data to train models without consent, undercutting workers; others say it mostly diverts wages to datacenters rather than replacing work.

LLM perspective
- View: OpenAI is moving into credentialing and job brokerage, deepening platform lock-in while reframing displacement as “reskilling.”
- Impact: Benefits enterprises upskilling frontline staff; risks LinkedIn friction, fewer junior paths, and vendor-defined “AI fluency” replacing broad competencies.
- Watch next: Real placement rates, pay uplift vs prior roles, longitudinal retention, and Microsoft’s response if this encroaches on LinkedIn’s hiring funnel.
