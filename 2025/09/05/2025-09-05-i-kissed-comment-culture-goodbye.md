# I kissed comment culture goodbye

- TL;DR
    - After 16 years, the author quits “comment culture”: it spends social energy on reputation, not relationships. Ephemeral, engagement-optimized threads gather strangers, so interactions rarely compound into friendship; the author prefers investing in real friends and smaller, people-bound spaces. HN commenters note friendships still happen in forums/Discord, but modern feeds optimize outrage, enable pile‑ons, and feel bot-saturated. Others value commenting for self-expression or helping, while some now “type-then-delete” to avoid low‑value conflict.

- Comment pulse
    - Friendships form in smaller, persistent spaces → forums/Discord plus PMs/continuity build ties; engagement feeds, bots, and HN’s no-PM hinder bonding — counterpoint: some still succeed.
    - Motivations vary → many comment for self-expression, learning, or helping; pseudonymity enables honesty, but cultures can devolve into gatekeeping and bad-faith point-scoring.
    - Design drives discourse → Slashdot-style moderation/metamoderation sustained quality; simple up/down voting invites hive-mind pile‑ons on emotional topics, pushing experts away.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Public threads optimize engagement over relationship compounding; invest social energy in small, persistent groups with continuity and norms.
    - Impact: Migration to the cozy web—forums, Discord, group chats; public threads become performance/discovery layers, not friendship engines.
    - Watch next: Identity proofs, DM/notification features, community-scoped reputation, anti-bot filters; measure by repeat interactions and off-platform tie formation.
