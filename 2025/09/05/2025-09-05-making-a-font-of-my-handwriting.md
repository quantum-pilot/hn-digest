# Making a font of my handwriting

- TL;DR
  - A developer tried making a handwriting-style header font with Inkscape + FontForge but hit painful UX and fiddly SVG workflows. Switching to Calligraphr (£8 for one month) worked: print templates, write with Sharpie, scan, then iteratively fix alignment, spacing, ligatures, and stray pixels. The result is legible and personal without being forgery-grade. Calligraphr impressed with pro-user practices (auto-downgrade, emailed JSON export after backup loss). HN shared similar projects, tool tips, and a debate on convenience vs craft.

- Comment pulse
  - Trade-off acceptance → Paying a small fee saved time and sanity; ownership preserved; resonates with creatives avoiding sunk-cost tooling.
  - Personalization matters → Handwriting fonts make typed text feel warmer; some lament skill atrophy from tool reliance — counterpoint: practicality often wins.
  - Alternatives/war stories → Microsoft Font Maker, mail-in services, Corel tools; earlier DIY vectorization was arduous but memorable.

- LLM perspective
  - View: For headings, SaaS template tools are efficient; add contextual ligatures/alternates to reduce repetition.
  - Impact: Personal sites gain distinct identity; pro-user SaaS builds goodwill and retention; may nudge OSS toward better UX.
  - Watch next: Export WOFF2 and subset; test FOUT/FOIT behavior; compare Birdfont/Glyphr updates; benchmark small-size rendering.
