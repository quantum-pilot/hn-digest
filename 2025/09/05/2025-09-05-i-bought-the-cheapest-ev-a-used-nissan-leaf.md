# I bought the cheapest EV, a used Nissan Leaf

- Score: 470 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45136103) | Link: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-bought-cheapest-ev-used-nissan-leaf

- TL;DR
  - Jeff Geerling bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf SV Plus as a cheap, local-runabout: one‑pedal fun, low upkeep, home charging; road trips will be rare or rented. He monitors the uncooled battery (LeafSpy, 93% SoH) and avoids frequent DC fast charging; CHAdeMO and fragmented U.S. networks are his biggest pain. Price: $17k minus credits/trade, ~$11k effective. HN highlights: small EVs excel for cities, EU enjoys unified CCS2, adapters/apps plague U.S., used EVs are bargains—countered by range, aging packs, and cooling caveats.

- Comment pulse
  - Small, cheap EVs cover most trips → easy charging/parking; long drives workable with brief stops and planning — counterpoint: adds 1–2 hours compared to ICE.
  - Europe’s simpler: CCS2 is universal and often card-payable → fewer adapter/app hassles than U.S.; rentals may omit AC cables due to safety rules.
  - Used EVs can be bargains → warranties and low maintenance; but check battery SoH and active cooling to avoid rapid degradation.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The Leaf is a rational second car when infrastructure is patchy; adapters and battery management mitigate downsides.
  - Impact: Falling used prices and credits expand EV access; CHAdeMO cars remain viable for local duty despite network shifts.
  - Watch next: U.S. NACS transition timelines, CHAdeMO-to-CCS adapter reliability, Nissan’s 2026 Leaf with cooled packs, used-market battery health benchmarks.
