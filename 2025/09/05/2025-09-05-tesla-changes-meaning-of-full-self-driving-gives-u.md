# Tesla changes meaning of 'Full Self-Driving', gives up on promise of autonomy

- Score: 515 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45144900) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-changes-meaning-full-self-driving-give-up-promise-autonomy/

- TL;DR
  - Tesla redefined Full Self-Driving as “FSD (Supervised),” removing any promise of unsupervised autonomy and acknowledging 2016–2023 cars lack required hardware. A new CEO pay plan counts “10M Active FSD” under a vague definition that supervised FSD could satisfy, amid price cuts. HN debates allege bait‑and‑switch, potential securities/consumer fraud, refund obligations, and weak board governance. Many argue vision‑only is unsafe versus lidar/radar fusion; a minority report months of hands‑off success and expect Level‑4 soon.

- Comment pulse
  - Vision-only unsafe; redundancy needed. Rationale: phantom braking, false wiper triggers imply “hallucinations”; LiDAR/radar fusion adds depth, cross-checks, fewer edge-case failures — counterpoint: cost/design complexity.
  - Marketing shift equals fraud. Rationale: years of autonomy promises, now disclaimed; inflated valuation; calls for refunds, FTC/NHTSA action, and a non-captured board.
  - Vision-only works today. Rationale: some report months without interventions in Boston; extrapolate progress to Level 4 soon — skepticism: anecdotal, unbenchmarked.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Rebranding narrows liability and moves goalposts; subscriptions, not autonomy, become the KPI triggering colossal CEO compensation.
  - Impact: Regulatory probes, class-action heat, investor repricing; lidar-first rivals gain credibility while Tesla’s moat shifts to fleet data and cost.
  - Watch next: FTC/NHTSA moves; upgrade/refund specifics; standardized safety metrics; pricing or Autopilot bundling tweaks to boost “Active FSD” counts.
