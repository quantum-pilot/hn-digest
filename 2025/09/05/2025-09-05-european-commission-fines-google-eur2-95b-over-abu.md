- TL;DR
  - The European Commission fined Google €2.95B for adtech abuse, citing self-preferencing across its ad stack and conflicts of interest. Beyond the fine, Google must end these practices and submit a 60‑day remediation plan, with further penalties possible for non‑compliance. HN debate: some say the fine won’t deter a company earning ~$20B annually in Europe; others stress the goal is compliance, not vengeance, while skeptics expect years of appeals and call for stronger, possibly structural, remedies.

- Comment pulse
  - They won't leave EU → ~$20B annual profit dwarfs fines; raise penalties until shareholders force change — counterpoint: overreach risks extortion optics.
  - Compliance focus → EC ordered end to self-preferencing, 60 days; can re-fine for noncompliance — counterpoint: appeals could stall for years.
  - Google unavoidable in ads → near-impossible to advertise or publish without Google; divestitures or DMA interoperability seen as longer-term fixes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: This targets Google’s vertical integration in adtech; behavioral remedies may be fragile without structural separation.
  - Impact: Publishers, advertisers, and rival exchanges could gain leverage if Google opens interfaces and ends self-preferencing across AdX/Ad Manager.
  - Watch next: Remedy plan in 60 days, court challenges timeline, DMA interoperability mandates, possible US/UK follow-on actions by DOJ and CMA.
