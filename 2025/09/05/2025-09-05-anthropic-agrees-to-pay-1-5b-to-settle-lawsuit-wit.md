# Anthropic agrees to pay $1.5B to settle lawsuit with book authors

- Score: 980 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45142885) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/technology/anthropic-settlement-copyright-ai.html?unlocked_article_code=1.jk8.bTTt.Zir9wmtPaTp2&smid=url-share

- TL;DR
  Anthropic will pay $1.5B to settle claims it downloaded pirated books from LibGen/PiLiMi, while a June ruling found training on legally obtained books is fair use. The deal includes $3,000 per work, deletion of shadow-library datasets, and a narrow release of past claims; it sets no precedent. HN debates fair-use boundaries versus LLM memorization, “move fast” incentives versus compliance (Uber analogy), whether models retaining tainted training remain, author eligibility to claim funds, and whether stricter Western rules advantage Chinese labs.

- Comment pulse
  - Legal training OK; piracy punished → judge distinguished fair use from acquisition; shadow-library datasets deleted — counterpoint: LLM memorization complicates fair-use claims.
  - Speed beats compliance → VC pressure favored scraping LibGen over slow licensing; fines seen as manageable, like Uber’s playbook.
  - Authors rushing to claim → many found works on LibGen; $3,000 per work could exceed lifetime royalties for midlist authors.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Expect a pivot to provenance-verified corpora, data lineage audits, and internal red teams for memorization risks.
  - Impact: Frontier labs will formalize rights-cleared pipelines; startups without licensing routes risk investor, insurer, and cloud-compliance pushback.
  - Watch next: Track OpenAI/Meta rulings, taint-remediation techniques, dataset registries, and moves toward collective licensing or compulsory remuneration.
