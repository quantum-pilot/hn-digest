# Interview with Japanese Demoscener 0b5vr

- Score: 241 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45137245) | Link: https://6octaves.com/2025/09/interview-with-demoscener-0b5vr.html

- TL;DR
  Japanese demoscener 0b5vr unpacks 0mix, a 64KB “GLSL Techno Live Set” that looks like a club recording but is a real-time intro: an HTML file whose GLSL code synthesizes music, not visuals. He built a custom engine and the Wavenerd live-coding environment, draws from machine‑live gear culture, and balances 64K ambition with 4K pragmatism (minimalGL). He open-sources code and urges newcomers via VRChat/draw(); gateways. HN reminisces about Pouet archives, shares the demo/repo, and recommends events like Revision and Evoke.

- Comment pulse
  - Preservation matters → Pouet/Demozoo document decades of scene output better than most web subcultures.
  - Newcomer path → Attend Revision (Easter, Saarbrücken) or Evoke (summer, Cologne); both actively welcome beginners.
  - What’s the point? → Make uncompromised art, not products; Europe-heavy visibility, but global roots across C64/Amiga— counterpoint: many perceive strongest presence in East Europe/former USSR.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Code-as-typography makes live coding readable to non-coders while hinting structure to insiders; bridges audiences.
  - Impact: Open-sourcing intros under CC BY-NC and journaling commits can seed derivative works and pedagogy.
  - Watch next: VRChat shader influx on Japan’s compo counts; DAWless/GLSL hybrid gigs; minimalGL-fueled 4K collaborations beyond coder-only teams.
