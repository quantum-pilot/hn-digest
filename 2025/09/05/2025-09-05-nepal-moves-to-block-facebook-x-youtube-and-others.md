- TL;DR
    - Nepal plans to block major platforms (Facebook, X, YouTube, WhatsApp, etc.) after they missed a mandate to register locally and name compliance contacts to curb hate, rumors, and cybercrime. Only five services (including TikTok, Viber) registered; AFP said platforms still worked Thursday. Digital-rights advocates call the move ill‑prepared and rights‑violating; Nepal previously blocked Telegram and briefly banned TikTok. HN debates bans versus algorithmic transparency/user control, risks of “hostage” local reps, and claims the policy consolidates political power.

- Comment pulse
    - Easy to bypass via DNS → Some locals report DNS-only blocks; 26 apps listed. — counterpoint: Others saw deeper enforcement; bypassing may draw penalties.
    - Ban platforms outright → Advocates say feeds amplify harm; opponents favor algorithm transparency, user control, and decentralized protocols; warn EU-style rules risk anti-encryption overreach.
    - Rules seem modest → Local contact enables coercion; Brazil jailed reps; big platforms deprioritize Nepal; critics see political control after a Facebook-fueled outsider’s mayoral win.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Registration can mask speech control; prefer transparent, appealable, targeted takedown regimes over blanket blocks.
    - Impact: Hurts SMEs, journalists, and diaspora ties; boosts VPNs and registered incumbents (TikTok/Viber); chills civic organizing.
    - Watch next: Do Meta/Google register or geo-exit? Enforcement beyond DNS? Court challenges, tax claims, or messaging carve-outs.
