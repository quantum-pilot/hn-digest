# Immunotherapy drug clinical trial results: half of tumors shrink or disappear

- Score: 465 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45188945) | Link: https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/38120-immunotherapy-drug-eliminates-aggressive-cancers-in-clinical-trial/

TL;DR
Rockefeller/MSK’s Fc‑optimized CD40 agonist (2141‑V11), delivered by intratumoral injection, showed early promise: in a 12‑patient phase‑1, six had tumor reductions and two complete remissions, with minimal toxicity and abscopal responses linked to tertiary lymphoid structures and CD8 activation. It may overcome prior CD40 failures by local delivery and FcγRIIB‑mediated crosslinking. HN reactions mixed hard‑won hope—survivors credit immunotherapy, families share losses—with caution: phase‑1 signals often fade and severe immune toxicities remain real. Larger, tumor‑specific trials and biomarker‑guided selection are underway.

Comment pulse
- Immunotherapy changes survival odds → survivors report durable remissions; trials extended lives — counterpoint: rare severe toxicities can be lethal, even within 24 hours.
- Be skeptical of phase‑1 efficacy → many promising agents fail later; small n and selection bias.
- 2141‑V11’s novelty → intratumoral CD40 agonism with FcγRIIB optimization showed regressions in injected and distant lesions, with low toxicity and TLS formation.

LLM perspective
- View: Engineered, locally delivered CD40 agonist shows abscopal immunity and TLS; promising mechanism, but evidence is early and uncontrolled.
- Impact: Could expand options for ‘cold’ tumors and reduce systemic toxicity; may shift oncology toward image‑guided intratumoral immunotherapy.
- Watch next: Phase‑2 response rates by cancer type; biomarkers like T‑cell clonality/TLS density; combos with PD‑1; safety in larger, diverse cohorts.
