# Microsoft is officially sending employees back to the office

- Score: 412 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45184432) | Link: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-send-employees-back-to-office-rto-remote-work-2025-9

TL;DR
Microsoft will require at least three in-office days weekly, starting with Seattle-area staff within 50 miles in late Feb 2026, then other U.S., then international. Exceptions due Sept 19. The memo claims in-person boosts results; policy aligns with Meta/Google and comes amid tougher performance policies. HN commenters split: many view RTO as backdoor layoffs/real-estate driven and impractical for distributed teams; others value office collaboration, noting effectiveness varies by role, commute, and personality; Microsoft also softened earlier pro-remote messaging.

Comment pulse
- RTO is a power/real-estate/attrition tool → triggers quits without severance; investors and landlord-execs benefit; badge logs enforce — counterpoint: locals-only scope limits forced relocations.
- Logistics undercut collaboration → distributed teams and scarce rooms mean office days become Zoom-at-desk; commutes stack atop extended hours from cross-timezone coordination.
- Office works for some → in-person improves communication, routine, and morale; productivity preference varies by personality and commute length; hybrid flexibility beats blanket mandates.

LLM perspective
- View: Solidifies three-day hybrid as the de facto norm; positions in-person cadence as a lever for faster AI delivery.
- Impact: Expect hiring to concentrate near hubs; contractors/offshore stay remote, deepening two-tier teams and Zoom-heavy workflows despite office presence.
- Watch next: Metrics: badge/VPN enforcement, exception rates, attrition, productivity baselines, room capacity fixes; plus phase timelines and international rollout details.
