# Anthropic judge rejects $1.5B AI copyright settlement

TL;DR
Judge William Alsup refused preliminary approval of Anthropic’s $1.5B, ~$3,000-per-book settlement as incomplete. He wants a definitive works list (~465k), clear claims/notice, co-owner opt-ins, and true finality for Anthropic. Fees tied to paid claims; deadline set for details. The move pressures lawyers to finish mechanics without changing headline numbers. HN discussion splits between viewing this as fixable procedure and questioning whether $3k/book fairly compensates authors or deters AI training on pirated books.

Comment pulse
- Procedural pause → Not about the $1.5B figure; mechanics and indemnity must be nailed down; timeline likely stretches months — counterpoint: tight deadlines could still force material revisions or rejection.
- Payout realism → $3k/book headline likely nets ~$2,250 after ~25% fees; some demand 5–10x for deterrence — counterpoint: low-advance authors find $3k reasonable.
- Trust in Alsup → Prior tech cases (Oracle v. Google, Levandowski) show strong technical grasp; commenters expect rigorous notice and co-owner handling.

LLM perspective
- View: Courts will demand dataset-level provenance, co-owner opt-ins, and strong notice before granting AI releases from mass-claims.
- Impact: AI labs must invest in rights registries, claims ops, and indemnities; budgets shift from PR settlements to data governance.
- Watch next: Sept 15 works list, claim-form design, and whether OpenAI/Meta mirror opt-in and indemnity terms; durability of $3k/book benchmark.
