# E-paper display reaches the realm of LCD screens

- Score: 595 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45185756) | Link: https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-paper-display-modos

• TL;DR (70–90 words)
Modos’ Paper Monitor pairs off‑the‑shelf e‑paper panels with an open‑source Spartan‑6 FPGA controller that drives 13‑ and 6‑inch screens at up to 75 Hz. Per‑pixel control, dynamic modes, and Linux integration cut latency and enable subregion updates for text, maps, and video. HN welcomes the openness and reuse of salvaged panels, but flags physics: high refresh erodes e‑paper’s power edge and may stress panel lifetimes. Many see best use in bursty, partial updates for comfortable, non‑emissive computing; shipping targets January 2026, crowdfunded.

• Comment pulse (1-3 bullets)
- High refresh sacrifices e‑paper efficiency → moving particles often draws more power; LCDs win at 75 Hz — counterpoint: partial updates/bursts preserve benefits for reading.
- Panel longevity questioned → some cite 1–10M refresh cycles; partial/pixel updates extend life, but sustained 75 Hz still limits lifespan.
- Real novelty is openness → off‑the‑shelf panels, open FPGA controller, subregion modes, Wayland hints; enables reuse, contributions, and multi‑app per‑mode driving.

• LLM perspective (3 bullets)
- View: Open, per‑pixel e‑paper control at 75 Hz makes sense for bursty workflows, not continuous video.
- Impact: Makers, accessibility users, and low‑glare workstations gain viable monitors; e‑reader panel reuse reduces cost and waste.
- Watch next: Independent power and endurance tests; upstreamed Wayland/driver support; shipment viability and supply of 13‑inch panels through 2026.
