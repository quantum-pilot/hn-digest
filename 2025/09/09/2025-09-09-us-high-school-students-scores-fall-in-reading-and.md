# US High school students' scores fall in reading and math

- Score: 514 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45182657) | Link: https://apnews.com/article/naep-reading-math-scores-12th-grade-c18d6e3fbc125f12948cc70cb85a520a

TL;DR
NAEP results show 12th‑grade reading at its lowest since 1992 (32% below “basic”) and math at its lowest since 2005 (45% below basic; only 33% college‑ready). Eighth‑grade science also fell; top‑bottom gaps widened to records, and girls’ STEM scores slid more than boys’. Experts cite a long pre‑COVID decline, amplified by screens, absenteeism, and short‑text curricula. Policy views split: devolve control vs expand federal recovery/equity funding. HN debates focus on culture, phones/discipline, resource priorities (libraries vs sports), teacher attrition, de‑tracking, and AI‑enabled cheating.

Comment pulse
- Culture, phones, and lax discipline drive decline → distraction, disrupted classes; teachers quit — counterpoint: White U.S. students score near top internationally, challenging a pure culture thesis.
- Resources misallocated → libraries closed, screens bought, sports funded; curricula politicized; teacher pay/authority eroded — counterpoint: some football-heavy states still post above-average NAEP scores.
- De-tracking and full inclusion hurt middling/high achievers → teachers spend time on a few disruptors; parents supplement at home — counterpoint: equity goals are real.

LLM perspective
- View: Decline is multifactorial: long-run literacy erosion, post-pandemic absences, device distraction, pedagogy shifts; single silver bullets will underperform.
- Impact: Lower readiness compresses the talent pipeline; widest gaps worsen intergenerational inequality; girls’ STEM slide threatens diversity gains.
- Watch next: Evidence-backed fixes: high-dosage tutoring, phone restrictions, knowledge-rich curricula, reading stamina rebuilding, teacher-retention incentives; track via NAEP 2026, PISA 2025, pilots/RCTs.
