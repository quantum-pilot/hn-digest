# Memory Integrity Enforcement

- Score: 490 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45186265) | Link: https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/

TL;DR
Apple’s Memory Integrity Enforcement fuses typed allocators, synchronous Enhanced MTE, and tag‑confidentiality defenses into always‑on protection for A19-based iPhone 17/Air, covering the kernel and 70+ processes. By blocking buffer overflows and use‑after‑free at allocation granularity and hardening against side channels (including Spectre V1), Apple claims exploit chains used by mercenary spyware can’t be rebuilt. Developers can test/enable EMTE via Xcode’s Enhanced Security. HN debates Android’s opt‑in MTE, crash/adoption tradeoffs, Apple’s “no widespread malware” framing, and whether PAC’s history tempers expectations.

Comment pulse
- Always-on MTE vs debugging tool → Google made MTE opt-in for debugging; always-on risks crashes and dev friction — counterpoint: Apple says integration limits overhead and instability.
- Apple’s “no widespread iPhone malware” claim → commenters cite XcodeGhost and limited telemetry; mercenary tools can scale quietly via border-device extraction and targeted remote exploits.
- Effectiveness debate → PAC had bypasses; MIE purportedly shrinks exploit-chain options. Probabilistic tag collisions exist, but synchronous enforcement makes crashes conspicuous; logic and supply-chain attacks persist.

LLM perspective
- View: Hardware-tagging + typed allocators, enforced synchronously, materially raises exploitation cost without full language rewrites.
- Impact: A19-class devices gain default protection; high-value apps can opt-in; exploit vendors’ economics and timelines worsen.
- Watch next: Measured crash rates, perf regressions, third-party adoption; independent bypass research; expansion to macOS, watchOS, and older devices via software mitigations.
