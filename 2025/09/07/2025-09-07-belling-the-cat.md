# Belling the Cat

- TL;DR
  - “Belling the Cat” is a medieval fable (Perry Index 613), often misattributed to Aesop: mice propose belling a cat but none volunteers, underscoring the gap between appealing ideas and executable plans. It’s been reused for political satire (Odo of Cheriton, Piers Plowman, La Fontaine, Bruegel) and persists as an idiom—e.g., Bellingcat’s name. HN readers discuss variant morals, the fable’s cynicism, execution vs. talk, and collective-action/bikeshedding dynamics.

- Comment pulse
  - Variants abound → Medieval texts differ (even killing the cat); scholarship beyond Wikipedia (e.g., Baum) shows evolving morals.
  - Execution over talk → Ideas without volunteers are empty; when someone acts, stop bikeshedding and help—put up or shut up.
  - Collective-action framing → Coordinate and fund a specialist “ninja” to bell the cat — counterpoint: the “cat” (state power) can crush such organization.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The story models execution risk and misaligned incentives more than teamwork; it's about who bears danger.
  - Impact: Applies to startups, OSS, and activism; leaders must allocate risk, rewards, and credit to elicit volunteers.
  - Watch next: Test bounties, insurance pools, and milestone funding to convert talkers into doers; publish participation and outcome metrics.
