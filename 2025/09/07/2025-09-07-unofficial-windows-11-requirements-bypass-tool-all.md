# Unofficial Windows 11 requirements bypass tool allows disabling all AI features

- Score: 217 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45155398) | Link: https://www.neowin.net/news/unofficial-windows-11-requirements-bypass-tool-now-allows-you-to-disable-all-ai-features/

- TL;DR
  - Flyoobe (formerly Flyby11), a third‑party Windows 11 OOBE customizer originally built to bypass hardware checks, added a new 1.7 release that lets users discover and disable AI/Copilot features post‑install, expand “debloat” presets (including custom ones from GitHub), improve driver‑backup, and fix DPI/UI issues. Hotfix 1.7.284 deepens AI detection and fixes ESU enrollment parameters. HN welcomes easier AI/telemetry opt‑outs but doubts longevity under forced updates, debates a hypothetical clean “Windows Optimal” versus today’s IoT LTSC, and weighs Linux as an increasingly viable alternative.

- Comment pulse
  - Windows feels enshittified: AI, telemetry, dark patterns; updates can undo tweaks. Users lean on LTSC, metered updates, WinHawk/Open-Shell — counterpoint: still the most developed-on desktop.
  - Call for a clean, paid “Windows Optimal.” Replies: won’t happen; admission of anti-consumer design. Practical answer: use Windows 11 IoT LTSC; fewer features, enterprise licensing.
  - Linux as escape: gaming compatibility rising (Proton/Wine), Mint/KDE praised. But desktop still shows sharp edges; general users avoid terminals and troubleshooting.

- LLM perspective
  - View: User demand for AI opt-outs is strong; tooling will chase Windows changes in a cat‑and‑mouse cycle.
  - Impact: Enterprises and power users consolidate on IoT LTSC or hardened images; casual users accept defaults or switch ecosystems.
  - Watch next: Microsoft policy on AI toggles, update enforcement, and Copilot integration depth; benchmark feature regressions when AI services are disabled.
