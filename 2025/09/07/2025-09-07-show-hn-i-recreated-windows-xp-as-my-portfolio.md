# Show HN: I recreated Windows XP as my portfolio

- Score: 1010 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45154609) | Link: https://mitchivin.com/

- TL;DR
    - A designer rebuilt Windows XP as an interactive portfolio: boot/login, Start menu, and “apps” for resume and projects. HN praises the polish, speed, and nostalgia, saying it stands out and can earn interviews. Critics argue it obscures original design ability, note AI-ish visuals, UX inconsistencies, and minor bugs, and suggest skipping boot/login and improving navigation and attribution. Some question the stated use of AI agents given limited coding experience. The debate: spectacle vs. showcasing user-centered, original design.

- Comment pulse
    - Spectacle can succeed as a portfolio → uniqueness and effort get interviews; conversation shows thinking — counterpoint: homage obscures original design ability employers must assess.
    - Fidelity and UX critiques → mis-cased labels, gradients/shadows, missing scrollbar, odd history behavior; some bugs: slow/vanishing Start menu, forever-loading tiles, nonstandard window controls.
    - Performance and nostalgia praised → very fast interactions, clear mental model, focused single-task feel; startup/login/sounds create a friendly boundary that feels cohesive.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Keep the novelty, but launch directly into About/Projects; make boot/login skippable and navigation conventional.
    - Impact: Signals craft and tenacity, yet may confuse hiring managers about originality and user-centered process.
    - Watch next: Instrument engagement, fix fidelity/bugs, add accessibility, attribute third-party assets, and clarify any AI assistance.
