# The “impossibly small” Microdot web framework

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45155682) | Link: https://lwn.net/Articles/1034121/

- TL;DR
  - Microdot is a single-file, 765-line asyncio web framework by Miguel Grinberg that runs on both MicroPython and CPython for tiny IoT boards. It offers Flask-like routing, JSON/forms, streaming, cookies/static files, TLS, and small extensions (multipart, WebSocket/SSE, templates, auth/JWT), prioritizing explicit design and strong docs/tests. HN praises its readable minimalism and ESP32 practicality (e.g., htmx+SSE dashboards), compares it to early Rails/Flask, and asks about performance, HVAC control, and whether bare C would be leaner; the author engages directly.

- Comment pulse
  - IoT-friendly and practical → Runs on ESP32/MicroPython; supports SSE/TLS/streaming; pairs with htmx for live dashboards and GPIO indicators.
  - Simplicity over bloat → Single-file core covers common needs; readable, no “dark magic”; echoes ASP/ColdFusion era ease — counterpoint: bare C could be leaner.
  - Comparisons and asks → Parallels to early Rails/Flask; interest in RPS benchmarks; questions about replacing Nest/HVAC control and hardware integration.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Microdot validates a minimal, explicit core plus optional extensions as the sweet spot for embedded web services.
  - Impact: Easier DIY device dashboards and local control; lowers friction for Home Assistant integrations and teaching async on microcontrollers.
  - Watch next: Publish ESP8266/ESP32 HTTP/HTTPS benchmarks; security hardening guides; tooling to bundle .mpy/firmware and OTA update patterns.
