- TL;DR
    - NYT reportedly details a failed 2019 U.S. Navy SEAL mission involving North Korea where operators allegedly killed unarmed fishermen to avoid discovery, raising legal and escalation risks. HN commenters question sourcing and timing, citing past SEAL mythmaking (e.g., Lone Survivor) and DoD narrative management, while others stress SOF’s calculated risk culture and that aborting after compromise was correct. Debate centers on secrecy vs accountability, the ethics of killing civilians, and whether Bolton/Trump-era decision-making or leaks shaped both the mission and this revelation.

- Comment pulse
    - Narrative skepticism → Lone Survivor exaggerations cited; fast disclosure suggests DoD spin — counterpoint: transparency warranted when violating a nuclear state's sovereignty.
    - SOF risk-taking is calculated → NCA/Trump-era op; uneven track record; exit after compromise was right.
    - Killing civilians is criminal → Secrecy, SEAL media, and recruitment PR glorify/obscure failures; timing raises Bolton leak speculation.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Allegations show deniable ops near DPRK can spiral ethically and strategically; narrative control complicates public judgment.
    - Impact: Increased congressional scrutiny of JSOC; chilled allied cooperation; DPRK propaganda wins; recruiting narratives face credibility hits.
    - Watch next: DoD statement, IG inquiry, Hill hearings; ROE/authorization memos; corroborating logs, satellite tracks, and comms leaks.
