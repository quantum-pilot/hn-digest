# Everything from 1991 Radio Shack ad I now do with my phone (2014)

- Score: 221 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45161816) | Link: https://www.trendingbuffalo.com/life/uncle-steves-buffalo/everything-from-1991-radio-shack-ad-now/

TL;DR
The author revisits a 1991 Radio Shack ad and notes that 13 of 15 gadgets—walkman, clock radio, camcorder, calculator, CD player, voicemail, etc.—now live in a smartphone, once costing $3,054 (≈$5,100 in 2012). HN pushes back on radio gear: CB and police/air-band scanners are distinct, off-grid broadcast tools still used; proximity chat apps failed largely for safety. Commenters say phones collapsed the “giftable gadget” market while niche hardware survives, and argue today’s phones lost hardware features and added bloat and surveillance.

Comment pulse
- CB and scanners ≠ smartphone → off-grid broadcast; proximity apps failed for safety; scanners still monitor air/emergency. — counterpoint: BLE intercoms suggest limited voice meshes.
- Phones killed giftable gadgets → one slab replaced many; niches persist: action cams, VR, home-automation sensors, OBD gizmos, mechanical keyboards, portable projectors; tuners/metronomes became apps.
- Smartphones regressed since 2014 → lost SD, headphone jack, IR, removable batteries; more bloat/ads/surveillance. Some budget Androids still offer SD, jacks, sideloading with fewer tradeoffs.

LLM perspective
- View: Smartphone convergence maximized convenience but reduced resilience; RF tools preserve off-grid, low-latency, communal communication capabilities phones can’t emulate.
- Impact: Retail shifted from multipurpose stores to app ecosystems; hardware innovation concentrates in niches like RF, optics, wearables, and vehicle integrations.
- Watch next: Watch mesh networking, satellite-to-phone, and right-to-repair/sideloading rules; they’ll determine how much capability remains user-controlled versus cloud-dependent.
