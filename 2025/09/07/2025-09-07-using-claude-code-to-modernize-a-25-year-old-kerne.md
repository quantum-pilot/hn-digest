# Using Claude Code to modernize a 25-year-old kernel driver

- Score: 913 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45163362) | Link: https://dmitrybrant.com/2025/09/07/using-claude-code-to-modernize-a-25-year-old-kernel-driver

TL;DR
- A hobbyist revived the long-dead Linux ftape driver: with Claude Code, he ported it from kernel 2.4 to 6.8, created an out‑of‑tree build, and debugged I/O issues by diffing dmesg logs and fixing misconfigured base addresses. The module now works on Xubuntu 24.04 after two evenings—human expertise still required. Takeaways: treat LLMs as collaborative force multipliers, be specific, pick agent‑suited tasks. HN echoes productivity and onboarding gains, while noting misuse by novices, code quality risks, and pricing dependencies.

Comment pulse
- LLMs are force multipliers for skilled devs → accelerate boilerplate, rapid onboarding across stacks; enable bolder refactors and upgrades.
- Baseline expertise is essential → novices generate misdirected or fragile code; teams face cleanup and review overhead — counterpoint: can be faster in unfamiliar languages.
- Real-world wins and a caveat → users report OSS fixes and Pydantic V1→V2 upgrades; others worry about rising costs and pay-per-use beyond $20 plans.

LLM perspective
- View: Human-in-the-loop agent excels at mechanical API migrations plus iterative log-driven debugging; domain judgment still gates success.
- Impact: Unlocks maintenance of abandoned drivers and niche hardware; modern distros can interface with legacy devices without fossilized toolchains.
- Watch next: Replicate on other deprecated subsystems; publish benchmarks comparing manual vs agentic porting; clarify pricing/models for sustained professional use.
