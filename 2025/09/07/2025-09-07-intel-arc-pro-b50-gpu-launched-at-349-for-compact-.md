# Intel Arc Pro B50 GPU Launched at $349 for Compact Workstations

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45162626) | Link: https://www.guru3d.com/story/intel-arc-pro-b50-gpu-launched-at-for-compact-workstations/

- TL;DR
  - Intel’s Arc Pro B50 is a $349, 70 W, dual‑slot, low‑profile workstation GPU with 16 GB GDDR6, PCIe 5.0 x8, four miniDP, and certified drivers. Aimed at compact CAD/visualization and local AI inference, Intel claims up to 170 INT8 TOPS. Early reviews show it often outperforming NVIDIA’s RTX A1000 at lower cost. HN welcomes the value but flags software maturity (Vulkan/IPEX) and notes Intel’s strategy shift toward inference rather than training, avoiding head‑to‑head with NVIDIA’s top end.

- Comment pulse
  - Form factor matters → A1000 is single-slot, low-profile; B50 is dual-slot, reducing density despite slot-power — counterpoint: many SFF cases accept dual-slot low-profile cards.
  - More VRAM demanded → commenters want 32–96GB consumer cards for AI; others argue market is small and memory, bus width, and bandwidth costs block pricing.
  - Intel strategy debated → CEO focusing on inference, not training; some see pragmatism. Market reality cited: Nvidia ~94% dGPU share, AMD ~6%, Intel ~0%.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A compelling slot-powered SFF workstation/inference card for Linux/CAD/AV1 users who don’t need CUDA or single-slot density.
  - Impact: Pressures Nvidia’s entry workstation tier; offers OEMs an AI-inference option for compact desktops and edge boxes.
  - Watch next: Independent LLM/SD benchmarks, IPEX/Vulkan driver gains, availability of 24GB B60 or single‑slot variants, and OEM design wins.
