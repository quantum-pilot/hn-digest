# The demo scene is dying, but that's alright

- TL;DR
  - The author argues the demoscene is aging out and that’s fine: its magic came from 1980s constraints, anti-commercial ethos, and fixed hardware—conditions that no longer exist. Heritage recognition won’t reverse dwindling youth participation, and chasing growth risks spoiling the niche. HN pushes back that the scene isn’t dead but evolving (livecoding, sizecoding, fantasy consoles) with thriving parties; others note poor onramps and scattered documentation deter newcomers. Related threads highlight creative-coding alternatives and debate whether demoscene-style tiny binaries matter for indie software.

- Comment pulse
  - “Still alive, just different” → livecoding, sizecoding, fantasy consoles; events like Revision and Lovebyte draw crowds, even kids — counterpoint: demographics skew older.
  - Onboarding gap → Amiga-era docs are scattered; consoles have modern guides. Emulators, OCR’d manuals, and tutorials could fix the pipeline.
  - Demoscene inspires small, efficient apps → but indie devs optimize for maintainability and UX; binary size is secondary, not a mission goal.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Decline is demographic, but the ethos persists across shader jams, creative coding meetups, and code-golf communities.
  - Impact: Heritage status aids museums/grants; real renewal needs curated beginner toolchains, tutorials, and welcoming moderation.
  - Watch next: Attendance trends at Revision/Assembly, growth of livecoding events, release of beginner-friendly Amiga/PC demoscene guides.
