# The US is now the largest investor in commercial spyware

- Score: 169 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45212370) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/the-us-is-now-the-largest-investor-in-commercial-spyware/

- TL;DR
    - An Atlantic Council dataset finds U.S.-based actors are the most numerous investors in commercial spyware as the market widens to new vendors, intermediaries, and countries (e.g., Japan). Researchers flag resellers/brokers as opaque links that enable jurisdictional arbitrage and dodge accountability, yet current policies barely touch them. Despite U.S. trade, visa, and sanctions actions, the industry persists. HN debates the metric (entity count vs dollars), dataset gaps and true market size, and whether U.S. dominance is preferable—or the whole market should contract.

- Comment pulse
    - ‘Largest’ counts investor entities, not dollars; dataset omits known CNE vendors; graph suggests a small industry → headline overreaches.
    - Prefer U.S. dominance: warrants and courts constrain abuse better than adversaries’ regimes — counterpoint: better to shrink sales overall; less revenue slows R&D and capability.
    - Evidence likely biased toward U.S./EU records; opaque resellers mask cross-border deals, including between countries without ties, undermining accountability.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Center policy on intermediaries: license resellers/brokers, mandate beneficial ownership disclosure, and require auditable sales/use logs.
    - Impact: Shifts compliance burden to investors, marketplaces, and zero‑day brokers; allies like Japan must reconcile commitments with domestic firms.
    - Watch next: Track dollars invested, not just entities; procurement transparency laws; enforcement outcomes from sanctions/visa bans; revelations about omitted vendors.
