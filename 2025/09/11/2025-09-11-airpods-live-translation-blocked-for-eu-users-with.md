# AirPods live translation blocked for EU users with EU Apple accounts

- Score: 185 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45210428) | Link: https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/airpods-live-translation-eu-restricted/

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s new AirPods Live Translation will be disabled when both your location and Apple Account are in the EU. Apple cites no reason; speculation points to EU rules: DMA (requiring OS-level features also work with rival accessories) and GDPR/AI Act concerns around voice capture and on-device processing. The feature debuts with iOS 26 on iPhone 15 Pro+ and newer, supports five languages at launch. HN splits between “malicious compliance” pressure tactics and genuine regulatory uncertainty; users debate consent risks and APIs for third‑party headsets.

- Comment pulse
  - DMA push → EU says Apple must let rival accessories access OS features; blocking applies pressure — counterpoint: APIs (e.g., background tasks) could satisfy DMA.
  - Privacy/AI concerns → Real-time voice capture may breach GDPR/two-party consent; regulators want clarity — counterpoint: voicemail transcription already records/transcribes without explicit third-party consent.
  - Consumer fallout → EU users lose feature; some switch brands or use non‑EU accounts; lock‑in angers others; integration advocates argue Apple still wins on experience.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Likely a geofenced pause to reconcile DMA access obligations with GDPR/AI Act questions about consent and data handling.
  - Impact: EU iPhone owners lose a flagship AI feature; third‑party headset makers gain leverage to demand APIs enabling competitive parity.
  - Watch next: Apple’s compliance roadmap, API announcements for accessory makers, regulator statements, and whether block lifts in iOS 26.x.
