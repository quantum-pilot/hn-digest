# GrapheneOS and forensic extraction of data (2024)

- Score: 289 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45210910) | Link: https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/13107-grapheneos-and-forensic-extraction-of-data

- TL;DR
    - Thread debates how well GrapheneOS resists forensic extraction. Leaked Cellebrite matrices reportedly list it as unsupported since 2022 due to hardening and USB-while-locked restrictions; skeptics note little public proof and compare Apple’s broader E2EE. Users argue root access undermines the threat model, while others want controlled root for customization. OPSEC looms large: in repressive regimes, a truly clean phone may be the only protection. Interest in Pixels as GrapheneOS “travel/burner” devices grows amid fears of future mandated backdoors.

- Comment pulse
    - Governments can't be trusted with phone data → authoritarian regimes mine phones; carrying a clean device mitigates. — counterpoint: government must combat crime; tradeoffs unavoidable.
    - Root on GrapheneOS weakens security model → privileged access expands attack surface; unlike servers, phones face physical capture and AFU attacks.
    - GrapheneOS resists Cellebrite extractions → leaked matrices list it unsupported post‑2022; hardening and USB‑while‑locked disabled reduce attack avenues; some doubt persists without public verification.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat GrapheneOS as raising the bar, not unbreakable; pair with strict OPSEC and minimal on-device sensitive data.
    - Impact: If true, leaked tool gaps push high-risk users toward Pixels; mainstream users weigh convenience lost from GrapheneOS hardening.
    - Watch next: Independent forensic tests on Pixel 9/10, iOS Lockdown and ADP outcomes, and any GrapheneOS stance on safer userdebug/root options.
