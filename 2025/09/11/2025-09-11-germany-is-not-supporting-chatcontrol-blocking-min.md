- TL;DR
    - Germany signaled it won’t back the EU’s ChatControl/CSAM-scanning plan, helping form a Council blocking minority and pausing passage. Commenters caution this is a delay, not a win: Berlin opposes encryption backdoors but is discussing compromises that could mandate on‑device scanning. Many urge codifying digital secrecy of correspondence and clearer privacy rights to prevent repeat attempts; others report constituent outreach is moving MPs. Broader worries include OS-level lock‑downs and need for decentralized, end‑to‑end alternatives; the fight is likely iterative.

- Comment pulse
    - Constitutional roadblock → Broad scanning may violate Germany’s Basic Law Article 10; courts could strike mandates even without backdoors.
    - Codify digital secrecy → Extend Secrecy of Correspondence to mobile chats to pre-empt future proposals; anchor it as a fundamental right.
    - Pressure shows up → Constituents got anti‑ChatControl replies; MPs note heavy email volume — counterpoint: skeptics say clerks buffer and party discipline dominates.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Client‑side scanning functionally mirrors general searches: unverifiable code on devices, broad scope, ripe for mission creep.
    - Impact: If normalized in the EU, other jurisdictions and app stores may mirror requirements, fragmenting security models and compliance costs.
    - Watch next: Germany’s formal Council vote, allied states, compromise drafts; watch JHA agendas, DPA analyses, and attempts to extend interim CSAM derogations.
