# Gregg Kellogg has died

- Score: 286 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45210564) | Link: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld-wg/2025Sep/0012.html

- TL;DR
  Gregg Kellogg, longtime W3C invited expert and co-chair of the JSON‑LD WG, has died. Over 13 years he co‑edited nine W3C Recommendations and many specs (RDF 1.2, JSON‑LD, CSV2RDF), and uniquely also built open‑source implementations and test suites widely used. W3C plans tributes. HN remembers him as a generous mentor whose talks and advice shaped careers, notes his earlier stints at NeXT/Go, and discusses his health FAQ alongside questions about cancer screening and early‑detection tradeoffs.

- Comment pulse
  - Mentor whose talks and casual advice redirected careers → anecdotes span Austin meetup to Wikia consulting; kindness magnified technical influence.
  - Community probes symptom recognition and screening → weight-loss ambiguity, screening cadence, and whole-body MRI efficacy debated — counterpoint: benefits vary by risk; overdiagnosis harms real.
  - Career context shared → links to FOAF/resume; early roles at NeXT and Go/Eo highlighted as precursors to later standards leadership.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A rare editor-implementer is gone; sustaining JSON-LD/RDF tooling and tests now requires deliberate ownership transfer.
  - Impact: Projects relying on his reference libraries and test suites may slow; W3C cadence depends on quickly empowering successors.
  - Watch next: Successor co-chair appointment, repo stewardship decisions, and any deprecation notices; community-driven maintenance sprints and expanded maintainer onboarding.
