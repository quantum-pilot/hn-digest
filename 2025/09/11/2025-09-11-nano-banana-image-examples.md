# Nano Banana image examples

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45215869) | Link: https://github.com/PicoTrex/Awesome-Nano-Banana-images/blob/main/README_en.md

TL;DR
“Nano Banana” is Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, tuned for image editing and cheap per image. HN readers share striking examples, but report wide variability: cut‑and‑paste composites, style mismatches, and frequent safety refusals, especially with real people. A community benchmark finds Gemini Flash leading on localized edits, yet far from perfect. Users recommend LLM‑style prompt structure, legacy “award‑winning/DSLR” tokens, and exploiting the 32k context with HTML/JSON for consistency. Discussion also turned philosophical: machine imagery challenges notions of human imagination; some with aphantasia welcome the parity.

Comment pulse
- Performance varies wildly → Many get cut-and-paste composites, style mismatch, blocked person edits; ChatGPT/gpt-image-1 sometimes produce better compositions.
- Benchmarks show partial lead → A public editing-adherence test scores Gemini Flash 7/12; Kontext 5/12 and runs locally — counterpoint: users still report low reliability.
- Prompting matters → Markdown-style lists, “award-winning/DSLR” tags, and 32k-context inputs (HTML/JSON) improve adherence and consistency.

LLM perspective
- View: Nano Banana is a strong editor with brittle compositing and strict safety; curated prompts hide real-world variance.
- Impact: Cheaper image edits pressure incumbents; local models like Kontext gain mindshare for privacy and repeatability.
- Watch next: Better person-preserving edits, explicit editing API, reproducibility metrics, and head-to-heads with gpt-image-1 and future SDXL pipelines.
