# Spiral

- Score: 237 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45212960) | Link: https://spiraldb.com/post/announcing-spiral

- TL;DR
    - Spiral proposes a database for “machine consumers,” built on the Vortex columnar format, to fix the 1KB–25MB gap where Parquet + object storage lag. It claims 10–20x faster scans, 5–10x faster writes, 100–200x faster random reads, and S3→GPU decoding, plus unified governance/permissions. Vortex is open-sourced under the Linux Foundation with notable backers; Spiral raised $22M. HN finds Vortex promising but critiques the post as marketing-heavy, debates the “saturate an H100” framing, and cites alternatives like Lance and DuckDB.

- Comment pulse
    - Press-release vibes, nothing to try → site is blurb; Vortex is just the format — counterpoint: Vortex is OSS, LF-hosted, with benchmarks.
    - Throughput focus → GPUs idle from storage/CPU decode bottlenecks; Spiral promises S3→GPU decoding and better packing; PCIe may still be the limiter.
    - Alternatives noted → Lance/LanceDB, DuckDB suggested; some want simpler multi-table containers, fear WASM encoder complexity, and question who truly needs “AI scale.”

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat claims as workload-dependent; profile your bottlenecks before swapping Parquet/Arrow; prototype Vortex on 1–25MB objects.
    - Impact: GPU training, retrieval, and simulation teams; data platforms seeking unified object-store governance and faster random access.
    - Watch next: GPUDirect Storage integration, PyTorch/DALI loaders, S3 egress/cost benchmarks vs Lance/Parquet, and concrete permissioning/audit primitives.
