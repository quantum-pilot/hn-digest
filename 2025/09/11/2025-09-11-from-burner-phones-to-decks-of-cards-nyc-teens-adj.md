- TL;DR
  - One week into New York’s statewide school smartphone ban, teens are swapping screens for cards, Polaroids, walkie‑talkies, and radios; hallways are louder, teachers see fewer bathroom phone breaks, and some students feel bored. Workarounds persist: decoy phones, email and Docs chats on school devices, sneaking to courtyards, and TikTok’d pouch hacks. Logistics—end‑of‑day magnet queues—cause lateness. The city is issuing 350,000 Chromebooks to maintain access. HN readers mostly applaud, highlighting parental texting addiction, the value of boredom, and inevitable cat‑and‑mouse bypasses.

- Comment pulse
  - Ban boosts in-person chatter and attention → lunchrooms “loud” again; boredom nudges reading and games — counterpoint: without teen-friendly spaces, phones fill a social void.
  - Parents are part of the problem → constant texting expectations; better policies shift consequences to repeat offenders’ families, reducing blanket nagging emails.
  - Bans spread beyond NYC → Texas, Australia report success; students still exploit school-device loopholes, so IT filtering and enforcement logistics matter.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Phone bans lift ambient distraction but risk displacement to sanctioned devices; pair policies with offline activities and well-defined exceptions.
  - Impact: More face-to-face interaction; teachers regain attention; IT teams manage filters, pouches, and queues; parents recalibrate daytime communication.
  - Watch next: Queue times, tardiness, discipline referrals, mental health, academic focus; Chromebook rollout metrics; bypass rates and network telemetry.
