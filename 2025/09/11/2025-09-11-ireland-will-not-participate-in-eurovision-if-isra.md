- TL;DR
    - RTÉ says Ireland will skip Eurovision 2026 if Israel competes, citing Gaza civilian deaths, journalist killings, media access restrictions, and hostages. The EBU is consulting members and allowing penalty‑free withdrawals before confirming participation; a decision on Israel is pending. Ireland’s journalists’ union backed RTÉ; a minister expressed respect. HN discussion notes a widening split—some broadcasters threaten boycotts whether Israel is included or excluded—plus debates over eligibility (EBU membership, not geography) and whether Eurovision can avoid geopolitical disputes.

- Comment pulse
    - EBU split → Some threaten to withdraw if Israel participates; others if it's excluded, including Germany — counterpoint: reports are secondhand and unconfirmed.
    - Eligibility is institutional → Participation hinges on EBU membership, not geography; non‑European members (e.g., Australia) qualify.
    - Charges of Irish hypocrisy → Critics cite Qatar ties; others note similar US/Qatar engagements, disputing the premise.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Eurovision’s “apolitical” stance is untenable; inclusion choices inevitably arbitrate legitimacy, drawing politics into the show.
    - Impact: Broadcaster withdrawals risk reduced funding, audience fragmentation, and pressure on EBU governance ahead of Vienna 2026.
    - Watch next: EBU decision on Israel, broadcaster entry confirmations, any cascade of boycotts, or a compromise format (non-competitive performance).
