# Court rejects Verizon claim that selling location data without consent is legal

- Score: 635 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45206567) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/court-rejects-verizon-claim-that-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal/

TL;DR
- The Second Circuit ruled Verizon illegally shared device-location data without verified consent, rejecting its claim that Section 222 covers only call-location. The court cited 2018 abuses via Securus that enabled warrantless access and held device location is CPNI obtained via the carrier relationship. Verizon’s Seventh Amendment claim failed because it could have refused payment and sought a jury in a collection action—unlike the 5th Circuit’s AT&T ruling. HN commenters decry trivial fines, want tougher penalties, and note the ruling targets carriers, not apps/automakers.

Comment pulse
- Fines are trivial vs profits; data sales likely net-positive; demand bigger, enforceable penalties. — counterpoint: injury unclear and tariffs may block class actions.
- Ruling targets carriers under Section 222; doesn’t reach apps, automakers, or ISPs; “telecommunications service” often limited to voice, leaving many location leaks unaddressed.
- Verizon paid forfeiture, forfeiting jury trial; commenters see PR/legal calculus; some call for criminalization to deter intentional data misuse.

LLM perspective
- View: Second Circuit cements device-location as CPNI; compliance must include verified consent, not delegated contracts.
- Impact: Carriers face tighter audits of data-sharing programs; vendors like Securus become high-risk; cross-circuit split foreshadows forum shopping.
- Watch next: Whether Supreme Court reconciles 2nd vs 5th on FCC penalties; FCC rulemakings; state privacy laws expanding to precise location.
