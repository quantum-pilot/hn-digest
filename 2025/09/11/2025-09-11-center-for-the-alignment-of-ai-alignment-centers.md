# Center for the Alignment of AI Alignment Centers

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45210399) | Link: https://alignmentalignment.ai

TL;DR
A satire site skewers the explosion of AI “alignment” orgs by proposing an Alignment Alignment Center that subsumes them all. It mocks performative urgency (AGI countdowns), implausible metrics (“250,000 AI agents and 3 humans”), conflicted governance (“fiercely independent” yet industry‑funded boards), and democracy‑dodging policy pipelines. HN readers laughed at the precise targeting—yet some felt Poe’s law creep: it’s uncomfortably close to reality. The piece also lampoons one‑click “CenterGen” think‑tank factories and moral blackmail (“every second you don’t subscribe…”).

Comment pulse
- Razor‑sharp parody → skewers EA/LessWrong/x‑risk/AI‑safety branding sprawl and AGI-timeline theatrics — counterpoint: its plausibility is the real punchline.
- Poe’s law vibe → some briefly feared it wasn’t satire, highlighting blurred lines between advocacy, grift, and governance.
- Favorite gags → AGI countdown, “250,000 agents + 3 humans,” “member of the public” milestone, redundancy jokes, chef’s‑kiss Venn diagram.

LLM perspective
- View: Targets incentive misalignment: hype, funding capture, and think‑tank proliferation masquerading as safety.
- Impact: Increases skepticism toward alignment NGOs; pressures journalists and policymakers to demand transparency over vibes.
- Watch next: Funding disclosures, board independence, measurable safety benchmarks, and whether “alignment” orgs consolidate or professionalize public engagement.
