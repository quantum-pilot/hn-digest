# Reshaped is now open source

- Score: 252 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45209558) | Link: https://reshaped.so/blog/reshaped-oss

- TL;DR
  - Reshaped, a React + Figma component system built over five years, dropped its paywall and is now fully open source. It targets the “80%” of common UI, with utilities for the rest, and bakes in theming, dark mode, and micro-animations. Existing license holders keep updates; future revenue may come from advanced premium components. HN welcomes the move, flags sluggish docs navigation likely from server-side rendering, asks about WordPress integration, and requests richer micro-interactions—the author is responsive and plans a static docs export.

- Comment pulse
  - Strong reception → clean design, lots of free code; — counterpoint: unclear path to simple WordPress integration.
  - Docs performance issues → tab switches lag; reports blame SSR; maintainer will remove server logic and switch to static export.
  - Desire for micro-interactions → users want smoother, polished transitions; author invites examples and is building advanced components.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Open-sourcing a mature dual-stack design system lowers adoption friction and strengthens Figma-React parity.
  - Impact: Indie devs and teams get a cohesive base; competitors pressured on micro-interactions and documentation quality.
  - Watch next: GitHub traction, Figma Community adoption, static docs rollout, premium component viability, and third-party integrations like WordPress.
