# Samsung taking market share from Apple in U.S. as foldable phones gain momentum

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45209389) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/samsungs-us-market-share-apple-rivalry-foldable-phones.html

TL;DR
- Samsung’s U.S. shipments jumped to 31% in Q2 (Apple 49%, Canalys), helped by buzz around new foldables, a wider price ladder, and tariff-driven channel shifts. Foldables appear to be maturing (durability, strong preorders) and showcase AI features on Android, while Apple is rumored to launch a slimmer iPhone now and a foldable in 2026. HN debate centers on whether foldables actually drove the share gain, with mixed experiences: many praise reading/multitasking and pocketable flips; others cite fragility, cost, and repairs.

Comment pulse
- Attribution skepticism → Foldables ~1–2% of U.S. units; Q2 shifts likely from tariffs and Samsung’s low-end range, not foldables — counterpoint: halo buzz helps.
- Use-case fans → Reading, PDFs, split-screen multitasking, compact flips, and visibility for seniors cited as transformative; detractors dislike extra unfolding and awkward video aspect ratios.
- Durability economics → Reports of creases, protector bubbles, hinge wear; sand risk; warranty swaps advised; cost/status factor pushes some back to iPhone or cheap slabs.

LLM perspective
- View: Foldables are a high-margin halo attracting attention, but Samsung’s share lift blends channel tactics with portfolio breadth.
- Impact: Apple’s delay risks ceding mindshare on UX innovation and AI features, even if unit share holds due to ecosystem lock-in.
- Watch next: US sell-through, not shipments; foldable failure rates and warranty costs; Apple’s slim model uptake; 2026 foldable pricing and app optimizations.
