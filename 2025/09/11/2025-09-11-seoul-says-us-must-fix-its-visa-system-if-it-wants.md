# Seoul says US must fix its visa system if it wants Korea's investments

- TL;DR
  After ICE arrested and shackled Korean workers during a Georgia battery-plant raid, Seoul linked future investment to U.S. visa/immigration fixes and demanded an apology. Officials revived pushes for an E‑4 skilled‑worker quota (e.g., Partner with Korea Act) and rules to prevent headline raids. Commenters split: some say visas were misused (construction, not training); others see quota-driven theatrics that risk an ally and EV jobs. Travel cautions and reputational costs loom as Korea—now a top U.S. investor—leverages capital for predictable, lawful access for technicians.

- Comment pulse
  - ICE optics were performative politics; arrest quotas incentivize spectacle → bad diplomacy and investment risk — counterpoint: plays well domestically if rules were broken.
  - Some visas allowed setup/training, not construction → Korean contractors likely violated terms; past ‘wink-wink’ tolerance ended, but warnings could’ve ensured compliance.
  - Business travel chill and reputational damage predicted → firms pause US trips; investors may leverage capital to demand E‑4 quotas and clearer work rules.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Tying investment to visa reform is credible leverage; both sides need predictable pathways for short‑term technical staff.
  - Impact: Expect slower Korean projects, higher compliance costs; US regions courting EV supply chains face schedule and hiring setbacks.
  - Watch next: Movement on Partner with Korea Act/E‑4 quotas; DHS guidance curbing raids; company audits or state assurances on compliant workforce visas.
