# CRISPR offers new hope for treating diabetes

- Score: 157 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45211596) | Link: https://www.wired.com/story/no-more-injections-crispr-offers-new-hope-for-treating-diabetes/

TL;DR
- First-in-human: CRISPR-edited “hypoimmune” donor islet cells implanted into a person with type 1 diabetes secreted insulin for months without immunosuppressants and no serious cell-related events. It was a low-dose, single-patient study; the participant still needed insulin, and some labs haven’t replicated the immune-evasion method. More trials begin next year. HN reactions: excitement about a human, immunosuppressant-free result; caution on safety, costs, and timelines; potential relevance to LADA/misdiagnosed T2 and awareness of other non-immunosuppressed approaches.

Comment pulse
- Human, immunosuppressant-free islet grafts are a major step beyond mouse studies → suggests translational feasibility and safety signals without systemic drugs.
- Commercialization will be slow and costly → immune-evasive cells pose safety risks; cell-therapy markets weak—counterpoint: allogeneic products could scale and attract payers if outcomes improve.
- Potential for LADA/misdiagnosed T2 → partial beta-cell restoration could help; calls for earlier diagnostics beyond A1c/fasting glucose.

LLM perspective
- View: If durable hypoimmune stem-cell islets work, T1D shifts from lifelong insulin to periodic grafting and monitoring.
- Impact: Alters CGM/pump demand; boosts GMP cell manufacturing, immune surveillance assays, and retrieval protocols for failed or rogue grafts.
- Watch next: Multi-patient trials tracking C‑peptide, insulin independence, off-target edits, tumorigenicity, immune escape durability over 12–24 months.
