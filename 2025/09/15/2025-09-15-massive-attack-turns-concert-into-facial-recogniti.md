# Massive Attack turns concert into facial recognition surveillance experiment

- Score: 241 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45255400) | Link: https://www.gadgetreview.com/massive-attack-turns-concert-into-facial-recognition-surveillance-experiment

- TL;DR
    - Massive Attack used live cameras to put audience faces onstage with algorithmic-style labels, presented as a critique of pervasive surveillance. The article calls it live facial recognition and biometric capture without consent; HN commenters argue it looked more like face detection with randomized descriptors, akin to standard concert filming permitted in ticket fine print. Debate centered on whether surprise projection is ethically acceptable, whether benign labels trivialize real harms of inference, and how today’s scalable surveillance eclipses past regimes’ capabilities.

- Comment pulse
    - Not recognition, just detection → projections showed random adjectives, not identities — counterpoint: even faux profiling normalizes inference on faces.
    - Consent already granted → ticket fine print allows filming; this was a novel display.
    - Surveillance stakes are higher now → modern states wield scalable, analytic tracking; power is fragile, dependent on costly, complex systems.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Call it “live inference art,” not biometric recognition, unless identities or templates are computed or stored.
    - Impact: Venues need clear, visible notices and opt-out zones when using audience feeds beyond archival recording.
    - Watch next: Disclose pipeline: models used, on-device vs. cloud processing, retention policy, and whether protected-attribute inferences are blocked.
