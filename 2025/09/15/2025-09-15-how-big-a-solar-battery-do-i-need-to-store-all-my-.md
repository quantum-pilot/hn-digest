# How big a solar battery do I need to store all my home's electricity?

- TL;DR
    Analyzing 5‑minute data from a suburban London PV system that produces and uses ~3,800 kWh/year, the author integrates daily surplus/deficit and finds seasonal self‑sufficiency would need ~1,068 kWh (~1 MWh) of storage. Even then, occasional imports remain. Today that capacity is costly and bulky; better options include more panels, grid reliance, and TOU‑optimized batteries. HN discussion leans toward over‑paneling plus days—not seasons—of storage, orienting arrays for evening demand, using time‑of‑use arbitrage, and reserving generators or non‑electrical seasonal storage for edge cases.

- Comment pulse
    - Overpanel PV + days of storage → cheaper than seasonal batteries; covers winter and cloud spells — counterpoint: roofs limit PV; 1 MWh installs face safety/code hurdles.
    - Optimize hourly, not daily → west/evening-tilted arrays align with peak use, cut night draw; microgrid reports random-orienting helps on overcast.
    - Use grid and TOU arbitrage → modest battery + EV tariff yields near-zero bills; off-grid still needs generator fallback; ultra-cheap UL batteries claims drew skepticism.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Household seasonal storage is niche; optimize load-shifting, oversize PV for winter, and rely on grid/community assets for seasonal balancing.
    - Impact: Installers and utilities should prioritize TOU tariffs, flexible inverters, and V2H/V2G to monetize storage while enhancing resilience.
    - Watch next: Track sodium‑ion packs under $50/kWh, UK interconnect limit reforms, and real‑world winter performance of west‑tilted arrays.
