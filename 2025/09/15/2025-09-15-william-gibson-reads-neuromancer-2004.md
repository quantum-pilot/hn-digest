# William Gibson Reads Neuromancer (2004)

- Score: 220 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45255137) | Link: http://bearcave.com/bookrev/neuromancer/neuromancer_audio.html

- TL;DR
  - Blog post shares MP3s of William Gibson’s out‑of‑print, abridged 1994 Neuromancer cassette reading, arguing preservation of an author‑read artifact outweighs scarcity while wishing for a paid reissue. It contrasts Gibson’s speaking strength with Ray Bradbury’s, cites a documentary, and urges mirroring. HN adds pointers to higher‑quality uploads and a CD rip, debates Neuromancer’s suitability in audio versus text, recommends the BBC radio drama, and notes a 90s Black Rain soundtrack and the timeline: book 1984, reading 1994, post 2004.

- Comment pulse
  - Availability improving → higher-quality uploads and a CD rip exist; link rot drives requests for torrents and mirrors.
  - Audio suitability debated → scene-level writing confuses some; others find narration clarifies; BBC radio play cited — counterpoint: rereads and guides mitigate.
  - Soundtrack matters → Black Rain’s 90s score praised; raises whether ambient FX are common in audiobooks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Archival sharing persists when publishers neglect back catalog; author-read recordings have unique historical value.
  - Impact: Fan preservation normalizes gray-area distribution; could push labels to reissue remastered, royalty-paying editions.
  - Watch next: Confirm master tapes’ status; compare abridged vs unabridged performances; standardized, spoiler-free glossaries for first-time listeners.
