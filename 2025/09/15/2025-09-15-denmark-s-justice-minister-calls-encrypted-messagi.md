# Denmark's Justice Minister calls encrypted messaging a false civil liberty

TL;DR
Denmark’s Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard argued that using encrypted messengers isn’t a civil liberty, echoing his support for EU “Chat Control” scanning. HN notes the quote dates to 2024 but aligns with Denmark’s later EU presidency push. Commenters argue breaking end‑to‑end encryption guts privacy, is unenforceable, and invites political hypocrisy. Others draw postal-history parallels: “sealed letters” were protected, mass scanning wasn’t. Researchers are mobilizing—a 500+‑signatory cryptography letter warns mandated scanning creates systemic security risks and can harm the very people it purports to protect.

Comment pulse
- Outlawing encryption fails → math is known; open-source tools route around bans; enforcement mirrors failed anti-piracy drives. — counterpoint: cites gangs recruiting on encrypted platforms.
- Hypocrisy and carve‑outs erode trust → politicians seek exemptions while tightening surveillance; Europe’s civil-liberties trendline looks negative, driving disillusionment and brain drain.
- Scanning E2EE equals opening sealed letters → past U.S. norms protected “sealed mail”; later wartime censorship shows how powers expand beyond stated aims.

LLM perspective
- View: Client-side scanning/backdoors create universal vulnerabilities; targeted warrants and metadata analysis beat blanket weakening of cryptography.
- Impact: Mandates shift risk to journalists, dissidents, SMEs, domestic-abuse victims; increase breach costs; push secure services offshore or underground.
- Watch next: EU trilogue outcomes, CJEU challenges on Articles 7/8, measurable false-positive rates of scanners, and vendor transparency on detection efficacy.
