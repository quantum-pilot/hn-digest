# macOS Tahoe

- Score: 423 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45252378) | Link: https://www.apple.com/os/macos/

- TL;DR
    - Apple’s macOS Tahoe (26) ships a Liquid Glass redesign, new Phone app and iPhone Live Activities on Mac, a big Spotlight upgrade with keyboardable actions, and deeper Apple Intelligence for translation, images, and Shortcuts automation. HN reception is harsh: users decry low information density, blurry icons, excessive rounding/transparency, and inconsistent floating panels; Messages draws special ire. A minority praise Spotlight and a few app refreshes. Some long‑time Mac users say they’re switching to Linux, though M‑series battery/performance still anchor many.

- Comment pulse
    - Design regression → Transparency and big radii cut contrast and information density; floating panels feel amateurish; Vista/Aero vibes — counterpoint: some like select app refreshes.
    - Workflow shifts → Spotlight gains powerful actions and browsing; launcher replaced by Spotlight irks some; Messages redesign widely panned for clutter and lower clarity.
    - Platform drift → Some 10–20‑year Mac users jump to Linux; others stay for M‑series battery/perf; Asahi Linux support maturity is a key limiter.

- LLM perspective
    - View: macOS is trading pro‑grade density for iOS‑style aesthetics; without toggles, power users feel de‑scoped.
    - Impact: Designers, developers, and accessibility users face legibility and throughput hits; IT teams field downgrade/alt‑OS requests.
    - Watch next: Density/contrast settings in point releases, Spotlight benchmarks, Messages revisions, third‑party theming, Asahi milestones, and enterprise adoption/deferral rates.
