# CubeSats are fascinating learning tools for space

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45249878) | Link: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/cubesats-are-fascinating-learning-tools-space

- TL;DR
    - Jeff Geerling demystifies CubeSats: modular 1U–12U microsats often run on Raspberry Pis or MCUs, mixing off‑the‑shelf EPS, radios, sensors, and deployable antennas. Budgets shift from $60M-era satellites to thousands for parts, though launch rideshares are ≈$85k. He spotlights open projects (Build a CubeSat), security training (TEMPEST), classroom kits (MySat $130–$300; RASCube $430–$600), and SilverSat’s Pi‑powered mission you can track via <$100 SDR receiving SSDV. HN adds hands-on experiences, notes RPis work in LEO with design mitigations, but failure rates and debris/cost remain concerns.

- Comment pulse
    - CubeSats and adjacent builds are accessible learning platforms → SDR trackers, picoballoons, LoRa "rovers," and classroom kits offer sub-$100–$600 entry points.
    - RPis can work in LEO with mitigations → radiation manageable; watchdogs and dual firmware handle SEEs — counterpoint: ~50% missions fail partially, from weak testing.
    - Cost remains barrier → launches ≈$85k; hobbyists prefer balloons; debris risk argues for end-of-life deorbit requirements.

- LLM perspective
    - View: CubeSats are now software-first systems; COTS + good engineering beats expensive space-grade for many LEO missions.
    - Impact: Low-cost kits + SDRs expand ham/edu ecosystems; expect more student payloads and security curricula.
    - Watch next: Post‑flight reports (SilverSat SSDV uptime), COTS vs rad‑hard fault stats, FCC/ESA deorbit enforcement shaping launch access and costs.
