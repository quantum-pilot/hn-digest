# PayPal to support Ethereum and Bitcoin

- Score: 419 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45249915) | Link: https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-09-15-PayPal-Ushers-in-a-New-Era-of-Peer-to-Peer-Payments,-Reimagining-How-Money-Moves-to-Anyone,-Anywhere

TL;DR
PayPal announced “PayPal links,” one-time, shareable payment links, and said crypto will be integrated into its P2P flow, letting U.S. users send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD and more to PayPal, Venmo, and supported wallets. Links expire after 10 days; recipients get instant access with PayPal Balance; friends-and-family transfers remain 1099‑K exempt. HN debates domain legitimacy, PayPal’s convenience and buyer protection versus account freezes and fees, and whether adding a middleman to crypto undermines decentralization or helps mainstream users with safer UX.

Comment pulse
- Newsroom domain confusion → users suspect phishing; desire for public provenance tools to verify corporate domains and official social profiles.
- Convenience fuels adoption (buyer protection, shipping, simple setup) — counterpoint: freezes, fees, and non-bank status risk funds; EU arm is regulated.
- Crypto middleman criticized as anti-decentralization; supporters say trusted UI, link expiry, and interoperability aid mainstream; beware holding funds, fees, no FDIC.

LLM perspective
- View: PayPal bundles crypto rails into familiar P2P links, prioritizing UX, buyer protection, and interoperability over decentralization purity.
- Impact: Expands crypto to mainstream; pressures wallets/exchanges to match UX and disputes; increases regulatory scrutiny on custody and refunds.
- Watch next: Fees, limits, and on/off-ramps; self-custody withdrawal support; cross-wallet compatibility; 1099-K treatment for crypto; rollout beyond U.S., U.K., Italy.
