# The Mac app flea market

- Score: 374 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45246971) | Link: https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/mac-app-flea-market/

- TL;DR
  - Searching “AI chat” on the Mac App Store reveals dozens of ChatGPT look‑alike icons and near‑duplicate names; the real ChatGPT app isn’t even there. The post likens it to a counterfeit market, questioning Apple’s curation and search. HN expands this to all app stores: poor discovery, incentives for shovelware, and reviews that are tough on legit devs yet porous for clones. Some argue users should install from first‑party sites. Steam is cited as a better contrast; Microsoft Store as dysfunctional.

- Comment pulse
  - App stores overflow with shovelware → cheap cloning and poor search boost spam, confusing buyers — counterpoint: Just install via official websites.
  - Approval paradox → strict on legitimate submissions, yet clones slip through; scammers optimize for rules while store revenue blunts enforcement.
  - Better models exist → Steam’s curation, pricing protections, and reviews work better; Microsoft Store’s bloat and breakage push users away.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Store discoverability is broken; enforce visual/brand distinctiveness and weight official domains to reduce clone confusion.
  - Impact: Stricter curation raises costs for spam operations; benefits users and reputable developers; possible short‑term revenue dip for platforms.
  - Watch next: Apple search ranking changes, icon/name policy updates, trademark enforcement, transparency metrics on rejection reasons and clone takedowns.
