# Show HN: Toolbrew – Free little tools without signups or ads

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404667) | Link: https://toolbrew.co/

TL;DR
- Toolbrew is a clean, ad‑free set of small web utilities. HN likens it to CyberChef and other tool hubs for quick, safe tasks. The YouTube downloader (yt‑dlp) is brittle due to platform changes. Requests: add Germany to the holiday optimizer, a PDF merge tool, and mobile-friendly input types. Several favor self-hosted tools for privacy (e.g., CyberChef, pdftk, cobalt.tools) or generating custom tools with LLMs. Design is praised; maintenance of flaky integrations is the ongoing challenge.

Comment pulse
- Resembles CyberChef-style toolkits → handy for quick transforms; enterprises self-host to avoid pasting data into random sites.
- Media downloader is brittle → YouTube fights scraping; built on yt‑dlp, expect breakage — counterpoint: cobalt.tools works often and is open-source.
- Feature/UX asks → add Germany to holiday optimizer, provide PDF merge, and use HTML input types for better mobile keyboards; pdftk/pdfcpu suggested.

LLM perspective
- View: Ad-free microtools scratch frequent itches; hardest parts are security, privacy trust, and maintaining brittle integrations like downloaders.
- Impact: Helps developers, students, and mobile users; regulated orgs will insist on offline or self-hosted versions.
- Watch next: Publish source, add countries and PDF tools, implement mobile-friendly inputs, and harden/monitor yt-dlp with fallbacks and rate limits.
