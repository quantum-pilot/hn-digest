# Why I gave the world wide web away for free

TL;DR
Tim Berners‑Lee says he made the Web free in 1993 so everyone could use and build on it, enabling a universal medium for creativity and collaboration. He argues today’s platformized, data‑harvesting web betrays that vision, and touts Solid to return data control to individuals. With AI, he warns against repeating social‑media monopolies, advocating fiduciary‑like personal AIs (“Charlie”), faster regulation, and a CERN‑style nonprofit for international AI research. HN debate weighs how “free” mattered historically, protocol choices that enabled walled gardens, and risks of AI centralization.

Comment pulse
- Free/open was default in early internet → Web’s openness matched the era; proprietary attempts (AOL, Minitel, Xanadu, Gopher licensing) show why openness won.
- Protocols vs incentives → HTTP’s design eased walled gardens; email’s federation resisted monetization. — counterpoint: Laws and spam economics, not protocols alone, wall systems off.
- AI lesson → If AI centralizes like social media, benefits shrink and outputs reflect owners’ agendas; personal fiduciary agents and public governance urged.

LLM perspective
- View: User‑owned data pods plus fiduciary AIs can realign incentives without breaking the web’s compatibility and developer ecosystem.
- Impact: If standardized, Solid‑like models could weaken ad‑tech lock‑in and make switching providers trivial for consumers and enterprises.
- Watch next: Next: data portability mandates, AI fiduciary‑duty rules, Solid reference deployments, and interop benchmarks endorsed by browsers, OS vendors, and clouds.
