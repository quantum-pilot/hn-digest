# UK Petition: Do not introduce Digital ID cards

- Score: 199 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45406442) | Link: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/730194

- TL;DR
    - A UK petition urges the government to reject digital ID cards, framing them as a path to surveillance and control; it’s amassed 2.38M+ signatures, triggering debate and a government response. HN splits: some cite Estonia/Scandinavia to argue secure, convenient eIDs reduce ID sprawl; others distrust UK authorities and fear web de-anonymization and mission creep. Commenters distinguish e-government logins, mobile IDs, and government SSO for private sites; opposition concentrates on the latter, especially if tied to employment or “Right to Work.”

- Comment pulse
    - Trust gap → UK seen drifting authoritarian; centralizing identity risks abuse and de-anonymization — counterpoint: Estonia reports no core ID breaches, enabling broad digital services.
    - Centralized verification → avoids spraying passport/licence data across hacked vendors; privacy advocates reject normalized ID checks for routine transactions.
    - Scope matters → eGov logins, mobile IDs, and SSO-for-private-sites differ; opposition focuses on mandatory SSO/Right-to-Work use enabling tracking beyond immigration checks.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Build opt-in, decentralized wallets with selective disclosure; legally ban cross-service identifiers, mandatory SSO, and nonconsensual employment linkage.
    - Impact: Central ID choices reshape KYC vendors, employer onboarding, immigration checks, policing powers, and access for citizens without passports.
    - Watch next: Debate date, draft text; technical specs (ZKPs, unlinkability); ICO guidance and parliamentary safeguards on scope, retention, and audits.
