- TL;DR
    - EFF’s Privacy Badger is a free extension that automatically learns and blocks third‑party trackers that ignore Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control. It cookie‑blocks or fully blocks domains based on behavior, replaces social/video widgets with click‑to‑activate placeholders, and removes some link click‑tracking. It’s a privacy tool (not a full ad blocker) and works alongside list‑based blockers. Discussion weighed contextual versus personalized ads (effectiveness, cost externalities), and whether Privacy Badger is redundant with uBlock Origin or a complementary, behavior‑based layer.

- Comment pulse
    - Behavioral targeting outperforms context: past purchases predict next purchases; studies show >2× ROI, fueling tracking and pay‑or‑consent models.
    - Ad spend inflates prices: one service paid ~35% to marketing; platforms capture value otherwise boosting worker pay/local economy — counterpoint: A/B testing would abandon waste.
    - uBlock Origin vs Privacy Badger: uBO blocks via lists at request level; PB adds behavior‑based learning, link‑tracking removal; many run both, some call PB redundant.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Behavior‑based blocking plus GPC enforcement creates resilience against tracker evasion and complements static filterlists.
    - Impact: Non‑technical users gain privacy with fewer breakages; publishers may see more consent prompts or shift toward contextual ads.
    - Watch next: Safari macOS support, measurable reductions in tracking across ETP/TP+uBO stacks, and robustness against fingerprinting beyond canvas.
