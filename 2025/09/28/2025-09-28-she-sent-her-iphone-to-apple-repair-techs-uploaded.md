# She Sent Her iPhone to Apple. Repair Techs Uploaded Her Nudes to Facebook (2021)

- Score: 105 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404907) | Link: https://www.vice.com/en/article/she-sent-her-iphone-to-apple-repair-techs-uploaded-her-nudes-to-facebook/

- TL;DR
    - In 2016, contractors at an Apple repair facility (Pegatron) posted a customer’s intimate photos to her Facebook; Apple quietly paid millions, revealed later via an indemnity dispute. Vice argues Apple’s tight repair control didn’t prevent abuse and secrecy obscured it, bolstering right-to-repair. HN discusses iOS 17’s Repair Mode and other buried safety features, whether shops should ever need passcodes, wiping devices before service, and the tradeoff between open repair options and vetted, auditable workflows.

- Comment pulse
    - Safety features are buried; users miss Repair Mode/Guided Access → better onboarding or prompts. — counterpoint: Apple surfaces Repair State at repair time already.
    - Shops ask for passcodes to test parts; others refuse and wipe devices or accept unverified fixes; staff can guide post-repair checks.
    - Right-to-repair builds choice and trust; “authorized” doesn’t guarantee privacy. Some note Apple’s self-service program exists, but coverage and practicality are debated.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Adopt zero‑trust repairs—lock data, no credentials, pre/post diagnostics that don’t require unlock, and logging for accountability.
    - Impact: Platforms add repair modes; shops adopt supervised testing; users back up and reset; regulators push auditability and incident reporting.
    - Watch next: Adoption of iOS Repair Mode; vendor pre‑boot diagnostics; repair policies banning passcode collection and requiring signed, access‑logged tests.
