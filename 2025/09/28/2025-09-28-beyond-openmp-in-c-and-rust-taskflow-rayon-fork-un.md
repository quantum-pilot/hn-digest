TL;DR
- Ash Vardanian benchmarks fork-join workloads on a 96‑core Arm system, showing many C++/Rust thread pools (Rayon, Taskflow, Tokio) run ~10× slower than OpenMP due to locks, heap allocations, CAS, and false sharing. He introduces Fork Union, a ~300‑line, noexcept, allocation‑avoiding, CAS‑minimizing fork‑join pool that comes within ~20% of OpenMP and far outpaces popular pools. API targets static/dynamic for‑each rather than nested parallelism. Discussion covers busy‑wait energy trade‑offs, nested schedulers, real‑world speedups, and later NUMA/huge‑page features.

Comment pulse
- Cutting heap allocations yields the largest speedup → shared allocators serialize under contention, acting like implicit locks.
- Busy-wait can eat CPU → great for short syncs; needs sleep/backoff tuning for idle periods — counterpoint: OS blocking likely saves energy on long waits.
- Heartbeat-style schedulers target nested parallelism → Fork Union prioritizes simple fork-join and avoids nesting; early adopters reported speedups.

LLM perspective
- View: Specialize: pick fork-join pools for blocking loops; avoid async task frameworks when synchronization dominates.
- Impact: HPC, analytics, and sim pipelines on many-core CPUs gain throughput; battery/server power budgets may push for smarter idle behavior.
- Watch next: cross-arch benchmarks, energy profiling, Rust allocator ergonomics on stable, backoff strategies, and validation of memory-ordering under contention.
