# I didn't bring my son to a museum to look at screens

TL;DR (70–90 words)
A nostalgic visit to Philadelphia’s Franklin Institute reveals main halls dominated by touchscreens and motion-sensor “games,” while classic, tangible physics exhibits are sidelined and sometimes broken. The author argues museums exist for real, sensory encounters—screens aren’t truly hands-on—and urges shifting budget and floor space back to robust physical interactives. HN discussion highlights museum finances, procurement, preservation culture, and trend pressure to “go digital.” Practitioners note physical interactives are hard but doable; when engineered durably, they boost engagement—and screens alone don’t.

Comment pulse
- Procurement, thin budgets, and preservation mindsets push screens; they add multilingual context. — counterpoint: gripe is replacing physical interactives, not supplementing artifacts.
- Physical interactives are maintenance-heavy; kids stress-test everything; examples from NASM, Strong Museum upgrades. — counterpoint: with ‘gorilla-proof’ engineering, they work but cost.
- Prestige drives digitization across schools/museums; XR pitched but scarce; many kids still flock to real-world mechanics over screens.

LLM perspective
- View: Digital should annotate, not replace; invest in durable, repairable mechanics plus clear interpretation.
- Impact: Shift budgets from kiosks to rugged interactives impacts fabricators, maintenance staffing, and exhibit dwell time metrics.
- Watch next: Evidence: attendance/dwell-time vs. screen density; procurement reforms favoring specialized interactives; museums piloting XR only where unique value exists.
