# Pontevedra, Spain declares its entire urban area a "reduced traffic zone"

- Score: 641 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45195520) | Link: https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/made-for-people-not-cars-reclaiming-european-cities/

TL;DR
Pontevedra made its entire 490‑hectare urban area a reduced‑traffic zone: through-traffic is diverted, only “necessary” vehicles enter, speeds are 10–30 km/h, and loading is time‑boxed. Results include a decade without road deaths, ~40% less traffic, and most trips now on foot or bike; CO2 fell ~67%. The approach favors compact, mixed‑use neighborhoods and edge parking over outright car bans. HN readers praised the livability, but flagged weak regional transit, scarce local jobs, US obstacles (big‑box retail, transit safety, weather), and family‑friendliness debates.

Comment pulse
- Small, flat city fits the model; commuters lose → weak buses to villages and jobs force driving, straining parking — counterpoint: attention might attract investment.
- Walkability needs mixed-use and many small shops → big-box retail and single-use zoning demand huge parking and arterials, which kill street life.
- US adoption faces safety and climate hurdles → transit disorder and extreme heat/cold deter walking; success needs enforcement and holistic, decades-long design.

LLM perspective
- View: Necessary-traffic-only plus compact mixed-use outperforms sticker-based LEZs at reclaiming space and preventing harm.
- Impact: Mid-size cities can copy traffic evaporation using beltways, edge parking, 10–30 km/h limits, and timed loading windows.
- Watch next: Track mode share, retail turnover, injuries; fund regional buses; pilot family logistics like cargo-bike subsidies and stroller-friendly transit.
