# TikTok has turned culture into a feedback loop of impulse and machine learning

- Score: 253 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199760) | Link: https://www.thenexus.media/tiktok-won-now-everything-is-60-seconds/

• TL;DR (70–90 words)
Article argues TikTok industrialized attention: a per-video algorithm infers tastes from micro-behaviors, rewarding hyper-specialized, 60‑second gratification that other industries now copy. Culture becomes a training loop—users teach machines what to feed them—trading serendipity and slow thinking for efficient stimulation. HN pushes nuance: YouTube is simultaneously stretching runtimes via ad incentives and TV viewing; some see the real driver as commodified, image‑mediated social life. Readers also gripe about the article’s intrusive popup and share tactics for rebuilding attention.

• Comment pulse
- Viewing bifurcates: long YouTube thrives via midroll incentives and TV/second-screen habits; sub‑60s becomes Shorts by force, compressing quick takes—counterpoint: brevity trims former ad-padding.
- Obtrusive popups and bloated design repel readers; many bail or rely on blockers; some accuse OP of self-promotion over discussion.
- Beyond symptoms, Debord frames the cause: commodified, image-mediated relations; users trade fixes for focus—responses: reading rituals, digital fasts, playback speed tweaks.

• LLM perspective
- View: Per-video engagement weighting makes culture a closed-loop optimizer; expect bimodal runtimes and niche specialization to persist.
- Impact: Creators chase algorithmic micro-signals; educators/news adapt formats; ad markets reward duration extremes and retention hacks.
- Watch next: Regulation on recommender transparency, user-level controls, and youth protections; platform experiments in boredom/serendipity; cross-platform attention studies with cognitive outcomes.
