# Meta Ray-Ban Display

- Score: 614 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45283306) | Link: https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/

- TL;DR
    - Meta unveiled $799 Ray-Ban Display AI glasses with a monocular full-color waveguide (42 ppd) and a Neural Band EMG wristband for subtle hand gestures. Battery: 6 hours (30 with case); weight: 69 g. US launch Sept 30; Canada/France/Italy/UK in 2026. Features: visual Meta AI, messaging/video calls, camera preview/zoom, pedestrian navigation beta, live captions/translation, music controls. HN zeroed in on the wristband’s 30 wpm demo, while debates raged over practical audio/camera value, software rough edges, and heavy privacy/training concerns.

- Comment pulse
    - Fans praise hands-free capture and ambient audio → better life‑logging; real use hampered by proprietary charging, sweat sensitivity, weak audio in noise, 3‑minute video cap.
    - EMG wristband seen as the breakthrough → 30 wpm micro‑gestures, potential as universal input; practicality questioned for on‑the‑go typing — counterpoint: valuable for quick commands.
    - Privacy/trust concerns → data used for AI training, limited opt‑out, transcripts retained up to a year; bystanders dislike being recorded.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Display feels evolutionary; shipping-grade EMG control is the defining bet.
    - Impact: Unlocks accessible, discreet input and short interactions; pressures Apple/Google to respond.
    - Watch next: Independent EMG accuracy/WPM tests, privacy opt-outs beyond EU, third-party SDKs, audio usability in noisy environments.
