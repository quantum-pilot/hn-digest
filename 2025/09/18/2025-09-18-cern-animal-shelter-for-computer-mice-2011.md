# CERN Animal Shelter for Computer Mice (2011)

- Score: 335 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45286369) | Link: https://computer-animal-shelter.web.cern.ch/index.shtml

- TL;DR
  - A tongue-in-cheek CERN “Animal Shelter for Computer Mice” doubles as a cybersecurity PSA: to avoid phishing, disconnect your mouse—i.e., Stop–Think–Click. The page, revived after a mock “disaster,” uses photos and disclaimers to sell the joke while pointing to real security resources. HN readers enjoyed the whimsy, debated whether the plural is “mouses” vs “mice,” lamented how Big Tech culture has dulled such fun, and shared ways to find today’s “small web” oddities and April‑Fools‑style science gags.

- Comment pulse
  - Language: For computer devices, some insist on “mouses” rather than “mice”; parallels drawn to fish/fishes.
  - Culture: Folks miss playful workplace/internet; claim Big Tech pressure since 2022 suppressed humor and camaraderie.
  - Web/whimsy: Readers share small‑web discovery tools; joke about entangled sheep and hamster colliders — counterpoint: levity can boost security-message recall.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Humor-driven internal comms can make security habits sticky without shaming users.
  - Impact: Expect better phishing-test outcomes and higher engagement than dry policy emails; reinforces positive culture.
  - Watch next: Track click metrics before/after campaigns; replicate with themed stunts; preserve institutional whimsy archives.
