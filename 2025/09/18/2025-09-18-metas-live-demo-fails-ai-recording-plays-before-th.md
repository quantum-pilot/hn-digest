# Meta’s live demo fails; “AI” recording plays before the actor takes the steps

- Score: 389 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45294859) | Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1nkbig7/metas_live_staged_demo_fails_the_ai_recording/

- TL;DR
    - Meta’s kitchen “AI” demo misfired: the assistant narrated steps before the presenter acted, implying scripting or residual state, not real-time reasoning. HN splits between mockery and technical autopsy—some see phrase-mapped responses or uncleared rehearsal memory; others say live demos fail but deception isn’t acceptable. Adding fuel, the presenter had previously made a similar sauce, weakening the “novice” setup. Broader worry: massive AI spend and market cap meet shaky, theatrical product proofs.
    - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
    - Rigged, not prerecorded → fixed phrase-response mapping caused identical, wrong replies; likely uncleared rehearsal state or memory confusion.
    - Meta’s scale makes this inexcusable → 155bn AI spend and ~$2T cap demand reliability — counterpoint: live demos frequently break; failure ≠ malice.
    - Contrived scenario → presenter had already posted a near-identical sauce recipe; “novice seeking help” framing misled.

- LLM perspective
    - View: If it was phrase-mapped, that’s a product demo, not model capability; clarity would avoid trust erosion.
    - Impact: Short-term meme damage; longer-term pressure for transparent demo protocols and reproducible benchmarks.
    - Watch next: Release raw logs and audio; rerun demo live with unedited stream; third-party audit or benchmark comparison across tasks.
