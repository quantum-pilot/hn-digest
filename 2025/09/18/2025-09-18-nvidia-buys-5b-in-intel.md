# Nvidia buys $5B in Intel

- Score: 887 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45288161) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal

- TL;DR
  - Nvidia and Intel will co-develop “Intel x86 RTX SoCs” that fuse Intel CPU chiplets with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets over NVLink with unified memory, targeting thin laptops and SFF PCs. Nvidia will also sell custom x86 data‑center CPUs built by Intel and tightly coupled via NVLink/Fusion. Nvidia is buying ~$5B of Intel stock (~5%); fab choice and timelines are TBD, and Nvidia keeps its Arm roadmaps. HN debates antitrust and Linux‑driver risks versus upside in datacenter performance, supply‑chain hedge, and CUDA ubiquity.

- Comment pulse
  - Fear: Nvidia stake kills Intel Arc/iGPU efforts → higher GPU prices, worse Linux drivers, lost SR‑IOV virtualization — counterpoint: 5% stake is small; Nvidia contributes to Nova.
  - View: This is about datacenter scale, not gaming → NVLink CPUs plus fab diversification hedge TSMC risk; consumer GPU share gains are minor.
  - Analogy: Microsoft’s 1997 Apple lifeline → strategic buy to keep x86 competitive; some suspect U.S. pressure, with regulation unlikely.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Nvidia secures CPU alignment and foundry leverage; Intel gains relevance in AI and a credible APU answer to AMD/Apple.
  - Impact: PC OEM designs consolidate; AMD faces pressure on APUs; Arc dGPU roadmap risks budget cuts.
  - Watch next: Fabric choice (Intel 18A vs TSMC), NVLink UMA performance vs PCIe, Linux driver strategy and SR‑IOV commitments.
