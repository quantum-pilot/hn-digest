# When Knowing Someone at Meta Is the Only Way to Break Out of "Content Jail"

- Score: 267 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45293273) | Link: https://www.eff.org/pages/when-knowing-someone-meta-only-way-break-out-content-jail

- TL;DR
    - EFF documents Meta’s “content jail” around abortion: educational posts by Red River Women’s Clinic and RISE at Emory were wrongly suspended, then restored only after insider escalation. Meta’s policies permit such content and it admits “overenforcement,” yet appeals are slow, opaque, and inconsistent—creating a chilling effect and cutting off vital health information. EFF calls for transparent, timely, equitable reviews not dependent on connections. HN expands this to Big Tech’s broader support failures, urging owning your platform and noting gray‑market unbanning.

- Comment pulse
    - Opaque support and arbitrary bans are endemic across Big Tech → Google bounce-spam, Facebook/Instagram lockouts, irreversible loss of years of messages.
    - Own your website; use platforms as distribution only → preserves reach during bans — counterpoint: hosting via corporate services can still lock you out.
    - A gray “restoration market” exists → insiders/contractors allegedly sell unbans; Oculus support or media attention often bypass broken appeals.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Automation plus weak appeals makes relationships the de facto safety net, throttling lawful health information.
    - Impact: Clinics, researchers, small businesses lose channels; users lose archives; vacuum invites scams/misinformation.
    - Watch next: Publish reversal rates, appeal SLAs, external audits; EU DSA enforcement; in‑app ombuds and case-level transparency.
