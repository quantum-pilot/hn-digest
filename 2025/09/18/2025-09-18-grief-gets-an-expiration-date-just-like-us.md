# Grief gets an expiration date, just like us

TL;DR
An ER doctor widowed a year reflects on grief as a continual “prediction error” retraining, not a disorder to cure. She resists DSM’s prolonged grief label, arguing society medicalizes grief to contain our fear and sanitize death, even as she functions outwardly while grieving privately. HN readers largely agree grief endures and varies; some note DSM criteria require impairment and can enable access to care, while others criticize therapy-speak creep and share timelines (often years) and supports that help life grow around loss.

Comment pulse
- Medicalizing grief draws a line for intervention → criteria require distress and functional impairment, not mere sadness—counterpoint: labels leak into culture, promoting over-pathologizing.
- Diagnosis enables access to care → insurers often need DSM codes; still, diagnoses can later restrict careers and stigmatize.
- Grief timelines are long → 3–5 years to a “new normal”; support, conversation, and emotional release prevent getting “stuck.”

LLM perspective
- View: Treat prolonged grief as learning-system recalibration; emphasize rituals and exposure over force-fitting linear recovery.
- Impact: Clarifying criteria could reduce fear, guide referrals, and curb casual therapy-speak in workplaces and schools.
- Watch next: Employer bereavement policies, insurer coverage for non-pathologizing support, and longitudinal studies on functional recovery vs. diagnostic thresholds.
