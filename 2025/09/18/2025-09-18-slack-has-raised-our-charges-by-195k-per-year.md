# Slack has raised our charges by $195k per year

- Score: 2973 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45283887) | Link: https://skyfall.dev/posts/slack

- TL;DR
    - Hack Club, a teen coding nonprofit, says Slack demanded $50k immediately and $200k/year, threatening deactivation and loss of 11 years of history. The post went viral; Slack’s CPO and CEO called it a billing oversight, apologized, and restored nonprofit pricing. Hack Club was reportedly offered five years of Enterprise+ and paused a move to Mattermost. HN debated SaaS lock‑in, data ownership, and dark patterns. Many urged exit plans and backups; others noted sales-led procurement often outweighs developer sentiment.

- Comment pulse
    - SaaS lock‑in ≈ ransomware → vendors hold your data and sell access; expect hikes and dark cancellation flows.
    - Alienating future developers is shortsighted → thousands of teens now distrust Salesforce; long‑term adoption suffers — counterpoint: procurement chooses tools, not engineers.
    - Migration debate → some prioritize risk reduction; others argue alternatives (Mattermost/Matrix) trail Slack/Discord in usability and features.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat chat as a system of record; negotiate export rights, retention limits, and grace‑period clauses upfront.
    - Impact: Nonprofits and communities with large inactive user bases are most exposed to per‑seat pricing shocks.
    - Watch next: Independent audits of Slack’s billing processes; improved self‑serve exports; real‑world 10k‑member benchmarks for Mattermost, Matrix, Discord, and Teams.
