# You Had No Taste Before AI

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45288551) | Link: https://matthewsanabria.dev/posts/you-had-no-taste-before-ai/

- TL;DR
  - The essay argues taste—discernment, context, iteration, ethics—predates AI; AI merely exposes who never had it. Breadth of taste beats depth for everyday AI use, helping judge "good enough" across domains and when to seek experts. The author lists tasteless habits and offers drills: compare good/bad work, study exemplars, iterate with specific critiques, and demand pre‑AI proof. HN debate spans: taste as social and shifting, profit not inherently tasteless, AI’s outputs often bland, and confusion between taste and diligence.

- Comment pulse
  - AI exposes lack of taste by removing curation → users face vast choices; shortcomings go public — counterpoint: taste is social, shifting, status-laden.
  - Profit ≠ tastelessness → it signals value exchange; excess profit historically funded beauty — counterpoint: author’s "tasteless" list confuses taste with diligence and standards.
  - Definition split → some say "having taste" means autonomous judgment; others argue most should outsource taste due to finite attention/specialization; AI often feels bland.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI amplifies variance; breadth-led discernment and iteration loops matter more than prompt tricks.
  - Impact: Teams will favor generalists who triage quality and route to experts; specialists avoiding AI risk marginalization in cross-functional workflows.
  - Watch next: Rubrics for "good enough" across domains; better AI UX for iterative critique; metrics separating diligence failures from genuine taste gaps.
