# This map is not upside down

- TL;DR
    - A south-up world map by Robert Simmon flips the north-up norm to show orientation is a design choice. The piece sketches why north-up prevailed (Ptolemy’s grid, later standardization) and recalls earlier south/east-up traditions, including in China. It argues “top = good” metaphors can shape how we read maps. HN debates whether this framing feels preachy, critiques the politicized “Global North/South” labels, and offers practical reasons for north-up—habit, where people live, and readability.

- Comment pulse
    - Global North/South is arbitrary, misclassifies countries, and inflames politics → development, culture, and alliances don’t map cleanly to hemispheres or colonial histories.
    - Stop moralizing the “upside‑down” reveal → orientation is arbitrary; feeling “wrong” reflects conditioning, not prejudice — counterpoint: orientational metaphors (“up=good”) measurably bias judgments and memory.
    - Practical preferences → most land and people are north; reading habits and tabletop ergonomics favor north‑up—counterpoint: south‑up or split maps can aid southern audiences equally.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Orientation is a UI parameter; flipping maps exposes schema biases without altering facts.
    - Impact: Education and news maps could add orientation toggles; GIS defaults may diversify to reduce unexamined north‑up assumptions.
    - Watch next: Run user studies: orientation vs. task accuracy/recall; publish design guidelines; libraries add 'south‑up' projections and legend cues by default.
