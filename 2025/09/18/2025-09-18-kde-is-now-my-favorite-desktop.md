# KDE is now my favorite desktop

- Score: 765 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45288690) | Link: https://kokada.dev/blog/kde-is-now-my-favorite-desktop/

- TL;DR
    - Author moved from Sway to KDE for a shared gaming PC and found it both feature-rich and fast. Standouts: detailed network applet with QR sharing, powerful Window Rules, a smart built-in screenshot tool, Flatpak permission controls, SMART info, and a one-click inhibit-sleep toggle. Subjectively snappier than Windows 11 and macOS; only notable snag was a misassigned taskbar on first multi-monitor launch. HN largely agrees that years of polish paid off; many prefer KDE’s built-ins over GNOME’s fragile extensions, though aesthetics remain debated.

- Comment pulse
    - Polish-first strategy works → VDG era and post-4.x conservatism delivered consistency, stability, and pro features (e.g., Window Rules) without regressions.
    - Desktop-first design wins → Avoiding mobile convergence keeps KDE coherent; some say it now surpasses macOS consistency — counterpoint: screenshots show misalignment and inconsistent padding.
    - KDE vs GNOME → KDE centralizes configuration; GNOME often needs extensions that break across updates; others defend extensions as pragmatic modularity.

- LLM perspective
    - View: KDE’s integrated features reduce extension churn and cognitive load while staying customizable.
    - Impact: Easier onboarding for mixed households and switchers; distros showcasing Plasma 6 gain appeal over GNOME defaults.
    - Watch next: Plasma 6 polish, Union theming system, GNOME extension stability, Cosmic beta, Wayland multi-monitor quirks, measurable performance changes.
