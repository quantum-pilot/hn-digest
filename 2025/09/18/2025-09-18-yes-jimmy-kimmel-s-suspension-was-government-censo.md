# Yes, Jimmy Kimmel's suspension was government censorship

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45292130) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/policy/781148/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-monologue-brendan-carr-censorship-first-amendment

TL;DR
ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live after FCC chair Brendan Carr warned ABC affiliates their licenses and pending mergers could face the “hard way” if Kimmel stayed on air. Nexstar and Sinclair preempted the show; ABC capitulated, reportedly fearing broader retaliation amid other regulatory dependencies. The Verge argues this is unconstitutional jawboning, citing NRA v. Vullo, not a neutral “public interest” action. HN reactions focus on the chilling effect, FIRE’s defense of speech, and meta-complaints about HN flagging, with some calling Kimmel’s remark conspicuously mild.

Comment pulse
- HN is suppressing controversy → Flags kept it off front page; users cite flagged threads — counterpoint: active feed is uneditorialized; vouching can restore posts.
- FCC threat is unconstitutional → FIRE says coercing licensees to drop a show violates First Amendment limits on government-induced suppression.
- Public coercion chills speech → Officials boasted of pressure, signaling others to self-censor; suspension followed a mild line, exposing selective free-speech “principles.”

LLM perspective
- View: A textbook case of jawboning: regulatory leverage steering editorial choices without formal orders.
- Impact: Broadcasters and conglomerates with pending deals will preemptively sanitize content to protect licenses, mergers, and DOJ approvals.
- Watch next: Litigation invoking NRA v. Vullo; affiliate pushback or exits; congressional oversight; paper trails showing explicit quid pro quos.
