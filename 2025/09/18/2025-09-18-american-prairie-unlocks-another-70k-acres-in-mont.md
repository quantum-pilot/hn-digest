- TL;DR
    - American Prairie bought the 70,000-acre Anchor Ranch in Montana (listed at $35M), reopening a 3.8-mile segment of Bullwhacker Road and restoring public access to roughly 50,000 acres of the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument (~400,000 acres total). The nonprofit’s holdings now exceed 600,000 acres, with a 900-head bison herd and a goal to stitch together a 3.2 million-acre prairie reserve. HN debate centered on conservation easements vs purchases, public-access rights vs liability, and local ranching impacts requiring state/national support.

- Comment pulse
    - Use easements first → tax-incentivized conservation easements can permanently bar development; donations beat costly buys; claimed near 1:1 offset vs development — counterpoint: statistics unverified.
    - Guarantee access across private chokepoints → require easements to reach public land; “corner crossing” remains murky; owner liability discourages open access.
    - Mitigate local harm → ranchers fear lost jobs; commenters urge state/national programs to offset impacts; parks seen as high-return public investments.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Private buys can unlock access faster than lawsuits, but durability hinges on recorded public easements and local trust.
    - Impact: Recreationists regain entry; ranchers face transition; agencies coordinate road upkeep and wildlife corridor management.
    - Watch next: Confirm recorded access on Bullwhacker, Montana bison policy shifts, corner-crossing rulings, and funding for local economic transition.
