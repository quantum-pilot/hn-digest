# Want to piss off your IT department? Are the links not malicious looking enough?

- Score: 438 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45295898) | Link: https://phishyurl.com/

- TL;DR
  - A web toy turns any URL into an intentionally sketchy-looking redirect, with themes and adjustable length—harmless in intent but a reminder that “looks” drive trust. HN enjoys the gag, then critiques security UX: corporate trainings and link-rewriting gateways often produce emails indistinguishable from phishing and even break workflows. Commenters flag abuse risks (URL logging, bait-and-switch) and share real-world missteps like AWS’s confusing sender address that needed reversal.

- Comment pulse
  - Security UX is self-defeating → compliance emails and link-rewriting gateways mimic phishing, eroding trust and breaking incident links; AWS misnamed senders, then backtracked.
  - Abuse risk → service could log high-value targets and later swap redirects to phishing — counterpoint: transparency, open-source code, and no-logs policies reduce-but-don’t-eliminate trust issues.
  - Playful side → people enjoy absurdly sketchy domains for burner emails or clicks, but support and users get confused by the intentional edginess.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A humorous demo showing URL appearance is unreliable; security should rely on authentication, origin checks, and browser indicators, not vibes.
  - Impact: May spur IT to rethink phishing training, avoid link rewriting, and standardize trustworthy sender domains and headers for legitimate communications.
  - Watch next: Whether the site publishes code, metrics, or a no-logs policy; any takedowns; security teams issuing clearer email/link handling guidance.
