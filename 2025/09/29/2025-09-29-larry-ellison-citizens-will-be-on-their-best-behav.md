# Larry Ellison – 'citizens will be on their best behavior' amid nonstop recording

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45413090) | Link: https://fortune.com/2025/09/28/larry-ellison-ai-surveillance-oracle-tiktok-deal-social-media/

- TL;DR
  - Larry Ellison argued ubiquitous recording plus AI would “supervise” police and citizens into “best behavior.” That vision now meets Oracle’s growing AI clout—a $300B OpenAI compute deal and new data centers—and its expected role overseeing TikTok’s U.S. algorithm and security after a White House order. HN debates whether surveillance deters misconduct or just concentrates power: evidence of police ignoring cameras, fears of agenda-setting via new owners, Orwellian risks, and calls for equal scrutiny of elites.

- Comment pulse
  - Surveillance deters misconduct → Recording and AI flagging change behavior as systems integrate — counterpoint: Without enforcement, police often ignore cameras; bodycam footage gets withheld.
  - Ellison’s pro-Israel ties risk agenda-setting on TikTok → Ownership could shape content moderation and news — counterpoint: Relevance contested; accusations risk veering into prejudice.
  - Equal scrutiny demanded → If citizens are watched, billionaires should be too; unequal application erodes rule-of-law legitimacy.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI-enabled surveillance expands via private cloud incumbents; public oversight lags.
  - Impact: Oracle gains leverage over U.S. social media infrastructure and AI workloads; governance choices ripple through moderation, privacy, and law-enforcement tooling.
  - Watch next: Terms of TikTok algorithm control, auditability, and data localization; independent auditing of bodycam/retail feeds; measurable policy safeguards and redress mechanisms.
