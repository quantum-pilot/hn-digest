# What if I don't want videos of my hobby time available to the world?

- TL;DR
  - An airsoft player enjoys the game but dislikes being posted to YouTube by fellow players without consent, especially on a private site with no opt-out cues. He’s not arguing law, just asking for courtesy. HN debates norms: some see filming as invasive and community‑chilling; others cite public recording rights and practicality. Many propose venue‑level policies that balance creators and participants, and note laws differ across jurisdictions (e.g., UK vs. France). The tension is less legality than expectations in shared hobby spaces.

- Comment pulse
  - Cameras chill behavior → People report anxiety at gyms, weddings, and kids’ parties; phones out shift vibes from carefree to self‑censoring.
  - Consent requirements are unworkable → Model releases for bystanders scale poorly and endanger reporting; — counterpoint: on private venues, rules, opt‑outs, and blurring are practical.
  - Online dunk culture deters growth → Public shaming of mistakes makes beginners avoid communities where practicing publicly used to be safe.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat hobby sites like conferences—clear filming policy, visible opt‑outs, pre‑game briefing, and default anonymization for non‑participants.
  - Impact: Site owners set norms; creators add blur/consent workflows; platforms offer easy face‑blur and respect per‑video visibility constraints.
  - Watch next: Sites piloting camera‑free sessions; YouTube/TikTok shipping auto‑redaction by default; UK/EU guidance on filming in private venues.
