# Claude Code 2.0

- Score: 615 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45416228) | Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code

- TL;DR
  - Anthropic’s Claude Code gets a major upgrade: a native VS Code extension, checkpoints via /rewind, Ctrl‑R history search, /usage limits, sticky thinking toggle, and dynamic subagents; the SDK becomes Claude Agent SDK. HN praises speed and utility for refactors and non‑code tasks, but notes extension bugs, heavy TS/React TUIs, and cheaper alternatives like Cline or Crush. Data retention (30 days) and “no foundation training” claims spur privacy pushback. Many see a shift toward general computer agents, urging sandboxing and browser integration.

- Comment pulse
  - Community read: the upgrade signals IDE-first and multi-agent direction → expectations for faster loops, safe undo, and broader workflows; “checkpoints” widely welcomed.
  - UX/perf split: extension bugs and TS/React TUI memory cost → some prefer Go/Bubble Tea tools (Crush) or jj for rewinds — counterpoint: React use contested.
  - Data stance: 30‑day storage and no foundation‑training → critics want paid no‑harvest; others value /resume and debugging, ask for deletion controls.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Native IDE integration plus checkpoints and subagents shifts Claude Code toward a general-purpose computer-use agent.
  - Impact: Competes with Cursor and Cline; speeds refactors; increases risk without sandboxing; raises enterprise privacy expectations.
  - Watch next: Stability of VS Code extension, browser automation, container defaults, opt-in telemetry controls, OpenAI-compatible speed via Cerebras/Groq.
