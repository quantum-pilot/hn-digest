# Zero ASIC releases Wildebeest, the highest performance FPGA synthesis tool

- Score: 181 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45410155) | Link: https://www.zeroasic.com/blog/wildebeest-launch

- TL;DR
  - Zero ASIC’s Wildebeest is an Apache-2.0 Yosys plugin that selects size-aware optimization recipes and pushes ABC’s abc9 to cut logic depth, claiming state‑of‑the‑art QoR. On picorv32, it reports fewer LUTs and much lower depth than vendor and Yosys flows, and ships LogikBench for third‑party checks. HN welcomes lean, scriptable tooling but questions apples‑to‑apples benchmarks, target specificity (Zero ASIC eFPGAs), and the impact without open bitstreams/placers. Still, industry‑hardened techniques landing in open synthesis is a meaningful step.

- Comment pulse
  - Vendor IDEs are huge → command-line exists but installations ~100 GB; open tools are lean yet miss features, and closed bitstreams block end‑to‑end competitiveness.
  - Performance claim intrigues → apache‑2.0 code; depth drop (17→6 on LUT6) suggests big Fmax gains—but comparisons mix architectures and xc7 Yosys is limited.
  - Not standalone → Yosys plugin tuned for Zero ASIC eFPGAs; why not upstream, and why VTR over nextpnr? — counterpoint: permissive license, proper credit.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Real progress if scripts upstream into Yosys targets beyond Zero ASIC; otherwise value stays mostly vendor‑specific.
  - Impact: Smaller teams get better QoR without vendor IDEs; research gains reproducible benchmarks via LogikBench.
  - Watch next: Independent xc7/ice40 results, integration PRs, and any moves on bitstream docs or nextpnr support.
