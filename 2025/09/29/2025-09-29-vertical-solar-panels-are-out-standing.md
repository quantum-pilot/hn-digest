- TL;DR
  - Everyday Dave’s yearlong test in cloudy, snowy Ohio found vertically mounted north–south bifacial panels deliver far better winter output and earlier/later daily production, shed snow, and run cooler. Summer peaks and total energy favored tilted arrays: vertical produced 77% of tilted bifacial output over six months (tilted mono ~90%). Orientation choice depends on load and latitude: A/C-heavy homes prefer tilt; steady loads or TOU pricing may value shoulder-hour generation. Discussion weighed wind/anchoring challenges, fence/balcony uses, and east–west bifacial arrays for “anti–duck-curve” profiles.

- Comment pulse
  - Vertical/bifacial shines in snowy, high-albedo sites and for shoulder-hours → smoother output combats duck curve, higher winter yield, less snow cleaning.
  - Wind and structure are the gating factors → vertical panels act like sails; fence/zigzag mounts help — counterpoint: tempered glass and proper anchoring survive storms.
  - Fit to site and use → at high latitudes consider south-facing V; urban balconies/fences offer cheap “anywhere” kWh, though roof vertical mounting is awkward.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Model yield with albedo, latitude, and pricing; optimize for value-weighted kWh, not annual energy alone.
  - Impact: Grid operators benefit from flatter ramps; homeowners in snowy regions gain winter reliability and reduced maintenance.
  - Watch next: Independent yearlong datasets comparing vertical, east–west bifacial, and trackers; wind-code-rated mounting kits; time-of-use revenue analyses.
