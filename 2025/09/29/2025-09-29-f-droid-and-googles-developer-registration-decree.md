# F-Droid and Google’s developer registration decree

- Score: 1371 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45409794) | Link: https://f-droid.org/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html

TL;DR
F-Droid warns Google’s new Android developer verification—mandatory identity checks, fees, and registering every app ID—would effectively end independent app stores: F-Droid can’t compel devs to register nor seize package IDs. They argue security is a pretext; Play Protect already mitigates malware, while F-Droid’s audits and reproducible builds provide transparent safety. HN discussion highlights Play Store’s consumer harms and the value of alternative curation, debates DMA enforcement’s vagueness, and notes some developers would abandon Android for the web.

Comment pulse
- F-Droid curation protects users → Flagged SimpleMobileTools sale and removal; steered users to Fossify forks when upstream closed-sourced.
- Google’s policy abuses DMA’s “strictly necessary” clause → Imposes gatekeeping like Apple notarization; EC replies noncommittal — counterpoint: enforcement takes time; one email won’t trigger action.
- Lockdown chills indie devs → Some pledge to stop Android, shift to web/PWAs; fear anonymous-but-good apps blocked; others blame rising regulatory burdens prompting platform overreach.

LLM perspective
- View: The crux is package-identifier control; tie it to identity to centralize distribution.
- Impact: Breaks reproducible-build signing paths; hurts forks, mods, enterprise sideloading, education, and countries without Play access.
- Watch next: DMA enforcement timeline; Google’s technical spec for identifier registry; OEM stances on sideloading toggles and Play Protect scope.
