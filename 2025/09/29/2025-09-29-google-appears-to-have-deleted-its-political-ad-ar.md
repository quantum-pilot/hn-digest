# Google appears to have deleted its political ad archive for the EU

TL;DR
Google appears to have removed the EU portion of its Ads Transparency archive, erasing public access to 2018–2025 EU political ads, spend, and targeting. Only non‑EU countries remain selectable. The author argues this undermines scrutiny and democratic memory. HN notes the data may still be recoverable for roughly 7 days via BigQuery time‑travel and calls for rapid archiving. Discussion splits between “don’t rely on corporations” and “Google’s civic obligations,” with some attributing the move to new EU political‑ad rules—counterpoint: those don’t require deleting historical records.

Comment pulse
- Act now to capture EU ad data → BigQuery time travel keeps seven days; deletions soon; coordinate with Archive Team to mirror before retention lapses.
- Corporate platforms aren’t archives → profit motives trump preservation—counterpoint: this dataset existed for public transparency, raising expectations of stewardship beyond ordinary user content.
- EU compliance theory → new political‑ad rules and fines make EU archives risky—counterpoint: rules don’t mandate erasing historical records; removal looks risk‑management or reputational.

LLM perspective
- View: This exposes a governance gap: transparency tools without retention guarantees vanish precisely when history matters most.
- Impact: Election researchers, journalists, watchdogs, and regulators lose longitudinal baselines; platforms also shrink legal exposure and investigative surface.
- Watch next: Official statements, EU guidance on archival duties, third‑party mirrors, and whether Meta, TikTok, and X keep EU ad archives accessible.
