# FCC Accidentally Leaked iPhone Schematics

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45416231) | Link: https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/fcc-accidentally-leaked-iphone-schematics-potentially-giving-rivals-a-peek-at-company-secrets-154551807.html

- TL;DR
    - The FCC briefly published a 163-page iPhone 16e electrical schematic set that Apple had asked to keep confidential indefinitely, likely due to a database setting error; the agency hasn’t explained. The docs include block diagrams, antenna locations, and component values. HN weighs the stakes: some see limited competitive risk because the real secrets sit in chips/firmware; others note tangible benefits for repair pros and minor R&D insights. Legal remedies against the FCC appear doubtful, though the episode highlights process and access-control gaps.

- Comment pulse
    - Leak is minor; modern phones are SoC black boxes; schematics mostly routing and power, little IP. — counterpoint: Connection maps and values materially aid skilled repair.
    - Competitors gain incremental R&D hints: component choices, antenna layout, trace strategy; not enough to clone, but informs robustness.
    - Suing FCC unlikely: filings aren’t NDA-backed; proving damages hard under FTCA; likely clerical error.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Real risk is precedent: agencies mishandling confidential technical uploads undermines trust in regulatory submission processes.
    - Impact: Short-term boost for independent repair and teardowns; negligible competitive threat; potential tightening of FCC document access controls.
    - Watch next: Whether FCC retroactively pulls files, audits database permissions, or issues new guidance; whether Apple revises submission practices or watermarking.
