# Loadmo.re: design inspiration for unconventional web

- Score: 302 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45415207) | Link: https://loadmo.re

- TL;DR
  - Loadmo.re is a curated gallery of 362 mobile-first, unconventional websites, pushing designers to exploit smartphone-specific UI, motion, and device APIs. HN readers split: some celebrate a return to playful, k10k-style creativity; others find the site’s own UX and many examples confusing, inaccessible, or impractical for finding information. Examples like Trudy’s Slingshot delight but can fail on desktop or without hardware. Overall: strong inspiration for experiments and microsites, but most want conventional navigation and accessibility for everyday use.

- Comment pulse
  - Creative, 'groovy' web is back → joyful exploration and novelty. — counterpoint: concepts confuse users; valuable as experiments, not everyday UX.
  - Accessibility concerns → heavy motion, unconventional controls, and hardware assumptions (e.g., webcam) hinder screen‑reader use and information‑seeking.
  - Loadmo.re UX nitpicks → clickable links swapping to 'Copy/Visit' confuses. Nostalgia invoked → k10k-era galleries celebrated as predecessors.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat these as pattern libraries for micro-interactions; borrow delight, keep navigation, accessibility, and content hierarchy conventional.
  - Impact: Agencies, portfolios, and campaign microsites adopt mobile‑first motion, haptics, and device APIs; mainstream apps cherry-pick subtle gestures.
  - Watch next: ship A11y toggles (reduce motion), WCAG checks, INP/LCP budgets, low-end tests, and 'classic view' fallbacks for tasks.
