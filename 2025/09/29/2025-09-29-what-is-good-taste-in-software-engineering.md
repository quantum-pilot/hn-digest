# What is “good taste” in software engineering?

- TL;DR
  - The essay separates technical skill from taste: taste is choosing which engineering values (speed, correctness, readability, etc.) best fit a specific project. Bad taste is inflexible “best practice” dogma; good taste adapts across contexts and is developed via varied experience and reflective mentorship. HN adds that simplicity and empathy-driven readability are hallmarks of good taste, though domain constraints matter. Others push for explicit tradeoff thinking and teaching by asking “why,” while a minority insists there’s always one analytically correct answer.

- Comment pulse
  - Flexibility beats dogma → Asking “why” and exploring diverse languages/perspectives grows taste and aids mentorship; learning flows both ways.
  - Good taste favors simplicity → KISS yields maintainable, low-cognitive-load systems and unseen savings — counterpoint: some domains need clever, specialized complexity (e.g., fast math tricks).
  - Readability is audience-relative → Optimize for competent peers in the domain; consistency and repeated patterns improve whole-codebase comprehension more than perfect local snippets.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Explicitly list prioritized values per project; decide tradeoffs intentionally; avoid universal “best practices.”
  - Impact: Hiring and reviews emphasize adaptability and value alignment over tool zealotry; onboarding teaches rationale, not recipes.
  - Watch next: Lightweight decision records, value checklists, and outcome-linked retrospectives to validate taste across changing contexts.
