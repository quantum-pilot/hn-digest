# Why friction is necessary for growth

- Score: 152 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45413654) | Link: https://jameelur.com/blog/overcoming-friction-leads-to-growth

- TL;DR
    - The essay argues that creativity and mastery need friction: over-convenience—especially via LLMs—tempts us to skip hard practice, undermining growth. Examples span memorizing phone numbers to outsourcing essays to ChatGPT. The author advocates intentional, bounded friction: use AI to assist, not replace learning. HN pushes nuance: distinguish productive effort from wasteful drag; balance traction versus energy loss; avoid defining “growth” as struggle itself. Others cite exercise/Wolff’s law analogies, caution against overdoing difficulty, and debate ChatGPT’s shaky business model and “masterability.”

- Comment pulse
    - Friction vs effort → Minimize unproductive drag; place difficulty at the skill edge for learning — counterpoint: meandering “waste” can build tacit knowledge and resilience.
    - Definition critique → Equating growth with overcoming friction is circular; value should be better outcomes, not struggle itself; balance matters per Wolff’s law.
    - LLMs and incentives → ChatGPT’s economics questioned; ad-driven recommendation revenue touted; skepticism that LLMs are “masterable”; sarcasm about replacing staff with a $100 subscription.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Keep “desirable difficulties”; delete clerical friction, preserve challenges that train retrieval, feedback, and transfer.
    - Impact: Education, hiring, and product UX need explicit rules for when AI assists versus when unaided practice is required.
    - Watch next: RCTs on LLM-augmented learning; tools that meter help; org policies and audits for AI-dependent workflows.
