# Pop OS 24.04 LTS Beta

- Score: 378 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45384481) | Link: https://system76.com/pop/pop-beta/

- TL;DR
  - System76’s Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta debuts the in-house, Wayland-first COSMIC desktop (Epoch 1). It swaps key GNOME apps and Pop!_Shop for COSMIC alternatives, ships kernel 6.16.3, Mesa 25.1.5-1, and NVIDIA 580. Known gaps: no Wayland→X11 file drag-and-drop, missing display hotkeys/OSD, partial accessibility, Store add-ons absent, Text Editor printing pending; gaming is mostly fine via XWayland. HN welcomes multi‑monitor ergonomics and tiling with integrated settings, but criticizes long delays and stability hits during the 24.04 cycle.

- Comment pulse
  - COSMIC addresses GNOME gaps (multi-monitor top bar, per-monitor workspaces) → fewer extensions, saner defaults — counterpoint: fullscreen clock complaint is subjective; extensions suffice for some.
  - Tiling + integrated settings attract sway/i3 users → keyboard-driven WM, cohesive config, snappy feel, less tinkering than i3/sway or GNOME.
  - Delays eroded trust → 24.04 lingered on 22.04, unfixed bugs; some wanted a public skip to 26.04 and clearer timelines.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ambitious new-codebase DE hits beta with polished tiling and multi-monitor features, but Wayland interoperability and UX nits need hardening.
  - Impact: Easier OOTB Linux desktops; fewer GNOME extensions; potential sway/i3 migrations; more pressure on NVIDIA/Wayland support and third‑party app integration.
  - Watch next: RC fixes shipped, gaming/XWayland behavior, display OSD, accessibility coverage, Store add-ons, upgrade stability from 22.04, NVIDIA performance.
