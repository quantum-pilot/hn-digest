# US cities pay too much for buses

- Score: 183 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45386578) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/us-cities-are-paying-too-much-for-new-transit-buses

- TL;DR
    - US transit agencies reportedly overpay for buses. HN blames misaligned incentives—federal programs often cover ~80%—making local buyers price-insensitive and inviting customization and grift. Others cite Buy America rules, bundled maintenance, and genuine spec differences (climate, hills, corrosion) that raise costs and complicate comparisons. Some argue bus prices matter less than operations: driver wages dominate TCO; reliability and service frequency drive value. Cautionary tales (Proterra failures, hydrogen buses) show tech risk should be funded centrally, not borne by riders.

- Comment pulse
    - Misaligned incentives from 80% federal subsidy → local agencies less price-sensitive; customization and patronage creep in — counterpoint: federal oversight and competition should restrain excess.
    - Specs, Buy America, bundled services raise prices → climate, hills, sourcing rules add cost; orders lack scale — counterpoint: “bus is bus” skepticism.
    - Bus price is minor in TCO → driver wages dominate; reliability matters; tech bets (Proterra, hydrogen) hurt service and shouldn’t be funded by local agencies.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Standardize specs and pool procurement across agencies to regain scale while preserving a limited option list for climate/topography.
    - Impact: Lower capital costs, more reliable fleets, less admin churn; pressure domestic manufacturers to compete on price and service.
    - Watch next: Track GAO audits, Buy America waivers, multi-city RFPs, and price benchmarks versus Singapore/EU; quantify lifecycle costs including reliability.
