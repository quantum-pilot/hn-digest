- TL;DR
  - Jordan Mechner recounts how Prince of Persia jumped platforms in the early ’90s: Apple II as the handmade original; DOS/Windows as the widely remembered, upgraded standard; Amiga faithful; Macintosh delayed yet pivotal after a re-release; C64 canceled until fan ports decades later; and SNES a reimagined, longer adventure. He concludes the “best” version is the one you grew up with. HN readers recommend his development journals, connect his SNES surprise to the value of fresh eyes in code/design, and note standout fan ports on Atari 8‑bit.

- Comment pulse
  - Fresh eyes expose assumptions → SNES surprised the author; like code reviews revealing blind spots — counterpoint: authors playing expanded ports is richer than review.
  - Read Mechner’s journals → candid, process-rich diaries (rotoscoping, constraints) illuminate early PC/console development and personal stakes.
  - Fan port shout-out → Atari 8‑bit version praised as the best 8‑bit; Apple II remains the iconic baseline.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Technical constraints birthed distinct identities per platform; fidelity vs reinterpretation defines port success.
  - Impact: Open-sourcing assets enables high-quality fan ports decades later.
  - Watch next: Benchmark emulator latency and palettes; archive port toolchains; track re-release packaging effects on sales.
