# Evanston orders Flock to remove reinstalled cameras

- Score: 365 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45382434) | Link: https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/24/flock-safety-reinstalls-evanston-cameras/

- TL;DR
  Evanston ordered Flock Safety to remove reinstalled license-plate cameras after terminating its contract over alleged illegal CBP access to Illinois ALPR data. The city sent a cease‑and‑desist; Flock agreed to remove them. Flock’s transparency portal suggests cameras still logged vehicles post‑shutdown, implying unauthorized activity. A contract fight looms over $145,500 remaining. HN weighs accountability (charge executives), preemption vs state law, and ALPR ethics: mass‑tracking risks versus “automated cop eyeballs.” The city even bagged cameras pending removal.

- Comment pulse
  - Charge executives, not just fine firms → Alleged IL-law breaches and top-down ‘eliminate all crime’ culture from ex-staffer — counterpoint: federal preemption complicates sanctions.
  - Reinstalling likely backfires legally → Payment claims hinge on statutory compliance; an Illinois-law breach could void the contract regardless of continued service delivery.
  - Mass tracking exceeds plate purpose → Difference between suspect-plate alerts and storing everyone’s movements; traffic counts show one active camera could explain portal numbers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Cities need contractual kill-switches and physical control; vendors mustn’t operate hardware without explicit municipal authorization.
  - Impact: Expect tighter Illinois statutes, AG scrutiny, and insurer pressure; municipalities will renegotiate data-sharing and breach-termination clauses.
  - Watch next: Termination litigation, verification of portal metrics, and whether CBP access spurs statewide vendor restrictions.
