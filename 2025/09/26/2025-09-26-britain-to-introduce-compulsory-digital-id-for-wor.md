# Britain to introduce compulsory digital ID for workers

- Score: 330 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45381810) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-introduce-mandatory-digital-id-cards-2025-09-26/

- TL;DR
  - The UK’s Labour government will require a free digital ID for right-to-work checks by 2029, later expanding to public services. Framed as curbing illegal employment amid immigration pressures, it gains majority polling support but faces strong civil-liberties objections. HN critics highlight the UK’s surveillance laws, Palantir ties, and poor IT delivery, warning of centralization, mission creep, and exclusion of non‑smartphone users. Others cite convenient EU-style IDs, arguing trust, governance, and design—not the concept—determine outcomes.

- Comment pulse
  - Digital ID → centralized control, mission creep, revocation risk; UK’s IPA, Online Safety Act, Palantir ties, CCTV erode trust — counterpoint: physical ID cards seem benign.
  - Effectiveness questioned → right‑to‑work checks already exist; fraud uses forged documents; phone‑first risks exclusion and outages — counterpoint: denying work access may deter illegal migration.
  - Design matters → centralized attribute store feared; suggest verifiable credentials, offline fallbacks, zero‑knowledge proofs to minimize data; UK’s big‑IT track record raises reliability and abuse risks.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as digital KYC: minimal attributes, decentralized verifiable credentials, strict purpose limits, and immutable audit trails enforced in law.
  - Impact: Employers face new compliance tooling; undocumented workers pushed informal; non‑smartphone users risk exclusion unless strong offline alternatives exist.
  - Watch next: Specs to watch: offline mode, revocation safeguards, redress SLAs, W3C VC support, oversight body, and criminal penalties for unauthorized queries.
