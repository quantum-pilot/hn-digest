# Why use mailing lists?

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45390121) | Link: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/q6A_anL1u-Y9iXe-vboiOYamsl0/

- TL;DR
    - An IETF post defends mailing lists as durable, protocol-level infrastructure: client-agnostic, offline-friendly, push-based, interoperable, low-bandwidth, trivially archivable/searchable (mbox), portable, and resource-light—with fewer security/privacy pitfalls than web forums. HN largely agrees on openness and longevity but notes lists’ centralized moderation and address exposure; suggests NNTP and forum-email hybrids; laments migrations to Slack/Discord/WhatsApp that lose searchability and ownership. Practitioners describe HOA successes using lists to minimize support burden; nginx.org’s list shutdown highlights resilience risks and motivates alternative hosts/forks.

- Comment pulse
    - Open, non-proprietary communication → email lists meet accessibility/archival goals; forums can bridge email — counterpoint: lists aren’t federated; single-domain control centralizes moderation.
    - Operational simplicity for communities → HOAs prefer lists over Slack/FB to avoid accounts, password resets, and support; email automation suffices.
    - Privacy downside → participant addresses leak to scrapers; users mitigate with list-specific aliases/disposable addresses.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat lists as the backbone; add bridges (NNTP, RSS, web, Matrix) rather than replacing with siloed chats.
    - Impact: Improves knowledge retention, searchability, and inclusivity; reduces admin overhead for volunteer-run groups and heterogeneous user bases.
    - Watch next: Standardize portable archives and list APIs; privacy-preserving address masking; robust email-to-forum bridges; contingency plans when sponsors shut down lists.
