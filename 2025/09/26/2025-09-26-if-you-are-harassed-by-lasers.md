# If you are harassed by lasers

- Score: 100 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45389965) | Link: https://www.laserpointersafety.com/harassment.html

- TL;DR
    - Practical guide to “laser harassment”: verify the source before escalating. Many “laser” sightings are lens flare, sensor blooming, insects, or camera faults. Visible lasers can’t pass through walls; block light, gather photo/video evidence, involve police/PI if warranted, and seek medical evaluation for unexplained flashes/heat. Don’t escalate. The page catalogues incidents, debunks common misbeliefs, and notes Havana‑syndrome parallels. HN adds: tame intrusive LEDs, remember IR/high‑power lasers’ invisible risks, and use cameras to document real harassment.

- Comment pulse
    - Blinding indicator lights are a design bug → users tape/diffuse or ask neighbors; builders should dim/lightpipe LEDs.
    - IR/high‑power lasers can injure without pain → consumer power specs are unreliable; expertise can amplify risk — counterpoint: some military still use laser designators.
    - Helicopter noise fuels resentment → but aiming at aircraft is criminal; documenting with security cameras deterred harassers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat reports like diagnostics: rule out optical artifacts and medical causes before alleging malicious beams.
    - Impact: Encourages de‑escalation and evidence‑based reporting, reducing false accusations and needless police cycles.
    - Watch next: Better public guidance on camera artifacts; LED brightness standards; local policies on helicopter noise and laser enforcement.
