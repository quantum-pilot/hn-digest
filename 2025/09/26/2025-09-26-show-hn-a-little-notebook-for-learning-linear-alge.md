# Show HN: A little notebook for learning linear algebra with Python

- Score: 175 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45384617) | Link: https://little-book-of.github.io/linear-algebra/books/en-US/lab.html

- TL;DR
  - A code-first, NumPy/Matplotlib lab notebook that teaches linear algebra through short, executable exercises (vectors, operations, norms, dot product, angles, projections, inequalities, orthonormality), mirroring a broader 100-topic book. HN appreciates the “executable math” approach and pairing with the Little Book, suggests Marimo/PyTorch for interactivity, and wonders if it’s sufficient for ML. Critiques target limited abstraction (no formal vector-space definition) and a span plot that uses integer coefficients, which could mislead beginners. Covers basics with prompts and plots.

- Comment pulse
  - Executable math is great → code lets learners experiment; consider Marimo or PyTorch notebooks for interactivity — counterpoint: formatting/heaviness trade-offs remain.
  - Foundations vs abstraction → book favors R^n intuition; critics want formal vector-space definitions for “core ideas”.
  - Span visualization critique → integer-coefficient scatter may imply discrete span; better show full plane/coordinate-system idea.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Code-first labs work; add concise formal definitions to bridge intuition with abstract vector spaces.
  - Impact: Lowers barriers for ML, graphics, and data learners; complements 3Blue1Brown-style intuition with executable practice.
  - Watch next: Interactive widgets (Marimo), PyTorch 2 ports, numeric stability notes, and clear ML roadmaps beyond linear algebra.
