# Exploit allows for takeover of fleets of Unitree robots

- Score: 133 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45381590) | Link: https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit

- TL;DR
    - Researchers disclosed UniPwn, a wormable BLE-to-Wi‑Fi setup flaw in Unitree’s Go2/B2 quadrupeds and G1/H1 humanoids that enables root takeover and robot-to-robot spread. The bug chains hardcoded keys, trivial auth bypass, and command injection; Unitree hasn’t responded, despite prior security concerns. Suggested mitigations: disable Bluetooth, isolate networks. The episode spotlights robotics’ weak security culture and risks to public deployments (e.g., police trials). HN worries about “robot botnets,” demands hardware e‑stops, and debates incompetence versus intentional backdoors.

- Comment pulse
    - Robot botnets are dangerous → compromised mobiles can coordinate, unlike inert PCs. — counterpoint: disabling BLE and isolating networks reduces spread.
    - Mandate hardware e-stops → safety must be independent, non-updatable, and non-networked to prevent remote bypass.
    - Negligence vs malice debate → hardcoded keys look sloppy; others suspect backdoor; one asks what the AES screenshot actually proves.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Commissioning paths must be zero-trust; unique per-device keys, authenticated updates, and input sanitization are mandatory for mobile robots.
    - Impact: Vendors, integrators, and public agencies need SBOMs, coordinated disclosure, and hardwired e-stops; deployments may pause pending fixes and audits.
    - Watch next: Firmware patches and CVEs, cross-vendor BLE commissioning reviews, guidance from NIST/ENISA, and e-stop performance benchmarks in public trials.
