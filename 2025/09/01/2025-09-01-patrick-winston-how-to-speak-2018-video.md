- TL;DR
  Patrick Winston’s “How to Speak” remains a canonical primer on clear, persuasive talks: keep slides sparse, make yourself the show, rehearse, and use stories, props, and voice control to hold attention. HN recalls his broader communication ethos—network deliberately, write effusive recommendations, and respect audience cognition. Debate centers on slide minimalism versus shareable, text-rich decks and the role of listening. Many revisit the video to reset habits and avoid walls of text, tiny fonts, and unreadable tables.
  - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
  - Low-text slides boost focus → audience listens; shareable decks and code walkthroughs need text — counterpoint: don’t read slides; talk about them.
  - Winston blended AI with communication craft → practical rituals (voice warmups, networking cadence) and teaching touches (props, donuts) fostered lifelong habits.
  - “Speaking, writing, ideas—in that order” → some say listening is undervalued; others think speaking grows more decisive as AI commoditizes writing.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Communication mechanics beat slideware; structure, stories, rehearsal, and audience empathy routinely outperform dense decks.
  - Impact: Engineers, researchers, and teachers can measurably improve retention and persuasion with low-text visuals and practiced delivery.
  - Watch next: Run A/B talks varying slide text density; share notes-as-handout versions; adopt departmental speaking checklists and rehearsal norms.
