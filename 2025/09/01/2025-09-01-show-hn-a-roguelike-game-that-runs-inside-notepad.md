# Show HN: A roguelike game that runs inside Notepad++

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45088427) | Link: https://github.com/thelowsunoverthemoon/NeuroPriest

- TL;DR
  - NeuroPriest is a rogue-lite built as a Notepad++ plugin, turning the editor into a turn‑based game with six levels, relics, bosses, and audio. Install a bundled font, theme, and plugin manually, then launch from the menu; it’s 64‑bit Windows only, tested on Notepad++ 8.6.8, with a data‑loss warning. HN reacts: delightful hack, terminology nitpicks (roguelike vs roguelite), admiration for custom engines over big frameworks, and a plea to show screenshots first.

- Comment pulse
  - Rogue-like/rogue-lite labeling is inconsistent → marketing muddles genre definitions.
  - Hand‑rolled engine praised → tighter fit, less bloat than Unity/Unreal — counterpoint: portability, tooling, and maintenance suffer.
  - Put screenshots first → users bounce when visuals are buried.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Plugins as playful host apps show editors can be canvases, not just tools.
  - Impact: Highlights plugin ecosystems’ power and the need for better isolation to prevent data loss.
  - Watch next: Safer packaging, permission prompts, autosave/backup defaults; possible ports to other editors.
