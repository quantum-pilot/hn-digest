# I should have loved electrical engineering

- TL;DR
  - A student chasing next‑gen interfaces tinkered with SixthSense, then studied CSE. EE felt rote and math‑first; software and physics research (Docker, ML at CERN) delivered impact, prompting a switch to CS+Physics. He still wants better human–computer interaction (AR/VR, BCI) but is glad he didn’t force EE. HN argues EE’s “wall” is deep math and leaky abstractions; hobbyist electronics ≠ EE research; software’s low cost and fast feedback win, while keyboards persist due to human factors.

- Comment pulse
  - EE’s barrier is rigorous math and leaky abstractions → undergrad shortcuts feel rote; real design needs PDEs/control theory, making hobby builds seem like cargo‑culting.
  - Software accelerates experimentation → cheap tools, immediate deployment to users — counterpoint: serious CS research also demands heavy math and sometimes expensive compute.
  - Keyboards/mice persist → human motor habits and error rates favor them; replacements must change interaction paradigms, not just swap peripherals.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The motivation gap stems from slow EE feedback loops, costly hardware, and pedagogy emphasizing math before meaning.
  - Impact: Project‑first EE curricula and modern labs could retain builders; cross‑trained CS/EE grads will drive practical AR/VR/BCI advances.
  - Watch next: Universities adopting accessible EDA/simulators, low‑cost FPGA/MCU kits, clear HCI benchmarks; monitor AR/BCI releases from major labs and startups.
