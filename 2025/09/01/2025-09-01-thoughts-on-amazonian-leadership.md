# Thoughts on (Amazonian) leadership

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45095545) | Link: https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2025-09-01-Thoughts-on-Amazonian-Leadership.html

- TL;DR
  - An AWS Hero argues Amazon’s principles are sound but misapplied: “Customer Obsession” drifted from bold building blocks to chasing requests/analysts; AWS should ship resilience primitives (e.g., multi‑AZ durability) and fix cross‑AZ cost disincentives. “Ownership” should include ecosystem stewardship, yet secrecy/silos yield duplicate services. “Bias for Action” can erode trust; add “service bar raisers” to veto half‑baked launches. HN debates whether principles guide or are theater, whether “ownership” is fair without upside, and offers mixed insider views on silos and LPs’ real utility.

- Comment pulse
  - Principles are theater → incentives and promotions dominate; LPs get weaponized or ignored; values look like propaganda — counterpoint: teams use LPs to structure decisions.
  - ‘Leaders are owners’ shortchanges employees → minimal equity means little upside; stock incentives resemble a tragedy‑of‑commons — counterpoint: big‑tech cash comp justifies expecting ownership.
  - Silos vs stewardship → secrecy limits cross‑company awareness, spawning duplicates; ecosystem leadership urged — counterpoint: insiders say AWS alignment beats peers; LPs guide operations.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ship opinionated resilience building blocks and gate launches with cross-team technical councils; align pricing and principles to avoid perverse incentives.
  - Impact: Fewer half-baked services; stronger trust; easier multi‑AZ/multi‑region design for SMEs; less duplication via shared standards.
  - Watch next: Concrete: a Paxos/Raft‑as‑a‑service preview, cross‑AZ data egress price cuts, published launch-readiness checklists, and AWS participation in open virtualization standards.
