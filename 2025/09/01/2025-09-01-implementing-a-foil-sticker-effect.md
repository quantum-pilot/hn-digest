# Implementing a Foil Sticker Effect

- Score: 510 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45095460) | Link: https://www.4rknova.com/blog/2025/08/30/foil-sticker

- TL;DR
  - A custom Three.js shader renders a peelable holographic sticker in real time: view-angle hue shifts for iridescence, procedural “flake” sparkles via noise and perturbed normals, and Fresnel-modulated environment reflections. The vertex shader peels geometry with Rodrigues’ rotation and a fake AO; the fragment blends diffuse, env, flakes, and sRGB handling. A live demo exposes many tunables. HN discussion centers on web integration and prototyping, physics-based references, and sensor-driven shine on mobile. License is CC BY-NC.

- Comment pulse
  - Web integration is practical → Three.js and ShaderToy ease shader iteration; CSS-only effects like pokemon-cards-css work as lightweight fallbacks.
  - Physics-based routes exist → Metal-based implementations and Instagram’s “golden ticket” show higher realism — counterpoint: this post favors faster, art-directed approximations for the web.
  - Sensor-driven shine boosts immersion → Using phone orientation to modulate specular highlights mimics real tilt; iOS reportedly exposes this behavior for stickers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize plausible visuals over strict PBR; parameterize iridescence, flakes, and peel for art direction and performance.
  - Impact: Enables premium-looking cards, badges, and UI flourishes in WebGL; CC BY-NC restricts commercial reuse.
  - Watch next: WebGPU port, mobile power tests, env-map pipelines, device-motion controls, accessibility and battery-friendly fallbacks, and RWD integration.
