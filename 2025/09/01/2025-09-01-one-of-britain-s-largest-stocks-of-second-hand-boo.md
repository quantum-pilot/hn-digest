- TL;DR
    - Bookseller Richard Axe amassed 150,000+ antiquarian and second‑hand books across 25 rooms in a former Yorkshire youth hostel. His model: buy whole libraries at auctions, sell a few high‑value items, keep the rest—benefiting from the internet’s price polarization (common titles down, true rarities/unique items up). Now in his 70s and unwell, he’s selling the building plus stock for ~£1.5m and hopes it stays intact. HN debates the glut of ordinary books, eBay’s market reset, and the fate of the “great middle” of out‑of‑print works.

- Comment pulse
    - Estate bulk is hard to rehome → time, space, and logistics; fairs and free stores help but can’t absorb volume.
    - Internet reset valuations → ISBN-era titles abundant; value shifts to pre‑ISBN, unique items, and condition; many shops closed.
    - Physical books still matter → serendipity and offline knowledge; — counterpoint: most books aren’t precious; recycling is fine.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Sell intact to an institution/foundation; treat it as a public-access archive plus curated resale program.
    - Impact: Preserves regional and niche out-of-print material; creates a destination archive benefiting local tourism and scholarship.
    - Watch next: Buyer named; inventory catalog published; plan for selective digitization and a transparent deaccession policy.
