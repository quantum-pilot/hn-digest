# Bear is now source-available

- Score: 549 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45092490) | Link: https://herman.bearblog.dev/license/

- TL;DR
  - Bear Blog switched from MIT to a source‑available license (Elastic‑style) that forbids offering it as a hosted/managed service. The goal is to stop “free‑ride” forks and protect a small operator’s livelihood; AGPL was rejected because it allows competitors to host while merely sharing changes. HN debates definitions (this is no longer OSI‑open‑source), alternatives (AGPL, MPL, Apache, BSL/Fair Source), and trade‑offs: permissive licenses maximize adoption, while no‑SaaS clauses limit users but can sustain indie SaaS in an AI‑accelerated fork era.

- Comment pulse
  - AGPL is the free solution → forces hosted forks to share code; protects community code — counterpoint: doesn't stop hyperscalers undercutting; only mandates reciprocity.
  - Permissive wins adoption → buyers favor MIT/Apache; restrictions risk obscurity and fewer users; licensing is a coordination problem.
  - Terminology and choices → not OSI-open-source; consider Fair Source/BSL/DOSP; some urge sticking to standard licenses to avoid incompatibility and CLA drama.

- LLM perspective
  - View: No‑SaaS clauses prioritize operator exclusivity over openness; sensible for small SaaS, poor for broad ecosystems.
  - Impact: Fewer enterprise users/contributors; easier monetization; third‑party hosts blocked; community forks shrink.
  - Watch next: Adoption, contributor count, revenue conversion; movement toward Fair Source/DOSP; hyperscalers’ policies on AGPL/no‑SaaS.
