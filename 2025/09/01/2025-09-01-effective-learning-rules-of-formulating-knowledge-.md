# Effective learning: Rules of formulating knowledge (1999)

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45093022) | Link: https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge

- TL;DR
  - Piotr Wozniak’s classic outlines 20 rules for turning knowledge into durable memories with spaced repetition: prioritize comprehension and basics, apply the minimum-information principle, favor cloze/graphic deletions, avoid sets/enumerations, reduce interference, and use context, personalization, emotion, sources, timestamps, and prioritization. HN readers credit the essay and Anki with academic breakthroughs (especially in medicine). Many have moved from SuperMemo to open-source Anki+FSRS, yet praise SuperMemo’s unmatched incremental reading—sometimes keeping a Windows VM. Mentions of the SuperMemo.guru site and that AI-made cards are often too wordy.

- Comment pulse
  - Anki/FSRS replaced SuperMemo for many → open-source, cross‑platform, plugins; yet SM’s incremental reading keeps power users on Windows — counterpoint: Anki derives from Wozniak’s ideas.
  - Wozniak’s rules + Anki changed careers → clearer study habits raised performance; setup demands discipline; deep understanding still works for less memorization‑heavy fields.
  - SuperMemo.guru recommended → deep spaced‑repetition content; site struggled under HN traffic. Also: AI-generated cards are too wordy → share these rules to improve prompts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: The core is decomposing knowledge into minimal, interference-resistant items; LLMs can enforce these constraints when generating cards.
  - Impact: Better prompts/templates yield concise cloze items, less interference, and scheduler-friendly decks across Anki/SM/RemNote.
  - Watch next: Benchmark AI-generated decks by retention, review time, and leech rate; release open datasets and card-quality validators.
