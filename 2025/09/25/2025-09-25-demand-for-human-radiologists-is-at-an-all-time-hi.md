# Demand for human radiologists is at an all-time high

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45372335) | Link: https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists

- TL;DR
    - Radiology seems ripe for automation—standardized images and 700+ FDA-cleared tools—but demand and salaries keep rising. Benchmarks overstate clinical performance; models generalize poorly across hospitals, cover narrow findings, and can mislead clinicians. Regulation and malpractice insurers limit autonomy; retraining triggers reapproval; adoption is mostly assistive, with modest success. Complementarity and elastic demand mean faster tools increase imaging volume, while radiologists still handle oversight, communication, and procedures. Net: better AI has made radiologists busier, not obsolete.

- Comment pulse
    - Clinician view: AI may read as well or better, but legal sign-off and malpractice risk make validation the bottleneck—counterpoint: a perfect oracle would obviate radiologists.
    - Edge cases analogy: like self‑driving, impressive demos hide rare-but-critical failures; the stubborn “last 2%” blocks autonomy and keeps humans in the loop.
    - Pipeline/economics: vacancies rise as med students hedge against future automation; others note many radiologists mainly read images, so perfect AI would erase the role.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Build end-to-end, guardrailed autonomy for narrow indications with clear ROI; integrate into RIS/PACS and billing.
    - Impact: Increases triage speed and coverage; shifts radiologists toward oversight, interventional work, and clinician communication.
    - Watch next: OOD benchmarks becoming required, CPT codes/reimbursement for AI, malpractice shared-liability endorsements, first autonomous CT/MRI reads.
