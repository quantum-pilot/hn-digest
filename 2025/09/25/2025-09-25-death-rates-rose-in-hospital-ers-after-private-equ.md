# Death rates rose in hospital ERs after private equity firms took over

- Score: 709 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45372442) | Link: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-rates-rose-hospital-ers-private-equity-firms-took-study-finds-rcna233211

- TL;DR
    - A Harvard-led study of 1M Medicare ED visits (2009–2019) found 13% higher emergency-department mortality after private equity hospital takeovers versus matched peers, alongside 11.6% fewer FTEs and 18%/16% ER/ICU pay cuts—pointing to staffing reductions. HN links this to broader PE-driven quality declines and price markups, calls for limits on debt/ownership and transparency, and debates deregulation vs regulatory capture. Others flag physician replacement by NPs/PAs and its training gap. States like Oregon and Indiana are tightening oversight.

- Comment pulse
    - PE hospital takeovers harm outcomes → ER/ICU staffing and pay cuts track higher ED mortality; calls for bans or tighter oversight.
    - Distorted market is root → restricted competition and capture enable profiteering; regulate debt-loading/dividend recaps, boost transparency — counterpoint: specify which “overregulation” should actually be repealed.
    - Midlevel substitution risk → replacing physicians with NPs/PAs may hurt outcomes; training gap ≈15,000 vs 500–1,500 supervised hours cited.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Target staffing-sensitive metrics; tie ownership changes to mandatory ER/ICU staffing floors and real-time quality monitoring.
    - Impact: Boards, payers, and regulators may cap leverage, require disclosure of PE control, and penalize mortality spikes after acquisitions.
    - Watch next: Replication beyond Medicare, post-2019 trends, patient-mix controls, effects of Oregon/Indiana laws, and public high-markup hospital lists.
