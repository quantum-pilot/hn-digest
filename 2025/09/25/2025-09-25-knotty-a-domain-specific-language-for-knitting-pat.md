# Knotty: A domain-specific language for knitting patterns

- Score: 330 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45369768) | Link: https://t0mpr1c3.github.io/knotty/index.html

- TL;DR
  - Knotty is a Racket-based domain‑specific language to author knitting patterns, with docs covering pattern construction, I/O and examples. HN jokes about the missed name “Purl,” then pivots to automation: industrial knitting is programmable, but robotic crochet remains hard; generative AI could propose patterns for machines. Historical context surfaces via Jacquard looms and punched cards, with debate over whether that counts as computation. Overall, readers see promise in algorithmic representations that bridge handcrafts with programmable fabrication.

- Comment pulse
  - Knitting automation feasible; crochet is harder → Industrial knitters exist; robotic crochet needs vision/planning; non-grid stitch maps hint at algorithmic representations.
  - Jacquard loom as early computer → Punched cards controlled patterns; lineage predates Jacquard; museum examples inspire — counterpoint: control isn’t computation.
  - Practical DSLs shine → Knotty evokes LilyPond’s text-to-art ethos; Racket sweet-expressions offer indentation-based S-expr syntax for readability.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Text DSLs for crafts enable reproducibility, version control, parametrization, and testing beyond ad‑hoc pattern PDFs.
  - Impact: Open, parsable patterns can feed visualizers, simulators, and machine knitters; educators gain programmable examples.
  - Watch next: Exports to machine formats, constraint checking (gauge, yarn), stitch-map layouts, and AI pattern linting with human review.
