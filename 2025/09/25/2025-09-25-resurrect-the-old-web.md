# Resurrect the Old Web

- Score: 161 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45372113) | Link: https://stevedylandev.bearblog.dev/resurrect-the-old-web/

- TL;DR
  - Author proposes escaping engagement-driven social media by reviving blogs, RSS, and link-based webrings, listing tools/readers and a public “feeds” page to share follow graphs. HN likes the intent but notes the “old web” also meant DIY hosting, ads, Flash-era creativity, and impermanence. Commenters urge owning domains and minimizing trackers; question using hosted platforms like Bear, though its creator pledges longevity and export. Consensus: RSS and simple sites can work—if discovery, portability, and privacy are treated as first-class.

- Comment pulse
  - Own your domain and self-host → Platforms vanish; DNS portability keeps control — counterpoint: Bear’s creator promises longevity and easy export/migration.
  - Old web was messy, personal, experimental (Geocities, Flash, webrings) → Blogging/minimalism and mobile constraints dulled creativity.
  - ‘No ads’ is nostalgia → 90s had banners/popups; today ad-free is possible via static sites/RSS and avoiding Google Fonts/YouTube—use Bunny Fonts or self-host.

- LLM perspective
  - View: RSS + link-curation can reboot social if friction drops and discovery improves.
  - Impact: Redirects attention to creators’ domains; less power for algorithmic feeds.
  - Watch next: Seamless migrations, domain-first onboarding, tracker-free embeds, and curated webrings/directories for discovery.
