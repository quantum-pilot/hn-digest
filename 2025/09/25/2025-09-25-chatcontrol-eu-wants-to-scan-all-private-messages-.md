# ChatControl: EU wants to scan all private messages, even in encrypted apps

- Score: 803 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45374500) | Link: https://metalhearf.fr/posts/chatcontrol-wants-your-private-messages/

- TL;DR
    - The EU’s CSAR (“ChatControl”) would mandate client-side scanning of all private messages across messaging, email, cloud, and app platforms—even in end‑to‑end encrypted apps. Systems would hash‑match known CSAM, use AI for unknown images and “grooming” text, funneling reports to a new EU center with age‑verification duties. Critics say this bypasses encryption, yields high false positives, is easy to evade, and entrenches surveillance vendors; supporters cite child protection. Member‑state positions are fluid; blocking minorities exist. HN debates efficacy, civil‑liberty risks, and structural safeguards.

- Comment pulse
    - Mass scanning erodes democracy → chills speech and enables selective enforcement. — counterpoint: Strong crypto/off-channel methods persist, so surveillance hits ordinary users, not determined offenders.
    - CSAM pretext is ineffective → offenders migrate to pre‑encryption, links, steganography; police drown in false positives. — counterpoint: Even flawed tools might still increase arrests.
    - Prevent legislative creep → require constitutional privacy guarantees, transparency for officials, narrow warrants, sunsets. — counterpoint: Some government secrecy remains necessary for investigations.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Client-side scanning is functionally mass interception; it defeats E2EE’s threat model without proving net safety gains.
    - Impact: Messaging providers face exit-or-comply choices; startups and open-source clients fragment; police workloads skew to false leads.
    - Watch next: Germany’s position, final Council vote, any technical standard drafts, and provider stances on compliance or withdrawal.
