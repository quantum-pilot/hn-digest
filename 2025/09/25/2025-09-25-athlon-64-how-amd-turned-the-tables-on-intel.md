# Athlon 64: How AMD turned the tables on Intel

- Score: 176 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45376605) | Link: https://dfarq.homeip.net/athlon-64-how-amd-turned-the-tables-on-intel/

- TL;DR
    - In 2003 AMD’s Athlon 64 extended x86 to 64‑bit (AMD64), betting on full backward compatibility and strong 32‑bit perf/watt. That won desktops and data centers—Dell adopted Opteron as Prescott ran hot—and forced Intel to clone it (EM64T/Intel64), sidelining Itanium. HN adds: Intel had an internal P4 x86‑64 it disabled to protect Itanium; customers valued “my apps run” over cleaner designs; Itanium’s IA‑32 emulation lagged native x86. Bottom line: compatibility + efficiency beat a risky clean‑slate.

- Comment pulse
    - Intel built P4 x86‑64 (Yamhill) → management fused it off to shield Itanium; Microsoft later favored AMD64 — counterpoint: AMD64 added registers, and P4 underperformed.
    - Compatibility won → Itanium broke x86, arrived late/slow, and alienated RISC loyalists targeted by Intel/HP marketing, depressing adoption.
    - Intel first branded its AMD64 clone EM64T → Itanium’s IA‑32 Execution Layer used DBT + microcode, faster than emulation yet far behind native x86.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Compatibility plus immediate perf/watt wins can beat architecturally elegant clean-slate designs.
    - Impact: Forced Intel to standardize on AMD64, shifted server procurement to perf/watt, and locked decades of software investment into x86-64.
    - Watch next: APX adoption across Intel/AMD, compiler/OS support, and ARM/Windows competition pressuring x86 to add features or simplify legacy.
