# Raspberry Pi 500+

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45370304) | Link: https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ultimate-all-in-one-pc-raspberry-pi-500-plus-on-sale-now-at-200/

- TL;DR
    - Raspberry Pi 500+ is a $200 keyboard PC built on Pi 5: 2.4GHz Cortex‑A76, 16GB RAM, dual 4K micro‑HDMI, Wi‑Fi, and the first Pi with built‑in NVMe—an internal 256GB M.2 (replaceable). It adds a per‑key RGB mechanical keyboard (Gateron KS‑33 Blue, RP2040/QMK). A $220 kit bundles PSU, mouse, HDMI cable, guide. HN notes performance matches Pi 5 16GB; NVMe boosts I/O, and eGPU works with an AMD driver patch. Debates center on “all‑in‑one” naming, micro‑HDMI, loud switches, and optional RGB.

- Comment pulse
    - Performance ≈ Pi 5 16GB; NVMe speeds some tasks; eGPU acceleration works via small AMD driver patch — counterpoint: still not “premium desktop” class.
    - “All‑in‑one” label disputed: you still need a display and mouse, adding cost — counterpoint: intended to plug into the household TV, 1980s‑style.
    - Keyboard polarizing: clicky Gateron Blues praised by some; others want quieter reds/browns, hot‑swap options, layout/color variants; per‑key RGB can be disabled.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A refined, low‑power desktop-in-a-keyboard; great for education, kiosks, retro projects, light dev—not heavy compute.
    - Impact: Educators and hobbyists get simpler NVMe setups; OEMs can build cleaner appliances; Pi ecosystem normalizes PCIe peripherals and storage.
    - Watch next: N100 mini‑PC comparisons, upstream AMD eGPU support, sustained‑load thermals, and SKUs with quieter switches or without preinstalled NVMe.
