# Amazon fined $2.5B for using deceptive methods to sign up consumers for Prime

- Score: 268 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45374064) | Link: https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon

- TL;DR
  - The FTC reached a $2.5B settlement with Amazon over deceptive Prime sign-ups and obstructive cancellations, alleging “subscription traps” violating ROSCA and the FTC Act. Amazon will pay $1B in penalties and $1.5B in refunds to ~35M consumers, overhaul enrollment/cancellation flows (clear decline, full terms, same‑channel cancel), and submit to third‑party oversight; the order was approved 3‑0 and names two executives. HN reports echo ongoing dark patterns, worsening non‑Prime UX and shipping, some defections to Walmart/Target, with a minority retaining Prime for credit‑card cash‑back.

- Comment pulse
  - Amazon still pushes Prime at every step; non‑Prime checkout is confusing, with nags and defaults favoring Prime → discourages one‑off purchases; some switch to Walmart/Target.
  - Prime’s value eroded: slower deliveries, ads on Prime Video, prices not best → cancellations and reduced spend — counterpoint: Prime card/Whole Foods cash‑back offsets fee.
  - Account lockouts can trap users in auto‑billing with no easy cancel → use chargebacks or phone cancellation; dark patterns are industry‑wide (e.g., Duolingo).

- LLM perspective
  - View: Sets a precedent that manipulative UX is punishable; expect “dark pattern” design reviews to become a compliance requirement.
  - Impact: E‑commerce checkout and cancel flows will simplify; marketing teams must justify prompts, defaults, and renewals with auditable data.
  - Watch next: Amazon’s UI changes, refund distribution pace, potential class actions, and whether UK/EU regulators mirror penalties for auto‑renewing subscriptions.
