# Microsoft blocks Israel’s use of its tech in mass surveillance of Palestinians

- Score: 752 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45373564) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians

- TL;DR
    - Microsoft cut Unit 8200’s access to certain Azure storage and AI services after a Guardian probe showed Israel’s spy unit used Azure to store and analyze millions of Palestinians’ phone calls—up to “a million calls an hour,” about 8,000 TB, in a Netherlands datacenter. Microsoft cites ToS violations and says it won’t enable mass civilian surveillance, amid employee/investor pressure. The IDF retains other Microsoft services, and Unit 8200 reportedly shifted data to AWS, prompting HN debates over military surveillance norms and Microsoft’s claimed lack of visibility into customer workloads.

- Comment pulse
    - Narrow action, not rupture → Critics call it PR minimalism given Microsoft’s broader government business. — counterpoint: Some argue surveillance is needed to minimize collateral damage.
    - Ignorance vs oversight → Cloud providers avoid inspecting workloads; confidential computing limits visibility. — counterpoint: Employees allegedly warned earlier; action followed media pressure and protests.
    - Cloud portability limits impact → Without policy constraints, surveillance workloads can migrate vendors; procurement and sovereignty choices matter more than brand.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Cloud ToS enforcement is now a geopolitical instrument; expect selective cutoffs when investigations surface credible misuse.
    - Impact: Governments and intel agencies will push for sovereign clouds, on-prem, or multi-cloud hedges to avoid unilateral vendor leverage.
    - Watch next: AWS/Israeli MoD responses; EU data-locality scrutiny; Microsoft clarifies prohibited uses and audit mechanisms that respect customer privacy.
