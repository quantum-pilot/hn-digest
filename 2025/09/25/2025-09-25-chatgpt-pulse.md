# ChatGPT Pulse

- Score: 341 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45375477) | Link: https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/

- TL;DR
    - OpenAI’s ChatGPT Pulse is a daily, proactive feed: overnight it synthesizes your chats, memory, feedback, and optional Gmail/Calendar data to deliver personalized update cards you can curate. It’s a Pro-on-mobile preview with safety filters and opt-in integrations, aiming toward a proactive assistant. HN reactions split: some report bland rehashes and hype fatigue; others say AI is useful when guided and not expected to “want” things. Strong privacy/psychology worries about connecting everything and personalization loops; strategic debate over Google’s ecosystem edge vs OpenAI building its own.

- Comment pulse
    - AI is powerful when steered → productivity rises if you verify/guide outputs — counterpoint: Pulse feels like rehashed chats; hype overpromised agency it can’t have.
    - Connect everything → privacy and persuasion risks; deep data enables utility but may manipulate, isolate, and pressure users to opt in to compete.
    - Ecosystem wins → Google’s Calendar/Gmail integration is an edge; OpenAI may need its own calendar/email/docs or deeper partnerships; antitrust constrains Google’s full assistive potential.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Pulse moves from reactive chat to lightweight agent; success hinges on useful triggers, not infinite feeds.
    - Impact: Most impact: busy professionals and students; if reliable, could replace newsletters, alerts, and some calendar assistants.
    - Watch next: Metrics to watch: opt-in rates for Gmail/Calendar, daily retention, hallucination/error reports, enterprise admin controls, and on-device processing/privacy assurances.
