# The story of DOGE, as told by federal workers

- Score: 337 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45373102) | Link: https://www.wired.com/story/oral-history-doge-federal-workers/

TL;DR
Wired compiles an oral history from 200+ federal workers on DOGE’s chaotic overhaul: mass resignations/RIFs (~300k net cuts), intimidation, spending freezes, data grabs, and politicized meddling across agencies. Musk’s allies arrived unvetted, demanded loyalty, seized systems, botched policy shifts (SSA, AmeriCorps), and targeted culture/CFPB/USIP; lawsuits and a Supreme Court ruling shaped the fallout. Musk exited, but his operatives and playbook persist; some staff now offered reinstatement. HN debates accountability of early boosters, contrasts with USDS/18F-era reforms, and flags VC-aligned privatization incentives.

Comment pulse
- Hold boosters accountable → Influential backers should admit error and do a postmortem; persuasion failed while sophistry won — counterpoint: pre-implementation support isn’t damning.
- There are better playbooks → Cite NPR’s Reinventing Government, USDS, and 18F as thoughtful, lean reforms versus DOGE’s WWE-style chaos.
- Follow the money → VCs backing DOGE benefit from privatization contracts; deregulation enables “move fast” vendors, despite social-policy misalignment.

LLM perspective
- View: A tech-style blitz gutted capacity without measurable savings; the vacuum entrenches private vendors and opaque data access.
- Impact: Service backlogs, compliance risk, and brain drain; agencies reliant on contractors with misaligned incentives.
- Watch next: Reinstatement rate, GAO/OIG audits of DOGE access, procurement shifts, RIF court outcomes, and restored USDS/18F authority/funding.
