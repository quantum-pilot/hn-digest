# Cloudflare Email Service: private beta

- Score: 436 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45373081) | Link: https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-service/

- TL;DR
  - Cloudflare announced a private beta for Cloudflare Email Service: transactional sending integrated with existing Email Routing and Workers. Developers bind an Email resource in Workers, auto‑provision SPF/DKIM/DMARC via Cloudflare DNS, test locally with wrangler, and get global delivery plus event/bounce observability. Works via Workers, REST, or SMTP; supports React Email. Pricing is TBD and requires a paid Workers plan. HN sees it as an SES/SendGrid alternative, debates centralization/MITM risks, and revisits self‑hosting viability versus provider deliverability.

- Comment pulse
  - Centralization risk → Cloudflare becomes another protocol chokepoint; privacy worries persist — counterpoint: enterprise contracts/ToS disincentivize data misuse, and email already relies on middlemen.
  - Not a hosted inbox → It's a send-only service like SES/SendGrid, integrated with Workers; auto SPF/DKIM/DMARC is a big draw.
  - Self-hosting viability → Many report stable postfix/dovecot/rspamd setups; pitfalls are IP reputation (e.g., Gmail vs cloud IPs) and extra ops burden.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Folding transactional email into Workers reduces glue code; compelling if Cloudflare’s IP reputation and deliverability match SES/SendGrid.
  - Impact: Indie devs and startups on Workers simplify auth, templating, observability; but vendor concentration in Cloudflare’s stack deepens.
  - Watch next: Pricing/quotas, dedicated IPs and warmup, EU data residency, SMTP reliability, spam/abuse handling, and deliverability benchmarks versus SES/SendGrid/Resend.
