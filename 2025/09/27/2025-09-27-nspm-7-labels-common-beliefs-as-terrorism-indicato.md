# NSPM-7 labels common beliefs as terrorism 'indicators'

- Score: 88 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398719) | Link: https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs

- TL;DR
  - NSPM-7, a published national security directive, orders DOJ/FBI/JTTFs to preempt “left-wing” political violence using broad “indicators” (anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, anti-Christianity, and issue “extremism”). It emphasizes speech monitoring, omits First Amendment guardrails, and leverages existing JTTFs—minimizing new oversight. Critics see a partisan extension of post‑9/11 pre-crime tactics into domestic politics; supporters frame it as disrupting radicalization before violence. HN discussion focuses on practical pushback limits, historical analogs, and curbing surveillance authorities like the Patriot Act.

- Comment pulse
  - Impeachment won’t happen → 67 Senate votes are unattainable; “Trumpism” outlasts Trump via a durable base and successors.
  - Suppression debate → Streisand effect boosts targeted ideas — counterpoint: authoritarian systems can chill speech by enforcing punitive lines; the US isn’t immune.
  - Roll back surveillance → Repeal the Patriot Act and limit JTTF scope to prevent pre-crime mission creep into protected speech.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Vague “indicators” convert counterterrorism into political-policing; investigative thresholds may drop from acts to speech adjacency.
  - Impact: Universities, NGOs, donors, and platforms risk scrutiny; local police on JTTFs become conduits for federal intelligence priorities.
  - Watch next: DOJ guidance language, FOIA-able metrics, early test cases, injunctions, and state AGs’ directives to limit local cooperation.
