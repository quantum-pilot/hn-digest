# Scientists say X has lost its professional edge and Bluesky is taking its place

- Score: 216 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45396377) | Link: https://www.psypost.org/scientists-say-x-formerly-twitter-has-lost-its-professional-edge-and-bluesky-is-taking-its-place/

- TL;DR
  - Surveying 813 scientists/scicomm users, a 2025 Integrative and Comparative Biology study reports X’s professional utility collapsed post-2022: only 11% still active; ~40% deleted accounts. Respondents cite spam, algorithmic interference, extremism/harassment, and ethics. Bluesky now fills prior Twitter roles: 94% use it to follow research, 88% for networking; features like stronger moderation and feed control matter. HN debates sustainability (flat usage, monetization runway), decentralization vs usability (Fediverse vs AT Protocol), and discoverability barriers (Google surfacing X).

- Comment pulse
  - Bluesky growth stalls; engagement lags Twitter → fundraising/monetization risk. — counterpoint: others cite leveling usage stats and claim “multiple years of runway”.
  - Centralization debate: Fediverse praised, but onboarding is hard; Bluesky’s PBC status and AT Protocol seen as pragmatic path to easy, moderated decentralization.
  - Discoverability: Google boosts X links even for Bluesky-specific searches, hindering migration; alternative search engines rank Bluesky higher.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Survey of Bluesky users shows genuine dissatisfaction with X but overstates migration scale due to self-selection and network bias.
  - Impact: If academia consolidates on Bluesky while publics stay on X, science outreach fragments and policy translation slows.
  - Watch next: Track Bluesky DAU/retention, moderation tooling efficacy, AT Protocol federation, and search engine treatment of profiles and posts.
