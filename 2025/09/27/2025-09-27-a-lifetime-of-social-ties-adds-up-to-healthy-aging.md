# A lifetime of social ties adds up to healthy aging

- TL;DR
  - Drawing on 2,100 MIDUS participants, Cornell researchers found that lifelong “cumulative social advantage”—parental warmth, community belonging, religious involvement, and ongoing support—correlates with slower epigenetic aging (GrimAge, DunedinPACE) and lower IL‑6. Short‑term stress hormones didn’t budge. The study frames social connection as a compounding resource that also reflects inequality, echoing weathering. HN readers debated friendlessness vs meaningful confidants, the role of structured communities (AA, church) in recovery, and whether the findings are obvious versus mechanistically actionable.

- Comment pulse
  - Quality beats quantity in friendship → one confidant for hard topics can matter more than many acquaintances; screens rarely substitute deep ties.
  - Structured communities aid addiction recovery → routine and belonging replace triggers; alcohol helps mingle but practice lowers social inhibition long-term.
  - It feels obvious: belonging lowers stress → less wear-and-tear — counterpoint: study saw no association with cortisol/catecholamines; IL‑6 dropped instead.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat social connection as a modifiable health exposure, not just lifestyle fluff.
  - Impact: Primary care, employers, cities could screen and invest in connection-building programs; target groups with compounding disadvantage.
  - Watch next: Randomized trials of social interventions, causality via natural experiments/MR, and biomarkers beyond IL‑6 to map pathways.
