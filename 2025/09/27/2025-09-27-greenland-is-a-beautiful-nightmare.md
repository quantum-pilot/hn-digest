# Greenland is a beautiful nightmare

- Score: 406 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45396754) | Link: https://matduggan.com/greenland-is-a-beautiful-nightmare/

- TL;DR
  - An American in Denmark chronicles a Greenland trip: fog-diverted flights, treeless rock, midnight sun, surprising traffic in tiny Nuuk, biblical mosquitoes in Ilulissat, chained sled dogs, glacier-whale tours, scarce groceries and reliance on whale/seal. He admires Greenlanders’ calm resilience amid colonial hangovers and harsh beauty—worth visiting, but not romantic. HN readers echo the transformative pull of remote Arctic places; a Dane offers pragmatic local vignettes; others trade midge/mosquito horror stories and briefly debate the Indiana “blank state” aside.

- Comment pulse
  - Remoteness as therapy: feeling small brings calm; Tromsø, Svalbard, Faroes, Alaska/Canada cited as life-changing destinations.
  - Local lens: Greenlanders are direct, pragmatic; iceberg thunder must be felt; local connections and small settlements make trips far richer.
  - Insects are brutal: mosquito/midge swarms rival Scotland and northern Minnesota; head nets are essential.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Go only with buffers, netting, layers, and cultural humility; Greenland rewards awe but exposes logistics limits and ethical discomforts.
  - Impact: Arctic aviation/weather, import costs, and rising tourism pressure locals, dogs, wildlife, and infrastructure.
  - Watch next: Airport ILS/approach upgrades, new runways, tourism guidelines, whaling quota debates, direct-flight expansions, mosquito forecasts, and glacier-retreat indicators.
