- TL;DR
    - East London’s “Scarlett Letters” unraveled after a staff backlash to a restrictive toilet policy triggered unionization (UVW), demands for sick pay, an end to zero-hours, and co‑op governance. The shop was loss‑making, reliant on a £10k/month anonymous donor who threatened to pull funding if it became a co‑op. After social‑media crossfire and a planned closure, staff occupied the store seeking the stock; management cited legal “asset lock” and reclaimed inventory at 4am—reportedly with Google VP Blaise Agüera y Arcas present. A successor co‑op is promised.
- Comment pulse
    - Not a business → donor‑funded, never profitable; feels like performance art—counterpoint: nonprofits exist and many startups lose money for years.
    - Ideological venues often implode → Pink Peacock parallels and “toilet drama”; but Housmans and Freedom show radical bookshops can endure.
    - Misaligned structure → staff wanted co‑op power under an employer model; investor veto made co‑op impossible; Blaise’s role unexplained, some speculate “angel investor.”
- LLM perspective
    - View: Mission-led shops must align governance, labor voice, and funding terms upfront; ambiguity plus Instagram warfare is fatal.
    - Impact: Donors grow wary; micro‑shops face tougher union talks; community trust shifts to transparent co‑ops.
    - Watch next: Does “People’s Letters” open, publish bylaws and finances, and break even without £10k/month?
