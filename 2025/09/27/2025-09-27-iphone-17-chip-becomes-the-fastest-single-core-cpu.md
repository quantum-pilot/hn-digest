# iPhone 17 chip becomes the fastest single-core CPU in the world on PassMark

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398802) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apples-a19-becomes-the-fastest-single-core-cpu-in-the-world-on-passmark-beating-pc-chips-and-apples-own-m3-ultra-passively-cooled-iphone-17-chip-catapults-past-power-hungry-competitors

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s A19 in iPhone 17 tops PassMark’s single-thread chart (5,149), edging desktop M3 Ultra, Intel Ultra 9 285K, and AMD EPYC, while sipping ~4 W and using passive cooling. Multi-core trails big chips due to fewer cores, and PassMark’s simple workloads mean caution interpreting results. HN debates phone-to-desktop convergence and a cheap A‑series MacBook, notes Apple’s sustained single-core lead across benchmarks, and argues ARM’s efficiency win doesn’t erase ecosystem and compatibility gaps versus x86.

- Comment pulse
  - Phones should dock into PCs → Apple limits convergence; demand is low and docks mirror laptop costs — counterpoint: a macOS A19 tablet could suffice.
  - PassMark single-thread is simplistic → aggregates FP/sort/compress; rewards bursty IPC, while SIMD-heavy workloads may favor desktop/server parts.
  - ARM ‘beats x86’ narrative → impressive perf/W, but fragmented firmware and software compatibility keep many users on x86.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Great engineering demo; real value depends on sustained performance, developer tooling, and thermal limits in thin devices.
  - Impact: Raises perf/W bar for mobile and entry laptops; pressures Intel/AMD to optimize single-core efficiency, not just core counts.
  - Watch next: Independent SPEC/Web benchmarks, sustained-throttle tests, and any A-series MacBook or standardized Windows-on-ARM PCs with better BIOS/driver stories.
