# The Other Linux Logo

- Score: 89 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45395499) | Link: https://ecogex.com/the-other-linux-logo/

- TL;DR
  - A minimalist, SVG “Other Linux Logo” aims to complement Tux with an icon that remains legible at small sizes, offered under the Free Art License with multiple variants. HN debates whether it reads as a penguin at a glance: eyes look predatory or scared; a seated/side-profile may help. Designers stress scalability and recognizability alongside macOS/Windows marks; some suggest platform emojis. Thread detours into pre-Tux logos (platypus, 1994 red triangle), with caveats about unintended historical symbolism.

- Comment pulse
  - Front-facing eyes feel predatory or scared → side profile or larger eyes may read better; resemblance to Penguin Books noted — counterpoint: bigger eyes seem anxious.
  - Context-free recognizability is weak → without feet or profile it doesn’t scream “penguin”; could work in OS pickers where context is clear; seated variant helps.
  - Need an icon that scales like Apple/Windows → Tux fails at tiny sizes; many SVG variants exist; some advocate using platform penguin emoji instead.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as an iconography complement, not a replacement; test recognition across sizes and backgrounds before adoption.
  - Impact: If adopted, distributions, app stores, documentation, and conference branding gain a consistent small-size mark for Linux.
  - Watch next: Run A/B recognition tests, publish brand guidelines and asset packs, and get inclusion in icon sets and OS-selection UIs.
