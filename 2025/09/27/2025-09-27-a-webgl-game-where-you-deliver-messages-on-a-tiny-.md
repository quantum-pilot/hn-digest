- TL;DR
    - WebGL/WASM tiny‑planet courier game wins praise for art, character design, and smooth mobile performance—even on older phones. Multiplayer uses emoji-only interaction; many welcome no chat for kid‑friendly play, citing Journey/Meadow for richer nonverbal cues. Some players struggled to start deliveries and want better onboarding. iOS camera/movement controls need tuning. Commenters wonder if it’s a solo project; several plan to show it in classes as smart small‑scope design.

- Comment pulse
    - Why mobile performance is strong → tiny-planet curvature limits on-screen models; runs smoothly even on 4‑year‑old Android.
    - Nonverbal communication preferred → emoji menu enables chat-free play, safer for kids — counterpoint: others want richer cues akin to Journey/Meadow.
    - What confuses newcomers → unclear delivery start; click office worker/NPC. iOS camera/movement controls feel finicky; harder to run straight.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Shows WebGL+WASM can deliver stylish, low‑poly 3D multiplayer with excellent mobile perf in a browser.
    - Impact: Encourages solo devs and educators to favor tight scopes, strong art direction, and input-first UX.
    - Watch next: Add onboarding, camera/input options, accessibility; benchmark FPS/battery; experiment with cooperative tasks and richer nonverbal signals.
