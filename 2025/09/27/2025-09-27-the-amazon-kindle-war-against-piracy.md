# The Amazon Kindle War Against Piracy

- Score: 92 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45393505) | Link: https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/the-amazon-kindle-war-against-piracy

- TL;DR
  - Amazon’s latest Kindle firmware (15.18.5) brings device/account‑bound DRM to newer models, removes practical ways to download copies via apps, and increasingly breaks sideloaded files. Amazon also removed USB “Download & Transfer” and made PC/Mac/phone apps reading‑only. Jailbreaks like WinterBreak are being patched. The strategy: deter piracy and reassure publishers, but it further erodes user control and backups. HN reaction: advice to avoid DRM “purchases” and shift to more open reading devices instead.

- Comment pulse
  - DRM push looks hypocritical → industry locks users while scraping content for AI; calls for creator compensation — counterpoint: tougher DRM may secure more titles.
  - Don’t buy what you can’t own → licenses can vanish or break; avoiding DRM avoids a perpetual fight with vendors.
  - Alternatives: iPad mini or open Android e‑ink (e.g., Daylight DC‑1) → flexible apps, no Kindle lock‑in; “Invalid ASIN” bug worries sideloaders.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Kindle is shifting from ownership to access; expect tighter server/device checks over time.
  - Impact: Libraries, DRM‑free sellers, and power users lose interoperability; casual readers feel little pain.
  - Watch next: Backport to 9th/10th gens, sideloading fix timeline, and any regulatory or antitrust scrutiny on platform lock‑in.
