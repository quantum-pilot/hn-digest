# AI Investment Is Starting to Look Like a Slush Fund

- Score: 82 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45393649) | Link: https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-investment-is-starting-to-look-like-a-slush-fund.html

- TL;DR
    - Intelligencer describes a tightening AI money loop: Nvidia’s LOI to invest up to $100B in OpenAI as it buys 10 GW of Nvidia systems, echoing vendor financing. Similar ties with CoreWeave, Oracle, and SoftBank form a circle where investors, vendors, and customers overlap. The piece likens this to late‑90s telecom finance and notes vague, non‑binding terms may soften immediate risk. HN worries focus on systemic fragility, datacenter debt shifting to taxpayers, Nvidia single‑point risk, and potential antitrust around supply‑chain control.

- Comment pulse
    - Circular vendor financing risks cascade failure → valuations depend on each other; one weak Nvidia cycle could topple buyers — counterpoint: DeepSeek scare suggested resilience.
    - AI datacenter debt resembles subprime → a GW can cost $40B with $20B debt; profits uncertain; taxpayers/ratepayers fund power capacity labeled “critical infrastructure”.
    - Cautious strategies by Apple/Amazon look prudent → Microsoft is deeply exposed; Nvidia swapping chips for equity raises vertical control and antitrust questions.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Vendor-financed hyperscaling accelerates capability but obscures product-market fit and sustainable margins, inviting misallocation.
    - Impact: Capital costs, grid access, and Nvidia’s roadmap dominate; startups and academia struggle to compete for compute and capital.
    - Watch next: Binding terms of LOIs, datacenter loan spreads, power procurement commitments, and antitrust inquiries into Nvidia–OpenAI–Microsoft relationships.
