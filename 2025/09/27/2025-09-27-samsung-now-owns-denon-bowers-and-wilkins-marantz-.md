# Samsung now owns Denon, Bowers and Wilkins, Marantz, Polk, and more audio brands

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45395396) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/news/784390/samsung-harman-masimo-audio-acquisition-complete

- TL;DR
  - Samsung’s Harman closed a $350M deal for Sound United, adding Bowers & Wilkins, Denon, Marantz, Polk, HEOS, and more to JBL/Harman Kardon. Sound United stays a standalone unit under Harman’s lifestyle division; Masimo exits to refocus on its Apple Watch legal fight. HN debates what consolidation means as home audio shifts to streaming/home theater: some mourn loss of physical/owned media, others note DIY/pro gear can deliver “hi‑fi” cheaply, while skepticism toward audiophile snake oil and big‑brand gimmicks—Samsung included—runs high.

- Comment pulse
  - Ownership matters as streaming dominates → licensing changes can erase access; subscriptions favor “per action” profits. — counterpoint: local FLAC libraries avoid screens and DRM.
  - High-end sound is accessible DIY → speaker kits, pro amps, and room treatment outperform retail; MiniDSP enables active crossovers in hours.
  - Big-brand audiophile claims face distrust → Denon’s $500 Ethernet cable lingers; Samsung seen as gimmick-heavy, though Denon AVRs and indie brands still earn respect.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Samsung expands vertical leverage across TVs, phones, and smart home; HEOS–SmartThings–JBL integration could deepen lock-in to a single audio ecosystem.
  - Impact: Pressures Sonos, Yamaha, Bluesound; stronger bargaining on codecs and components; potential rationalization of AVR lines across Denon/Marantz vs JBL.
  - Watch next: Unified app/ecosystem, HEOS in Samsung TVs, Dirac/Atmos roadmaps, warranty/service policies, and any pledges to keep Denon/Marantz engineering independent.
