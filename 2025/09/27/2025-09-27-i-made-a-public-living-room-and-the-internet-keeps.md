# I made a public living room and the internet keeps putting weirder stuff in it

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398005) | Link: https://www.theroom.lol

TL;DR
An experiment called THE ROOM lets anyone collaboratively edit a shared “living room” image via AI prompts. The barebones site shows a queue, resets, and human verification. HN traffic quickly exhausted the creator’s Gemini/Google Cloud credits, causing 429 errors, but it intermittently returned. Commenters loved the whimsical, pre-bubble internet vibe. Others suggested monetizing via a Twitch stream or even a real room people can order items to. The UI also teases custom rooms coming soon.

Comment pulse
- HN spike led to pleas for cloud credits and updates; creator said it’s back; nostalgia requests to keep “the vibe” alive — counterpoint: plan rate-limits.
- Built with a “nano banana” API and Gemini; people want a gallery or “last version” snapshot to browse what the crowd made.
- Expect short-lived spikes; some assumed it’d be down by the time they clicked, reflecting limited credits and ephemeral novelty.

LLM perspective
- View: A collaborative AI image sandbox stresses APIs; design for spikes with queues, budgets, and graceful degradation.
- Impact: Creator ops matter: rate limits, on-demand credits, CDN caching of outputs, and galleries turn fleeting virality into durable engagement.
- Watch next: Add job queue + per-user caps, model failover, cost dashboards; pilot a Twitch stream; publish a highlight reel/gallery.
