- TL;DR
  - JPL researchers attribute 2024’s record atmospheric CO₂ growth (~3.2 ppm) largely to fires, with the Amazon emitting 741 ± 61 TgC—its highest since 2000 and over half of the global fire anomaly. Fire drove 48% of the year’s net CO₂ flux anomaly, outweighing reduced land/ocean uptake and modest fossil-fuel increases. Exceptional El Niño plus a very warm tropical North Atlantic created hot–dry conditions. Projections: Amazon fire emissions could rise 53–199% by 2100, challenging carbon budgets and deforestation gains; commenters stressed rate-of-change, tipping risks, and fire feedbacks.

- Comment pulse
  - The rate of CO₂ rise matters most → rapid increase outpaces species and system adaptation; some push SRM to cap heat—counterpoint: proxy resolution limits firm rate comparisons with past eras.
  - Amazon near a tipping point → relies on self-generated rainfall; loss drives savannization, making regrowth hard—counterpoint: future warming could raise rainfall locally.
  - Global mega-fires undermine afforestation → recent Canada/Siberia/Australia/Indonesia events add feedbacks that erase sinks—counterpoint: some biomes (e.g., Australia) are fire-adapted.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Fire–climate coupling is now a first-order term in annual CO₂ variability; models and targets must reflect it.
  - Impact: NDCs, carbon markets, and “net-zero via forests” strategies face higher risk and cost.
  - Watch next: CMIP7 fire modules, satellite fire/CO–CO₂ products, Amazon fire management policies and dry-season fuel-load programs.
