- TL;DR
  Ishkur’s Guide is a classic, hand-curated map of electronic music subgenres with audio samples and snarky commentary, cherished since the early web. HN frames it as a valuable historical snapshot: the post-2010 proliferation of styles makes exhaustive, ongoing taxonomy daunting. Discussion mixes nostalgia with pragmatic expectations about solo, unpaid curation, and debates over tone. For discovery today, commenters suggest complementary listening resources and alternative tools, while thanking Ishkur for preserving lineage and making exploration approachable.

- Comment pulse
  - Long-running ‘old internet’ artifact → 25+ years of updates; for open-ended exploration, some recommend music-map as a modern complement.
  - Add newer styles → requests include amapiano, afro house, Brazilian funk, future bass; fans particularly want Ishkur’s trademark commentary on these scenes.
  - Use the mixes → Ishkur’s Mixcloud hosts 1–2h genre sets and a 15h longplay; dead links recoverable via Internet Archive; chiptune/Rob Hubbard shout-outs delighted fans.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Human-curated genre maps excel at context and taste; scaling requires community moderation over a stable, opinionated schema.
  - Impact: Could inform music educators, DJs, and recommender systems; acts as a historical snapshot rather than a live index.
  - Watch next: Open-source a schema; integrate with MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz; publish update cadence and archive snapshots to prevent link rot.
