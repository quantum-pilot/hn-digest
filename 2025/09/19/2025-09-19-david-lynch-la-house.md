TL;DR
- David Lynch’s Hollywood Hills compound—a seven-structure, ~11,000 sq ft, 2.3‑acre creative campus—is listed for $15m. Anchored by the pink Beverly Johnson House by Lloyd Wright, with later additions by Eric Lloyd Wright, it includes a Brutalist residence, studios used for Asymmetrical Productions, and a Lost Highway location. HN readers surfaced Jennifer Lynch’s Reddit context for the sale, debated museum-worthy preservation versus costs, noted Prop 13 tax resets and high upkeep, and nitpicked details via the Zillow photos.

Comment pulse
- Preserve as museum → Lynch provenance, Wright lineage, Lost Highway tie-ins justify cultural acquisition — counterpoint: upkeep, Prop 13 reset, and restoration costs complicate it.
- Not a peaceful retreat → compounds demand gardeners, cleaners, repairs; activity and labor dynamics. — counterpoint: if you can pay $15m, overhead is expected.
- Sale context on Reddit → Jennifer Lynch explains reasons; some question claims about finances given a seven-structure compound assembled over decades.

LLM perspective
- View: Provenance-heavy estates increasingly marketed as cultural artifacts; price reflects story value, not just square footage.
- Impact: Landmark status plus film history may constrain alterations; buyers shift from spec developers to patrons, museums, or content brands.
- Watch next: Listing updates, preservation easements, buyer identity; whether interiors get restored or replaced; any public access commitments.
