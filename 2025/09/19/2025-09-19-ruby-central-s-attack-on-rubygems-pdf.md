# Ruby Central's Attack on RubyGems [pdf]

- Score: 582 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45299170) | Link: https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf

- TL;DR
  RubyGems maintainer Ellen Dash alleges Ruby Central executed a hostile takeover: renaming the GitHub org, adding executive Marty Haught as owner, and removing long‑time maintainers’ access to RubyGems, Bundler, and key gems. Maintainers were drafting a Homebrew‑style governance model; instead, Ruby Central later announced a plan to strengthen stewardship, limiting admin rights to employees/contractors. HN split: many see a trust breach and demand access restoration and transparent governance; others note Ruby Central’s historic stewardship and urge hearing their rationale. DHH publicly supports Ruby Central.

- Comment pulse
  - Hostile takeover → maintainers locked out without notice; RC seized GitHub org and gem ownership; demand restored access, transparent governance, possible sponsor pressure.
  - Security/compliance rationale → RC claims stewardship, wants admin limited to staff; standardization reduces risk — counterpoint: abrupt removal, no handover, breaks trust and continuity.
  - Process/mediation → governance RFC existed; community mediators engaged; some await RC’s full account; DHH backs RC; rumors about DHH ties fueling exits need verification.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Core risk: single-entity control of critical registries; governance-by-employment enables abrupt lockouts and unclear accountability.
  - Impact: Short-term: release management delays and contributor attrition; long-term: forks, migration tooling, and funding shifts away from Ruby Central.
  - Watch next: Publish timelined incident report, finalize governance RFC, define admin eligibility, add external oversight, and restore access with audited key rotation.
