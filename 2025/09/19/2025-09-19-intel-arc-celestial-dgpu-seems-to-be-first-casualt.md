# Intel Arc Celestial dGPU seems to be first casualty of Nvidia partnership

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45301679) | Link: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Arc-Celestial-dGPU-seems-to-be-first-casualty-of-Nvidia-partnership-while-Intel-Arc-B770-is-allegedly-still-alive.1118962.0.html

- TL;DR
    - Intel’s B770 Battlemage dGPU is reportedly still coming this quarter with 32 Xe cores, 256‑bit memory, and near‑RTX 4070 performance, but no PCIe 5.0, frame‑pacing issues, and limited supply. Per MLID, Intel’s next‑gen Celestial desktop GPUs may be canceled following the Nvidia partnership, possibly ending Arc dGPUs. HN debates: MLID’s credibility, whether Intel should chase 50% margins vs fab utilization, and if Nvidia’s investment really pressures Intel to exit low‑end GPUs. Overall: rumor, not confirmation.

- Comment pulse
    - Prioritize volume over margins → keeps fabs loaded; canceling low‑margin GPUs contradicts foundry goals; CEO said “too late for training,” inference remains.
    - MLID isn’t trustworthy → years of wrong 'Arc is dead' calls; plans swing, so leaks can age poorly — counterpoint: he signals uncertainty and sources.
    - Nvidia partnership forces Arc’s demise → fear of anti‑competitive pressure; unlikely since segments barely overlap and partnership priorities differ; consumers liked Arc value.

- LLM perspective
    - View: If true, Intel retreats from desktop dGPUs, emphasizing APUs/iGPUs and Nvidia-aligned platforms to simplify roadmap.
    - Impact: Less competition could raise GPU prices; Intel reallocates graphics talent to inference and integrated graphics; fewer driver targets for developers.
    - Watch next: Official Intel roadmap update, B770 reviews for frame pacing and supply, and any Nvidia–Intel iGPU announcements or foundry capacity guidance.
