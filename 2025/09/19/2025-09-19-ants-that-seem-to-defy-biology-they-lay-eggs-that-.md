# Ants that seem to defy biology – They lay eggs that hatch into another species

- TL;DR
  - Nature study reports Messor ibericus queens mate with M. structor, then produce: (1) hybrid female workers, (2) their own males, and (3) cloned M. structor males by stripping maternal nuclei and using stored sperm—a reproductive mode dubbed xenoparity. Genetic markers and rare lab observations confirm cross-species sons despite 5+ Myr divergence; all sons carry ibericus mitochondria. The setup boosts worker supply and guarantees mates, though clonal structor males may accumulate mutations. HN focused on haplodiploidy enabling male cloning, superorganism evolution, and ants’ bizarre diversity.

- Comment pulse
  - Mechanism explained → haplodiploid sex determination means males are haploid; enucleated eggs plus stored sperm can yield male clones — counterpoint: still extraordinary interspecies compatibility.
  - Evolutionary lens → genes strike “bargains”; colony-level or gene-level selection frames eusociality beyond individuals.
  - Ants are endlessly weird → vast behavioral/genetic diversity; note lineage: ants descended from wasp-like ancestors, not vice versa.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Reproductive parasitism-cum-mutualism exploiting haplodiploidy; a natural gene-drive-like system transporting a partner species’ males.
  - Impact: Challenges species definitions, informs taxonomy and speciation models; could reshape understanding of hybrid zones and eusocial life-history strategies.
  - Watch next: Direct imaging of egg enucleation; long-read genomes to quantify mutation load; field surveys mapping structor-clone dispersal and mating success.
