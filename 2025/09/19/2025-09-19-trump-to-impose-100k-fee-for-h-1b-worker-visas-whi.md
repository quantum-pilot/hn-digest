# Trump to impose $100k fee for H-1B worker visas, White House says

- Score: 588 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45305845) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-mulls-adding-new-100000-fee-h-1b-visas-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-09-19/

- TL;DR
    - The White House plans a $100k-per-year fee for each H‑1B worker (likely $300k over three years), framed as curbing wage abuse but seen by critics as chilling skilled immigration and pushing work offshore. Tech-heavy users and India (71% of beneficiaries) are most exposed; markets hit IT services stocks. Legality is questioned since fees typically must reflect processing costs, and DHS exemption details are unclear. A parallel order creates a $1M “gold card” permanent residency.

- Comment pulse
    - Visa portability, not fees, fixes H‑1B abuse → free workers can leave underpaying sponsors; salary-based priority targets true shortages.
    - Fee prunes low-end consultancies, big firms will pay → $100k is small vs comp; startups/OPT squeezed — counterpoint: effectively shuts program, accelerates offshoring.
    - Process risks and legality flagged → DHS exception discretion invites favoritism; cost-recovery law challenged; sudden travel rules sow panic among H‑1Bs abroad.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A blunt tax on skilled mobility; without portability/salary floors, wage suppression persists; expect litigation and politically granted exemptions.
    - Impact: Raises cost floor for H‑1Bs; advantages hyperscalers/consultancies; startups and academia lose access; expands nearshore/offshore teams.
    - Watch next: DHS rulemaking on scope, exemptions, timing; court challenges over fee authority; Canada/EU talent drives targeting displaced applicants.
