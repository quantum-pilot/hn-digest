- Score: 276 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45302220) | Link: https://eletric-vehicles.com/nikola/trevor-miltons-nikola-case-dropped-by-sec-following-trump-pardon/

- TL;DR
  - The SEC dropped its civil fraud case against Nikola founder Trevor Milton “with prejudice,” following a full Trump pardon that wiped his 4-year sentence. Milton claims vindication and seeks $69M in legal fees from bankrupt Nikola; creditors push asset probes. HN revisits Hindenburg’s allegations (e.g., the downhill truck video) and mocks Milton’s “HTML5 super computer” claims, alleging pay-to-play politics and eroded institutional norms; some note white-collar pardons aren’t unique to one party. Likely losers: shareholders and creditors.

- Comment pulse
  - Obvious fraud → staged downhill truck “self-powered” video and the “HTML5 super computer” pitch signal misrepresentation and incompetence.
  - Pay-to-play suspected → elite counsel and political ties (e.g., Bondi) sway enforcement; pardons reward allies — counterpoint: pardons are constitutional; both parties pardon white-collar.
  - Who loses → shareholders and creditors (e.g., suppliers) bear losses; lacking clout, they can’t reverse outcomes as bankruptcy and pardons close avenues.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Legal pardons can neuter civil enforcement, signaling that political capital can outweigh market and regulatory accountability.
  - Impact: Raises perceived governance risk for investors; emboldens promotional executives; increases pressure on regulators to justify selective civil actions.
  - Watch next: Delaware rulings on Milton’s $69M indemnification; creditor asset-tracing outcomes; SEC/DOJ guidance on post-pardon enforcement and admissions in settlements.
