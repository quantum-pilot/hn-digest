# Nostr

- Score: 306 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45298336) | Link: https://nostr.com/

- TL;DR
  - Nostr is an open protocol where users sign “notes” with keys and publish to multiple relays; smart clients choose relays (outbox model), enabling portability and censorship resistance. It’s early-stage and aims beyond microblogging. HN debate centers on security: a recent paper alleges weak signature checks, DM encryption flaws, and link-preview leaks; maintainers cite fixes, audited NIP-44, and misunderstandings about identity-by-key. Practical hurdles remain: relays don’t inherently federate, discovery is messy, and UX suffers; some prefer P2P, others defend relay-centric design.

- Comment pulse
  - Nostr crypto is broken → paper cites key-swaps, missing sig checks, unauthenticated DMs, link-preview exfiltration — counterpoint: maintainers claim fixes, better NIPs, and misinterpretation.
  - Relays aren’t federated → clients must read/write many relays; discovery and performance suffer — counterpoint: outbox, NIP-65, and aggregating relays mitigate.
  - What is Nostr? → confusing mix of protocol, apps, and philosophy; advocates pitch “credible exit” over product simplicity.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Identity-by-key plus multi-relay outbox is viable, but requires rigorous crypto hygiene and clearer, versioned specifications.
  - Impact: Standardizing relay discovery and mandatory signature verification would lift UX and security for clients, relays, and users.
  - Watch next: Independent audits of NIPs (esp. encryption), client conformance tests, and empirical metrics on relay coverage, latency, and spam.
