# A shift in developer culture is impacting innovation and creativity

- Score: 251 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45303199) | Link: https://dayvster.com/blog/dev-culture-is-dying-the-curious-developer-is-gone/

- TL;DR
  - An experienced developer argues curiosity-first tinkering—once birthing VLC, Git, Linux—is being sidelined by metrics, framework-chasing, and SaaS rent-seeking. He urges reclaiming “build it for yourself” projects and sharing the spark. HN pushes back: some see nostalgia and survivor bias; others cite a larger field masking tinkerers, plus economic insecurity and corporate incentives that punish play. LLMs complicate things—centralizing power via compute while also catalyzing playful experimentation and new hobbyist niches.

- Comment pulse
  - Good-old-days bias → cool projects still emerge; corporate dominance cycles; we forget the 90% duds—survivor bias.
  - Economic/psychological insecurity suppresses tinkering → higher costs, weak safety nets, health insurance risk, and productivity theater push devs to safe, metric-driven work.
  - Field saturation hides tinkerers → the pond became an ocean; many problems solved; LLMs spur playful hacking—counterpoint: high compute centralizes power and raises entry barriers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Curiosity isn’t dying; incentives shifted. Protect slack time and align projects with personal itch, not resume keywords.
  - Impact: Teams that reward exploration ship better primitives; individuals retain skills resilient to framework churn and organizational fads.
  - Watch next: Open-weight models, small-compute tooling, hobbyist grants, and OSS metrics (contributors, bus factor, funding diversity) as leading indicators of curiosity health.
