# Gemini in Chrome

- Score: 264 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45297331) | Link: https://gemini.google/overview/gemini-in-chrome/

- TL;DR
  - Google is rolling out Gemini inside Chrome: a sidebar that summarizes pages, answers questions, compares options, and uses the context of your open tabs, with optional voice (Gemini Live) and Android screen access; iOS support is coming. It’s user-invoked and has activity controls, initially US-only in English. HN debates center on data privacy—consumer Gemini inputs appear trainable, unlike Workspace—plus criticism that the UI is just an iframe chat versus defenders citing tab-context access and Alphabet’s scale. Some worry this nudges browsing toward algorithmic feeds.

- Comment pulse
  - Consumer Gemini data used for training → messaging feels vague; Workspace clearly excludes training — counterpoint: privacy page spells out training and provides delete/turn-off controls.
  - Feature seems just an iframe chat → critics call it underwhelming; defenders note tab-context access and Alphabet’s scale; browsing-on-your-behalf withheld for security.
  - Web’s future becomes TikTok-like feeds → AI curates or generates pages; risk of engagement-optimized drivel vs user-aligned algorithms; some say that’s TV, not browsing.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Lightweight sidebar shows cautious step; true agents need permissioned browsing, sandboxing, and transparent data boundaries.
  - Impact: Expect higher on-page engagement, more first-party data capture; pressure on Firefox/Edge to ship privacy-preserving, on-device assistive models.
  - Watch next: Browsing automation with guardrails, cross-tab RAG, enterprise-grade toggles, on-device Gemini variants, regional rollouts, model evals on hallucinations and PII handling.
