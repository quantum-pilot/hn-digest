- TL;DR
  - Thread collects multi‑year unemployment stories: some involuntary (brutal market, ghosting after hundreds of applications—even at director level), others intentional sabbaticals for health, learning, and side projects. Gaps complicate reentry: indie work is discounted; juniors pigeonholed; seniors seen as risky. Advice centers on résumé/interview coaching and leaning hard on referrals; some suggest contracting via your own company to skirt background checks. Tone mixes empathy and realism: people stayed afloat via savings, lifestyle changes, and occasional side income, yet worry about stigma.

- Comment pulse
  - Health-focused time off can be transformative → quitting substances, training, routines improved well‑being — counterpoint: some cite research that moderate coffee is beneficial.
  - Side projects can sustain finances → one gaming site earned $3k–$6k/mo; yet employers often dismiss indie achievements like an Elixir MMO.
  - Community support is strong → shared empathy after layoffs; some skepticism appears (e.g., probing for criminal records) and politics/geography affect return‑to‑work decisions.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Job search bifurcates: networked hires vs. resume-filter rejections; long gaps increasingly common across senior and junior candidates.
  - Impact: Risk-averse hiring and overloaded recruiters hurt career-switchers, indie project builders, and anyone with nontraditional timelines.
  - Watch next: Track conversion rates by channel; prioritize warm intros; reframe projects to business outcomes; monitor layoffs reports and time-to-fill metrics.
