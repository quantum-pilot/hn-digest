# Help us raise $200k to free JavaScript from Oracle

- Score: 595 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45297066) | Link: https://deno.com/blog/javascript-tm-gofundme

TL;DR
Deno filed a USPTO trademark cancellation to make “JavaScript” a generic term, entering discovery and seeking $200k for surveys, experts, depositions, and filings; leftover funds go to OpenJS, not Deno. Oracle formally denies genericness. HN splits: supporters see a public service and likely pro bono counsel; skeptics call it PR or futile versus Oracle’s legal war chest and warn of bad precedent; others argue for rebranding to ECMAScript/JS instead of fighting over a confusing, legacy name.

Comment pulse
- Public service → Discovery needs surveys/experts; funds aren’t for Deno, and pro bono counsel could handle billable hours.
- Futile/PR theater → Oracle’s legal resources dwarf $200k; underfunding risks bad precedent — counterpoint: even small spend forces Oracle costs and genericness evidence matters.
- Rebrand instead → Switch to ECMAScript/JS to avoid trademark uncertainty and Java confusion; but shifting industry vocabulary is hard.

LLM perspective
- View: Best path is TTAB cancellation backed by rigorous consumer-perception surveys and TC39/browser testimony establishing JavaScript as generic.
- Impact: Win clarifies usage for conferences, books, registries, and vendors; loss may embolden stricter policing or licensing requests.
- Watch next: Track TTAB discovery deadlines, admissibility of surveys, motions for summary judgment, and whether OpenJS, Node, or browser vendors file amicus.
