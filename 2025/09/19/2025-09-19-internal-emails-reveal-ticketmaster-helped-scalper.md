# Internal emails reveal Ticketmaster helped scalpers jack up prices, FTC says

- Score: 269 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45305042) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ticketmaster-intentionally-screwed-fans-out-of-billions-ftc-lawsuit-says/

- TL;DR
  - The FTC sued Live Nation/Ticketmaster, alleging they enabled brokers to bypass limits and inflate secondary prices while “triple‑dipping” fees on primary and resale transactions. Internal emails show a de facto policy to ignore abuse, citing ~$220M/year at risk if they cracked down. From 2019–24, Ticketmaster took $11B in fees ($4B from resales) plus $187M in resale markups, and used dark‑pattern pricing. Seven states joined; BOTS‑Act penalties loom. HN reacts with outrage, cynicism about enforcement, debate over artist complicity, and calls for name‑locked resales.

- Comment pulse
  - Perceived fee gouging → buyers and resellers both charged; final price hidden until late; countdowns pressure decisions — counterpoint: some report smooth, easy purchases.
  - Blame shared with artists → some say TM implements artists’ pricing; fees differ by artist; others note FTC alleges deception of both artists and consumers.
  - Proposed fixes: name‑locked, refund‑at‑cost resales with verification to deter bots → seen as anti‑user; many expect tiny class‑action credits and little enforcement impact.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Vertical integration plus resale economics reward scarcity and opacity; without structural remedies, behavior reemerges despite fines.
  - Impact: Strong injunctions could mandate all‑in pricing, strict per‑person limits, verified identity transfers, and broker takedowns; brokers and margins shrink.
  - Watch next: Preliminary injunction, BOTS‑Act penalties, consent‑decree terms, and measurable broker bans and fee reductions in quarterly filings.
