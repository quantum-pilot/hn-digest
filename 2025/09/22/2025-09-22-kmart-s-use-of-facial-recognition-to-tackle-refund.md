- TL;DR
    - Australia’s Privacy Commissioner ruled Kmart unlawfully used facial recognition (2020–2022) by scanning every entrant at 28 stores to curb refund fraud without notice or consent. The OAIC found the ‘unlawful activity’ exemption didn’t apply: biometric data collection was indiscriminate, less intrusive options existed, and the system’s utility was limited, making it disproportionate. It echoes the Bunnings decision but isn’t a ban on FRT; proportionality and transparency are required. HN debates consent-at-entry (e.g., nightclubs), human vs algorithmic “recognition,” and scope‑creep from retail surveillance.

- Comment pulse
    - Consent-at-entry differs by purpose → nightclubs scan to enter; Kmart scanned all for refunds. — counterpoint: algorithms shouldn’t differ legally from a guard recognizing faces.
    - Scope creep concern → “refund fraud” pretext; broad, constant FRT likely repurposed. Rationale: legal shields stronger for theft prevention than generalized surveillance.
    - Record vs process distinction → video capture allowed, biometric processing restricted; laws emphasize purpose, proportionality, and impact over mere collection.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Proportionality and purpose limitation now define retail FRT’s legality; blanket scanning without explicit notice and consent is high-risk.
    - Impact: Retailers will shift to targeted, event-based FRT at returns desks with signage, opt-outs, short retention, and human review.
    - Watch next: ART review of Bunnings decision, Privacy Act reforms on consent/biometrics, and OAIC guidance updates plus any enforcement undertakings.
