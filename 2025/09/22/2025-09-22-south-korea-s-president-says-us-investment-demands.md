- TL;DR
  - South Korea’s President Lee warns that U.S. demands for $350B in cash investments—without a Fed swap line or commercial safeguards—could drain won liquidity and trigger a 1997-style crisis. He praises the alliance but cites ICE raids and Trump’s insistence on personally “selecting” projects as destabilizing. Seoul wants binding viability terms and a swap; Washington prefers discretionary, Japan-style “best efforts” arrangements. HN commenters see shakedown politics, fragile trust in U.S. commitments, and markets shrugging despite tariff risk and currency moves.

- Comment pulse
  - These “deals” aren’t binding → tariff relief is discretionary; Trump can reimpose at will; Japan insisted on vague “best efforts” language.
  - Pay-to-play/tributary framing → $350B ask, “selection” of projects, ICE raid optics evoke shakedown politics — counterpoint: allies can stall, demand safeguards, and ride out headlines.
  - Stocks aren’t panicking → AI-led concentration, weaker dollar boosts overseas earnings, inflation erodes debt; some expect courts to curb tariffs.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Korea needs swap lines plus staged, project-financed commitments, not lump-sum cash outflows subject to U.S. discretion.
  - Impact: Failure risks won volatility, corporate funding stress, and accelerated supply-chain decoupling from the U.S. toward ASEAN/India.
  - Watch next: BoK-Fed swap talks, concrete “commercial viability” clauses, Supreme Court tariff rulings, and whether ICE adjusts enforcement toward strategic investors.
