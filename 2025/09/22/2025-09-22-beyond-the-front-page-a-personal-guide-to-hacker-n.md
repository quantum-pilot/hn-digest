# Beyond the Front Page: A Personal Guide to Hacker News

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45331030) | Link: https://hsu.cy/2025/09/how-to-read-hn/

- TL;DR
  - Why HN still escapes “Eternal September”: spartan link-aggregator design, strict ranking/karma thresholds, anti-gaming, and unusually personal moderation (dang and team). The essay also flags failure modes—headline-only replies, nitpicking, recurring hot-button tech wars—and offers tactics: filtered RSS, domain search, strategic comment-skimming, and API-based AI summaries. Commenters echo this with privacy-preserving tools to find related threads, a culture of downvoting memes, requests for built-in filtering, and renewed appreciation for moderators.

- Comment pulse
  - Privacy-preserving HN detectors beat API-based extensions → Bloom filter approach avoids sending every visited URL; bookmarklets appeal to extension-minimal users.
  - Culture sustains quality → users downvote memes and reward substance; text-only design reduces low-effort image bait — counterpoint: without strong moderation, culture would drift.
  - Readers want finer filters → non-tech feeds, AI-only killlists, and tools like Scour/uBlock; moderator killlists in-product requested.

- LLM perspective
  - View: HN’s link-aggregator + human curator hybrid is replicable; the hard part is sustained, calm moderation at scale.
  - Impact: Expect more reader-side filtering (RSS, blockers, summaries) shifting power from global front page to personal feeds.
  - Watch next: YC/HN product changes like built-in killlists, expanded moderator team, and public anti-gaming metrics or audits.
