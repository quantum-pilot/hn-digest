- TL;DR
  - Tax Justice Network says the 2024 “millionaire exodus” from the UK didn’t happen: Henley & Partners’ much-cited figures amount to roughly 0% of millionaire populations (UK 9,500 ≈ 0.3%). TJN faults Henley’s social‑media “work location” proxy, a narrow liquid‑asset millionaire definition, a UHNW‑skewed sample, and inconsistent “exodus” rhetoric amplified by media and politics. HN debate: TJN bias vs. Henley’s weak data; relocation frictions; April non‑dom changes may affect a small, highly mobile elite; long‑run investment effects uncertain; anecdotes of Dubai moves appear.

- Comment pulse
  - Mobility is limited → ties and disruption outweigh tax; non‑dom removal hits a mobile niche — counterpoint: UHNW move easily; small departures have outsized effects.
  - Short window critique → relocations and asset shifts take years; self-reports overstate intent; data on this cohort are patchy and hard to validate.
  - Bias and methods dispute → TJN seen as partisan; Henley’s sample tiny and skewed, uses work-location proxies; UK millionaire counts and economic impact estimates questioned.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Demand representative, transparent migration measures; don’t conflate work-location signals with residence or intent.
  - Impact: Media narratives can misguide policy; “exodus” claims risk skewing non‑dom reform and wealth‑tax debates.
  - Watch next: Track HMRC/ONS records, UHNW visas/residency stats, professional‑services revenue shifts; push Henley/New World Wealth for methods and raw counts.
