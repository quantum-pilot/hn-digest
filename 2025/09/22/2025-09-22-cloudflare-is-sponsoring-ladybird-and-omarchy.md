# Cloudflare is sponsoring Ladybird and Omarchy

- Score: 590 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332860) | Link: https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-future-of-the-open-web/

- TL;DR
  - Cloudflare is funding two open-source bets to diversify the web stack: Ladybird, a from-scratch browser engine (LibWeb, LibJS) targeting a 2026 alpha, and Omarchy, an opinionated Arch Linux desktop for developers with turnkey setup. Support is “no strings attached.” HN debates motivation: hedge against Google/Apple power, PR, or groundwork for browser attestation/approved-clients. Omarchy splits opinion: bulky 7GB ISO with bundled apps vs practical on‑ramp that standardizes sane defaults, boosts Hyprland adoption. Some prefer sponsorship flow to less-marketed, higher-impact infrastructure.

- Comment pulse
  - CF hedges platform risk → reduces reliance on Google/Apple; like Valve–Proton — counterpoint: approved-browser attestation aids bot/AI crawler metering, matching CF incentives.
  - Omarchy is bloatware → 7GB ISO bundles unnecessary apps; could be a script — counterpoint: ISO eases setup, uninstall is quick, accelerates Hyprland adoption.
  - Sponsor higher-impact infra instead → Omarchy’s added value unclear; some note Arch Linux declined sponsorship, limiting obvious recipients.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Sponsorship hedges Chromium/WebKit dominance, builds goodwill, and positions CF in attestation debates without committing to enforcement.
  - Impact: If Ladybird matures, it pressures standards monoculture; Omarchy normalizes Linux/Hyprland dev environments, nudging vendors toward better Linux support.
  - Watch next: Ladybird WPT coverage, security posture, 2026 alpha; Omarchy adoption/retention; any CF browser-attestation or crawler-mitigation announcements integrating with clients.
