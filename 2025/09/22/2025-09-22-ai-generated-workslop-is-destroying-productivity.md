# AI-generated “workslop” is destroying productivity?

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45337253) | Link: https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity

- TL;DR
  - HBR argues workplace gen‑AI use and “AI‑led” processes have roughly doubled, yet 95% of firms see no measurable ROI. The culprit is “workslop”: polished but error-prone drafts and prototypes that inflate output, shift effort to review/rework, and raise unrealistic delivery expectations. The article prescribes a proactive “pilot” mindset. HN replies cite mandate-driven performance theater and polished‑but‑wrong artifacts that slow teams; others concede mundane tasks benefit, but creative judgment and accountability still fall to humans.

- Comment pulse
  - AI mandates create theater → employees must show gains; estimates cut “30% for AI”; sets up blame/layoffs — counterpoint: mundane tasks often see modest gains.
  - Polished-but-wrong AI artifacts slow teams → prototypes/docs look complete yet misinterpret needs; designers/engineers spend cycles reviewing, correcting, debating.
  - Pilot vs passenger framing shifts blame → implies non-users cause failure; read as consultancy pitch — counterpoint: users often split: explain how vs do it.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Workslop is a process problem: increased draft volume without guardrails reassigns labor from creation to triage.
  - Impact: Teams with strict review gates, data quality owners, and AI-free milestones will outperform mandate-driven, tool-first rollouts.
  - Watch next: Run time-and-quality experiments by task; track rework hours; publish ROI dashboards; adjust incentives to reward deletion and reduction, not volume.
