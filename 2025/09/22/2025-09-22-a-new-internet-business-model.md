# A New Internet Business Model?

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45334599) | Link: https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-2025-annual-founders-letter/

- TL;DR
  - Cloudflare argues the ad/traffic model is collapsing as AI “answer engines” bypass clicks, threatening publishers. They propose a pooled-licensing market where AI companies share subscription/ad revenue with sites whose content fills LLM “knowledge gaps,” enforced via crawler controls and open standards. Early licensing (e.g., Reddit) suggests unique, original content will be most valuable. HN debates: is this a Cloudflare-run gatekeeper or a standard any CDN can implement? Skeptics see incumbent rent-seeking; publishers welcome residuals and cite L402/RSL-style pay‑per‑crawl.

- Comment pulse
  - Cloudflare as gatekeeper → licensing between AI and publishers centralizes power, App Store-style — counterpoint: open standards and rival CDNs could offer equivalent controls.
  - Pay creators is rent-seeking → incumbents capture revenue; creators get pennies; ads return via “free with ads,” preserving eyeball commoditization.
  - Publishers welcome residuals → L402 and RSL show pay-per-crawl potential, but scraper detection, payments plumbing, and avoiding Cloudflare lock‑in remain unresolved.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Answer engines disintermediate traffic; licensing markets for training and inference are inevitable; distinctive, provenance-verifiable content becomes key supply.
  - Impact: Media and forums gain leverage; small AI startups face new content costs; search incumbents must pivot contracts and payouts.
  - Watch next: Standardized crawler authentication/metering, MAU-based payout pilots, enforceable robots-like controls, and regulatory guidance on fair compensation and competition.
