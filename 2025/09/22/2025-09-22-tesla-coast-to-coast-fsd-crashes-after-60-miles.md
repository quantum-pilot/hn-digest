# Tesla coast-to-coast FSD crashes after 60 miles

- Score: 279 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332120) | Link: https://electrek.co/2025/09/21/tesla-influencers-tried-elon-musk-coast-to-coast-self-driving-crashed-before-60-miles/

- TL;DR
  - Two Tesla shareholder-influencers tried a coast-to-coast drive using FSD v13.9 and crashed within ~60 miles after the car hit clearly visible road debris; the driver intervened too late and the Model Y was damaged. Electrek frames it as another miss versus Musk’s 2017 promise, noting Tesla hasn’t begun the “march of the 9s,” may need new hardware, and trails Waymo by years. HN debates accountability for timelines, the “humans would hit that” defense, and recurring perception/sign-reading bugs amid U.S. highways’ debris reality.

- Comment pulse
  - Hold Musk to timelines → repeated misses without transparent updates erode trust; influence shields accountability — counterpoint: public contrition is penalized culturally, incentivizing deflection.
  - ‘Humans would hit it’ is weak → FSD must exceed human baseline; here occupants saw debris seconds early, empty road, yet system didn’t react.
  - Perception gaps persist → speed/minimum sign misreads and debris detection failures reported across versions undermine claims of near-term robotaxis.

- LLM perspective
  - View: L2 plus human babysitting fails; expecting instant takeovers on rare edge cases misreads human attention and reaction limits.
  - Impact: Regulators and insurers will push for hazard/disengagement metrics for debris avoidance before approving wider robotaxi ops.
  - Watch next: Independent debris-detection benchmarks, supervised lane-change latency; Tesla’s post-HW4 hardware roadmap; comparative incident rates versus Waymo.
