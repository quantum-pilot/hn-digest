# Easy Forth (2015)

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332130) | Link: https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/

- TL;DR
    - An in-browser mini-ebook teaches Forth by doing: stack-based RPN, defining words, core stack ops, output, booleans, conditionals, do/loop and begin/until, and memory via variables/constants/allot. Examples build from arithmetic to FizzBuzz and a Snake game using a memory-mapped canvas plus non-standard helpers (random, sleep, last-key). The goal is mental models, not production Forth; it ends with pointers like Starting Forth. HN adds resources (Jones Forth, Wagner video, FXYT), critiques utility, and flags auto-scrolling/UI issues.

- Comment pulse
    - Jones Forth is a top recommendation → literate, from-scratch implementation that teaches dictionary, threading, and primitives—even for non-assembly readers.
    - FXYT, a tiny Forth/Tixy-like canvas language → playful examples; users ask for built‑in presets and how to draw circles; Forth Haiku mentioned.
    - Skeptics: ‘no one builds useful software in Forth’ → recurring debate; UX gripe: page auto‑scrolling breaks Safari/Firefox — counterpoint: disabling JS helps.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Stack concatenative practice sharpens understanding of stacks, interpreters, and factoring; great for thinking, not frameworks.
    - Impact: Helps embedded, retro, firmware, and DSL designers; educators gain a browser REPL to teach state, memory, and control flow.
    - Watch next: Add mobile-friendly UI, presets, and tests; compare with gforth/JonesForth; benchmark interpreter; document non-standard words; publish more project exercises.
