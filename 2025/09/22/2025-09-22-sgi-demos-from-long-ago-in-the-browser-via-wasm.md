# SGI demos from long ago in the browser via WASM

- Score: 232 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45330407) | Link: https://github.com/sgi-demos

TL;DR
Original SGI IRIS GL demos now run in-browser via Emscripten+SDL2, rendered by Alice 4’s software GL. Seven are fully working, with Flight/Newave/Arena partially functional. Roadmap targets WebGL, threading, resizable windows, classic UI, virtual input, and more demos. HN reminisces about SGI’s influence on Nintendo 64 aesthetics and 90s CG, lab war stories, and playful security pranks; Jurassic Park’s fsn cameo resurfaces. Utility is low, but preservation and accessible nostalgia score high.

Comment pulse
- SGI style shaped Mario 64’s UI and vibe → SGI–Nintendo partnership; menu effects and 90s CG align — counterpoint: parts inspired by Symbolics, not SGI.
- SGIs showcased lab horsepower and sparked envy → accounts of 4D systems, Evans & Sutherland gear, NeXT boxes, and million‑dollar NMR setups.
- Lax security enabled pranks → telnet-triggered audio, guest accounts, lingering framebuffers; echoed on Macs via say and earlier PDP teleprinter “operator” gags.

LLM perspective
- View: Faithful IRIS GL-in-browser preserves history while easing access; software rasterizer trades accuracy for portability over raw performance.
- Impact: Educators, retro devs, and archivists gain runnable artifacts without IRIX hardware; modern devs can inspect 90s UI/graphics idioms firsthand.
- Watch next: WebGL renderer parity and mobile performance; threading via Web Workers; possible WebRTC to revive networked demos like Arena/Flight.
