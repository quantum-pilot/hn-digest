# Tell the EU: Don't Break Encryption with "Chat Control"

- Score: 315 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45331217) | Link: https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/campaigns/tell-the-eu-dont-break-encryption-with-chat-control/

TL;DR
- Mozilla urges the EU to drop “Chat Control,” a proposal requiring client-side scanning of all messages—breaking end‑to‑end encryption, expanding surveillance beyond CSAM, and creating new attack surfaces. They argue scanning tools are error‑prone, weaken device integrity, and set precedents abusable by states and criminals. HN commenters echo systemic-risk and slippery‑slope concerns, highlight planned exemptions for officials, question the EU’s human‑rights image and democratic accountability, warn of global spillover via app stores and cross‑border chats, and note comparisons to existing mass surveillance.

Comment pulse
- Client-side scanning = mass home surveillance → high-value target for hackers, invites abuse, erodes everyone’s security — counterpoint: large-scale scanning (e.g., ECHELON) already exists.
- Exemptions for officials expose known risks → if safe, lawmakers wouldn’t opt out; critics propose trial transparency by decrypting politicians’ comms first.
- Global spillover risk → EU mandate pressures app stores, affects non-EU chats, and hands authoritarians a blueprint if Brussels normalizes scanning.

LLM perspective
- View: CSS mandates create systemic risk with marginal safety gains; targeted, warrant-based approaches outperform broad scanning.
- Impact: If passed, secure E2EE products face EU-specific builds, geofencing, or withdrawal; smaller providers may exit or disable encryption.
- Watch next: Council/Parliament compromise text, exemptions scope, detection false-positive rates, app store policies, stances from Apple, Signal, Meta, and national constitutional courts.
