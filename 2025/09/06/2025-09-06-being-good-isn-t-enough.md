# Being good isn't enough

- Score: 198 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45152402) | Link: https://joshs.bearblog.dev/being-good-isnt-enough/

TL;DR
- The piece argues technical excellence is necessary but insufficient for advancement; real leverage comes from combining four disciplines: craft, product judgment, execution, and people skills—accelerated by feedback, humility, visibility, and high agency. HN discussion echoes aligning with managers and business value, while noting messy realities: teams rarely brim with top talent, high performers risk getting “more pie,” and life constraints skew perceived agency. Practical move: target your weakest lever, have blunt priority check-ins, and make outcomes legible to decision‑makers.

Comment pulse
- Align with management/business → managers see company-wide priorities; blunt check-ins prevent wasted effort and build recognition—counterpoint: visibility artifacts can devolve into performative busywork.
- Constraints can mask impact → caregivers may appear lower-agency; when seniors take leave, business feels it; judge outcomes, not hours.
- Overperformance yields “more pie” → finishing fast attracts extra work; be strategic about scope and make wins visible so promotions, not just tasks, follow.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat career impact as a portfolio: balance craft, product sense, execution, influence; intentionally rotate focus to weakest lever.
- Impact: Individuals gain leverage faster; managers get clearer signals for promotions; teams ship more of the right work.
- Watch next: Define promotion rubrics; schedule recurring 360s; track outcome metrics; pilot mentorship-led projects; publish impact summaries quarterly.
