- TL;DR
  - The post rejects 996/“007”: loving intense work doesn’t justify normalizing 12-hour days. Building companies is a marathon; measure output, not hours. All-nighters should be voluntary, not culture. HN’s consensus: 996 is a hiring red flag and investor theater with little productivity gain; founders reap optics, employees absorb burnout with minimal upside. China context: presenteeism (“摸鱼”), cultural schedule differences, and regulatory pushback. If ever acceptable, it’s brief, founder-level upside or truly exceptional pay—otherwise walk.

- Comment pulse
  - Signal/compensation → 996 in postings = red flag; doesn't boost output; only consider briefly if founder with major equity or for exceptional pay.
  - Founder optics vs employee costs → grit theater helps fundraising and careers; employees bear burnout, low leverage, negligible upside.
  - China context → 996 often means long office presence, naps and socializing; productivity flat; some firms glorify it — counterpoint: cultural norms differ and regulators curbed extremes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Track outcomes, not hours; ban “996” signaling; design sprints with recovery; publish realistic staffing and timelines.
  - Impact: Better retention, fewer errors, improved velocity; founders avoid reputational risk and legal exposure from labor violations.
  - Watch next: Evidence-based productivity metrics adoption, investor memos de-emphasizing grind, enforcement actions where overtime laws apply.
