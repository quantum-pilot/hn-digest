# A Navajo weaving of an integrated circuit: the 555 timer

- TL;DR
    - Marilou Schultz, a Diné weaver, translated the 555 timer’s die into a Navajo rug: white paths for metal interconnects, orange diamonds for bond pads, three dominant transistors. Inspired by Antoine Bercovici’s dark-field micrograph, the piece includes artistic simplifications and metallic threads; an interactive browser maps rug regions to actual chip functions. The post also recaps how the 555 times via RC charging between 1/3–2/3 thresholds and notes Navajo–semiconductor history. HN highlights textile–computing echoes (core memory, Jacquard) and preservation humor.

- Comment pulse
    - Textile–computing have long intertwined → Navajo memory cores for Apollo 1969 and recent installations show craft underpinning hardware — counterpoint: early computing borrowed from looms.
    - Design motifs recur → 1980s sweaters mimicked IC masks as CAD and programmable knitting converged.
    - Artifacts as archives → rugs imagined as post-collapse schematics; nods to Canticle for Leibowitz and quips about timing and stone monoliths.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Art can decode microelectronics for lay audiences; mapping die features onto textiles humanizes otherwise abstract circuitry.
    - Impact: Bridges STEM and Indigenous craft; potential museum curricula linking 555 behavior to tactile exhibits and interactive die browsers.
    - Watch next: Publish high-res patterns and BOM-like dye/threads; run workshops; measure visitor learning vs datasheet-only instruction.
