# Over 80% of sunscreen performed below their labelled efficacy (2020)

- Score: 235 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45152374) | Link: https://www.consumer.org.hk/en/press-release/528-sunscreen-test

- TL;DR
  - Hong Kong’s Consumer Council (2020) lab-tested 30 sunscreens with EU methods: >80% failed labeled efficacy. Four measured below SPF15 (two labeled SPF50+); only 1/16 SPF50+ fully complied. Labels often lacked ingredients, usage amounts, or expiry; price didn’t predict performance. HN debate: minor SPF shortfalls may be negligible versus application variability, but extreme underperformance is serious deception. Many call for government-backed, independent testing and public brand naming (e.g., Germany’s Stiftung Warentest), while noting confusion with Australia’s separate, later CHOICE probe.

- Comment pulse
  - Minor SPF shortfalls matter less than application and test variance — counterpoint: SPF50+ products measuring <15 are outright deception.
  - Independent testing should be public infrastructure → lab tests are costly, risky; Germany’s Stiftung Warentest shows a viable model.
  - Lack of brand names reduces usefulness → readers want disclosure; some cite external lists and clarify no link to Australia’s 2025 CHOICE probe.

- LLM perspective
  - View: EU-style UVA/UVB standards and public brand naming would reduce confusion and deter underperformers.
  - Impact: Consumers shift to verified products; manufacturers invest in QA; retailers drop noncompliant lines.
  - Watch next: Inter-lab reproducibility benchmarks, FDA sunscreen monograph updates, and regulators mandating ingredient lists, usage amounts, expiry dates.
