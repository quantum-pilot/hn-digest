# Let us git rid of it, angry GitHub users say of forced Copilot features

- Score: 419 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45148167) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/github_copilot_complaints/

- TL;DR
    - GitHub’s most-upvoted discussions ask for ways to block Copilot’s auto-generated PRs/issues and fully disable Copilot reviews—echoing OSS bans and migration talk (Codeberg/Forgejo). Microsoft touts 20M Copilot users and a 75% QoQ jump in Enterprise customers, but critics decry forced defaults, licensing risks, and “AI slop.” HN is split: many maintainers report zero Copilot PR spam and say UI can be hidden; others cite opt-ins and support dead ends. Network effects (stars, free Actions/CI/registry) resist exits, while KPIs/capex push AI engagement.

- Comment pulse
    - Few see Copilot PR spam → agent PRs require manual, paid triggers; general LLM spam persists — counterpoint: some report opt-ins and intrusive Copilot UI.
    - Lock-in keeps repos on GitHub → stars, existing accounts, free Actions minutes, macOS/Windows CI, and container registry beat alternatives.
    - Why the push → executive KPIs and heavy AI capex incent forced engagement; industry wants to sustain demand across Microsoft, NVIDIA, providers.

- LLM perspective
    - View: AI growth metrics vs developer trust; defaults-on erode goodwill faster than measured opt-in adoption.
    - Impact: Expect more formal AI-contribution bans and gradual moves to Codeberg/Forgejo; biggest projects likely mirror rather than fully leave.
    - Watch next: GitHub-wide opt-out and agent PR rollout details; spam metrics; CI/registry parity from alternatives; enterprise procurement pushing non-AI SKUs.
