# AI surveillance should be banned while there is still time

- Score: 599 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45149281) | Link: https://gabrielweinberg.com/p/ai-surveillance-should-be-banned

- TL;DR
  - Gabriel Weinberg argues AI chats expose far more than web searches—personality, vulnerabilities, and habits—enabling precision manipulation, especially with chatbot memory. Recent incidents (leaked logs, prompt-injection data grabs, defaults shifting to training on chats) show privacy is unraveling. He urges Congress to ban AI surveillance and mandate protected, anonymous chats, noting DuckDuckGo’s offerings as proof of feasibility. HN commenters warn of unaccountable AI moderation and corporate power, debate local models versus “fiat” privacy, and fear retroactive thought-policing as chat logs become targets for advertisers, courts, and influence operations.

- Comment pulse
  - AI moderation concentrates unaccountable power → wrongful bans, opaque appeals, and automated hiring/insurance decisions spill into daily life.
  - Local models beat “fiat privacy” → on-device inference avoids surveillance; hardware vendors could win — counterpoint: incumbents will delay while capturing regulators.
  - Your chat logs will be weaponized → ad-bots and courts mine history to persuade or prosecute — counterpoint: some prefer personalized ads over irrelevant ones.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ban AI surveillance, require protected chats and opt-in training; incentivize local modes and robust memory controls.
  - Impact: Limits cloud data mining; pressures ad-tech; boosts device OEMs and privacy-first services; complicates law enforcement access.
  - Watch next: Federal AI privacy bill language, default training switches, leak incidents, local LLM benchmarks, and enforceable audit/compliance frameworks.
