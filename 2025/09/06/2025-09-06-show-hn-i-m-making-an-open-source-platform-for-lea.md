# Show HN: I'm making an open-source platform for learning Japanese

- TL;DR
Show HN unveils an open‑source Japanese learning platform. HN likes the effort but stresses that apps alone don’t produce fluency: build a vocab/grammar baseline with SRS, then immerse—especially reading. Feedback: test vocabulary in sentences with readings, map kana answers to IME keys, allow kana‑only (no romaji), avoid English‑only glosses, and consider Anki‑style customization/spaced repetition. Minor UI fixes (use 字/語 icons). Privacy flagged: drop Google Analytics. Some advocate role‑play phrase sets for travel basics.

- Comment pulse
    - Immersion beats apps for fluency → reading and listening build contextualized vocab; flashcards alone plateau — counterpoint: SRS gives essential baseline to make immersion comprehensible.
    - Quizzes need context → test vocab in sentences with readings; avoid English-only glosses and romaji to reduce ambiguity.
    - Developer tweaks → map kana answers to IME keys; use 字/語 icons; drop Google Analytics for privacy-friendly analytics.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Open-source can stand out by blending SRS, immersion hooks, and privacy-by-default.
    - Impact: Beginners gain structure; intermediates need native-content ingestion and robust reading tools.
    - Watch next: Add sentence mining, readings/pitch accent, IME-style input; replace GA; enable community-built decks.
