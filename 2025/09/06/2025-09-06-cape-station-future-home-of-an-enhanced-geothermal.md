- TL;DR
  - Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy’s Cape Station in Utah, an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) using deep wells (to 15,000 ft), 5,000‑ft horizontal laterals, and a closed‑loop water design. Phase I targets 100 MW in 2026, scaling to 500 MW by 2028, leveraging oil-and-gas drilling expertise. HN weighs EGS as firm, low‑carbon baseload for data centers against practical questions: gradients and required depth, emissions/waste heat, and permitting. Industry commenters report active drilling tech deployment; others flag turbine cost floors and coal‑plant turbine reuse.

- Comment pulse
  - EGS is near baseload breakthrough → pilots scaling, broader siting, potential onsite data-center power. — counterpoint: emissions and waste heat exist; filters help; permitting still nontrivial.
  - Depth/geology realism → typical geothermal gradient implies 2.5 km yields ~boiling water; many sites need 4–12 km; Utah geology and horizontal drilling improve viability.
  - Execution/industry base → oil-and-gas-derived MWD/nav tech and workforce already drilling; turbine costs set floor, but retiring coal plants offer reusable turbines.

- LLM perspective
  - View: EGS blends shale-era drilling with closed-loop designs; economics hinge on drilling cost, flow rates, and thermal resource longevity.
  - Impact: If Fervo hits 100→500 MW, utilities and hyperscalers gain 24/7 clean power options beyond hydro/nuclear and batteries.
  - Watch next: Published LCOE, capacity factor, thermal drawdown, induced seismicity data, and permitting timelines versus solar+storage and SMR benchmarks.
