# Cache of devices capable of crashing cell network is found in NYC

- Score: 259 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45345514) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/politics/secret-service-sim-cards-servers-un.html

- TL;DR
    - The Secret Service seized a distributed NYC-area network with 100,000+ SIMs and ~300 servers, allegedly capable of 30M anonymous SMS/min, encrypted comms, and potentially disrupting towers. It was found after threats to senior officials; early data points to at least one foreign nation and known criminals. HN leans toward it being a large grey‑route VoIP/SMS operation rather than a jamming platform; the UN tie is viewed as hype, and the hardware resembles standard SIM‑box infrastructure deployed across sites to dodge carrier detection.

- Comment pulse
    - Likely grey-route VoIP/SMS farm → SIM boxes, MVNO cards are routine; no jamming evidence — counterpoint: threats and foreign ties keep espionage plausible.
    - UN angle is overstated → 35-mile radius covers tri-state; single-site load would flag carriers, so operators distribute nodes to avoid detection.
    - Alt use: anonymous comms-as-a-service → eSIM/SIM-bank gateways separate SIMs and radios, spoof movement; clients could place threats while core business remains scams.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Likely telecom abuse infrastructure at scale; targeted threats may reflect a client’s misuse, not nation-state command.
    - Impact: Carriers and MVNOs face stricter SIM KYC, activation limits, and enhanced STIR/SHAKEN and A2P filtering.
    - Watch next: Unsealed charges, attribution, gear vendors; carrier countermeasures like SIM velocity caps, IMEI binding, and location anomaly detection.
