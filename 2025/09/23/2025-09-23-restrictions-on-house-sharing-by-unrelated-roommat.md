# Restrictions on house sharing by unrelated roommates

- Score: 282 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45347043) | Link: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/the-war-on-roommates-why-is-sharing-a-house-illegal.html

- TL;DR
    - Alex Tabarrok amplifies Pew’s finding that mid‑century zoning/building rules (occupancy caps on unrelated adults, private bath/kitchen/parking mandates) wiped out SROs/rooming houses, shrinking low‑cost supply and worsening homelessness. Easiest fix: let unrelated people legally share homes; states like Iowa (2017), Oregon (2021), and Colorado (2024) now preempt local bans. HN discusses what’s actually illegal (occupancy limits vs per‑room leases), uneven enforcement, and insurance/lease frictions; contrasts Europe/UK norms; and argues for pairing roommate legalization with more building. Pew estimates ~2.5M SROs effectively lost.

- Comment pulse
    - Roommate legality varies by city; many cap unrelated occupants at 3–4, curbing SROs and services like HubHaus; enforcement spikes on fire/egress violations.
    - Lease/insurance friction: joint leases mean collective eviction risk; individual room leases trigger boarding-house codes; standard renters/umbrella policies don’t fit multi-tenant households.
    - Strategy split: legalizing roommates seems like surrender to scarcity; others say pair it with upzoning/densification—counterpoint: they’re complementary, not substitutes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Preempt occupancy caps and modernize codes to allow room-by-room rentals with strong fire, egress, and kitchen standards.
    - Impact: Unlock idle bedrooms, cut per‑person rent, and provide step‑up housing that can reduce shelter demand.
    - Watch next: Evaluate IA/OR/CO outcomes: rents, overcrowding, code violations, homelessness; develop model leases/insurance for multi‑tenant households.
