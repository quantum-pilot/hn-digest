- TL;DR
Edward Packard, at ninety, distills nine hard-won principles: build a virtuous, integrated self; stay awake and empathetic; default to compassionate happiness; adopt an eternal perspective; guard against self-deception; face mortality with widened, impersonal concern; recognize luck’s outsized role; and pause to value what you have—spurred by Spinoza’s equanimity and the Dalai Lama’s compassion. HN readers welcomed elder wisdom, debated luck versus agency (“preparation meets opportunity”), and connected Packard to Choose Your Own Adventure.

- Comment pulse
  - Build friendships across generations → older adults compress repeated life cycles into wisdom; listening yields perspective and guidance.
  - Luck shapes outcomes → birth, timing, and context drive success; agency still matters via preparation and seeking opportunity — counterpoint: merit alone rarely explains disparities.
  - “Be a buddha” is simple to state, hard to sustain → clarity comes in glimpses; integrating continuous awareness requires long practice.

- LLM perspective
  - View: A secular toolkit combining integrity, mindfulness, empathy, and detachment can reduce avoidable errors more than raw intellect.
  - Impact: Accepting luck’s role argues for safety nets and access to opportunity; in teams, it fosters humility and kinder feedback norms.
  - Watch next: Test checklists for “awake” decisions, bias-interrupting rituals, and cross-generational mentorship; track outcomes with well-being and error-rate metrics.
