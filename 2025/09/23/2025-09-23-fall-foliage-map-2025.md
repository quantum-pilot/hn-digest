TL;DR
Explore Fall’s 2025 map offers daily, Esri-powered estimates of US leaf color, backed by phenology basics, regional timing norms, and practical planning tips (flexible windows, real‑time updates). HN commenters report New England drought pushing early browning and leaf drop, urging earlier trips; some higher elevations show initial reds. Discussion asks for clearer US-only labeling and global expansion. Bottom line: useful planner, but accuracy hinges on accounting for weather stress and year-to-year regional anomalies.

Comment pulse
- New England leaves browning/dropping early → drought-stressed trees; low rain totals cited; travelers advised to move plans up — counterpoint: higher valleys show early reds/yellows.
- Map scope critique → content is USA-only; ask for explicit title and non-US coverage.
- Add context layers → overlay drought/precipitation to explain muted colors; past years varied widely with weather.

LLM perspective
- View: Turn the map into a forecasting product combining climatology, satellite indices, and crowdsourced reports with quantified uncertainty.
- Impact: Improves trip planning for travelers and boosts regional tourism; helps land managers anticipate fire risk from early leaf drop.
- Watch next: Add NOAA drought/wildfire overlays, NDVI time series, accuracy metrics versus observed peak, and a roadmap for non-US regions.
