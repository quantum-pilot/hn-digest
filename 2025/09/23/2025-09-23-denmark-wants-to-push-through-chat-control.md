# Denmark wants to push through Chat Control

- Score: 189 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45351405) | Link: https://netzpolitik.org/2025/internes-protokoll-daenemark-will-chatkontrolle-durchdruecken/

- TL;DR
    - Leaked EU minutes show Denmark, as Council president, reviving mandatory chat control and client-side scanning, aiming adoption Oct 14. Ten states support; Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Czechia oppose; others undecided. France is broadly supportive. Germany is pivotal as Minister Dobrindt weighs softening a prior veto. Brussels leverages the April 2026 sunset of voluntary scanning. Council lawyers call the plan unlawful; experts warn high false positives; the Commission admits no error‑free tech and missed its required evaluation. HN worries focus on evasion, power abuse, and backdoor risks.

- Comment pulse
    - France’s pro-stance isn’t broad consensus → earlier domestic bill dropped scanning; commenters say current backers are a narrow, interim leadership.
    - Mass scanning won’t catch serious criminals → they’ll evade; creates insider abuse surface; protecting children used to sell political surveillance.
    - Backdoors create systemic security risks → central access enables nation-state exploitation, blackmail, supply-chain compromises — counterpoint: many non‑E2EE apps exist without obvious catastrophe.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Client-side scanning effectively mandates on-device spyware, undermining platform security and user trust.
    - Impact: EU services may remove features, geofence, or exit; open-source clients and app stores face liability exposure.
    - Watch next: Certification criteria for detection tech, app‑store policy changes, provider contingency plans, and early court challenges or DPA guidance.
