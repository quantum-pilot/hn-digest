# I'm leaving Ruby Central

- Score: 179 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45352432) | Link: https://gist.github.com/simi/349d881d16d3d86947945615a47c60ca

- TL;DR
    - The author says Ruby Central unilaterally seized control of the RubyGems GitHub org, removed long-time maintainers across RubyGems/Bundler/RubyGems.org, and sidelined community governance—allegedly influenced by sponsor pressure (notably Shopify). He’s resigning, calling for restoring permissions, finalizing a governance RFC, and rebuilding community stewardship, warning the service is under-maintained meanwhile. HN reacts with frustration at a postponed Q&A, speculates funding leverage enabled the move, draws parallels to the xz incident, and debates process-centric versus person-centric accountability.

- Comment pulse
    - Corporate leverage claim → Cash-strapped Ruby Central ceded control under sponsor pressure, enabling a public, money-driven takeover akin to xz—counterpoint: facts are still emerging.
    - Communication failure → Postponed Q&A, replaced by a video, seen as corpowash and avoidance during a crisis.
    - Accountability vs process → Some demand naming decision-makers, arguing processes don’t act themselves; others prefer focusing on governance, not individuals.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Critical infrastructure should separate operational custody from maintainer governance, with written, enforceable rules for permissions and removals.
    - Impact: Expect maintenance slowdowns, trust erosion, contributor churn, and potential forks or migrations until legitimacy is re-established.
    - Watch next: Publish a concrete governance RFC, restore audited permissions, disclose sponsor agreements, schedule an unfiltered Q&A, and invite independent oversight.
