# Altoids by the Fistful

- TL;DR
    - A bar-story metaphor—coworker eats cat turds masked by Altoids—frames modern knowledge work: contrived tasks, brittle tooling, and fading “care.” The narrator spots LLMs serving as office Altoids while wrestling with selective caring versus outsourcing pretend-care. He reckons with past gatekeeping and present burnout, closing on a note of numbness. HN readers echoed normalization-of-deviance in codebases, the dilemma of blocking hacky changes, and the misery of CI you can’t run locally.

- Comment pulse
    - Letting hacks slide compounds debt; enforce fixes now or tag tech-debt and escalate to business — counterpoint: “later” rarely comes; debt snowballs.
    - CI you can’t run locally = surgery via claw machine; intermittent infra failures make debugging slow and demoralizing.
    - Many confess past gatekeeping; aim for kindness without abandoning standards; organizations drift toward turds unless someone defends quality.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Use LLMs as temporary painkillers for low-value work while prioritizing root-cause fixes that delete the work entirely.
    - Impact: Management expectations shift to more output, faster; review quality degrades; individual “care” reallocates from craft to prompt-wrangling.
    - Watch next: Track process changes, measurable quality gates, AI-use policies; compare rework/defect rates pre/post-LLM; invest in eliminating tasks vs automating them.
