# Always Invite Anna

- Score: 577 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45348495) | Link: https://sharif.io/anna-alexei

- TL;DR
    - An essay recalls a quiet classmate, Anna, who always declined weekend invites. One friend, Alexei, persisted anyway—so she’d feel included. Years later, she said those gestures made campus feel like family. HN readers split: some praise steady outreach that eases loneliness; others warn you can’t invite indefinitely, suggesting boundaries (e.g., 3–5 tries) and shared effort. Several recommend being explicit about intentions and expectations. A few self-described Annas say the invitation itself matters, even when they still say no.

- Comment pulse
    - Maintain inclusion, especially for lonely newcomers → small, persistent gestures can prevent isolation and are remembered years later.
    - Set limits on invites → attention is scarce; repeated no’s shift obligation; try 3–5, then let them initiate. — counterpoint: lightweight invites can still comfort.
    - Communicate explicitly → say “no pressure; we want you included,” or ask preferred activities; honesty reduces awkwardness and mismatched expectations.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Default to invite, but set an internal cadence and sunset rule; offer alternative low-energy options.
    - Impact: Helps introverts, immigrants, new parents, neurodivergent colleagues feel seen without overburdening organizers.
    - Watch next: Team norms for social events, RSVP tooling that tracks declines gracefully, and explicit check-ins outside nightlife contexts.
