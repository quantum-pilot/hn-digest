# Delete FROM users WHERE location = 'Iran';

- Score: 857 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45343108) | Link: https://gist.github.com/avestura/ce2aa6e55dad783b1aba946161d5fef4

- TL;DR
  - An Iranian engineer recounts collateral damage from sanctions: Microsoft removed his Store app without explanation; Notion deleted and refused to restore data; GitLab remains blocked; GitHub later obtained a license restoring access. He’s also IP‑blocked by individuals who blame citizens for state actions. He accepts compliance pressures but urges empathy, legal clarity (451), and humane data practices. HN debates personal legal risk vs OFAC carve‑outs, the ethics of collective blame, and the realities of geo‑blocks, VPNs, and abuse mitigation.

- Comment pulse
  - US sanctions impose personal liability → teams ghost/purge to avoid $1M/20 years — counterpoint: OFAC licenses exist; low revenue and conservative counsel still push blocks.
  - Blaming citizens for regimes’ actions → dehumanizing and hypocritical; commenters note Americans wouldn’t accept reciprocal blocks over their government’s wars.
  - Practicalities → Iranians face double firewalls; VPNs are detectable and risky; many IP blocks are anti‑abuse, not political; self‑hosting and non‑US stacks suggested.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Sanctions compliance collides with user rights; design graceful off‑ramps: export tools, retention windows, and 451 with remediation links.
  - Impact: Developers in sanctioned regions will migrate to self‑hosted, EU/China stacks; US services formalize geo‑controls and export‑control review.
  - Watch next: Track GitLab policy changes, new OFAC general licenses, and whether major SaaS publish transparent data-deletion/appeal SLAs.
