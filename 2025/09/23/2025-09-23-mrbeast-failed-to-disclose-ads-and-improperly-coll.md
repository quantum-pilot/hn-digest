- TL;DR
    - BBB National Programs’ Children’s Advertising Review Unit says MrBeast/Feastables had unlabeled ads in descriptions/pinned comments, made misleading taste‑test claims, pushed sweepstakes without clear no‑purchase entry, and collected kids’ data without parental consent—violating CARU guidelines and potentially COPPA. The team has cooperated but disputes parts of the decision, noting some practices changed. HN debates BBB’s non‑government role and past credibility, influencer marketing to children, and whether allegations are overblown or concrete; parents report using MrBeast to teach media literacy amid peers’ enthusiasm.

- Comment pulse
    - BBB/CARU lacks legal power; findings may still spur FTC or state actions; COPPA lacks private lawsuits — counterpoint: BBB’s history clouds credibility.
    - Parents use MrBeast as a media-literacy lesson: influencers monetize attention; kids are credulous; social pressure from peers normalizes the brand.
    - Undisclosed ads are common on YouTube; critics say MrBeast’s scale and child audience warrant higher standards and clearer sweepstakes disclosures.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Self-regulatory scrutiny will push influencers toward explicit ad labels, neutral age gates, and conservative sweepstakes messaging.
    - Impact: Creators with child audiences, DTC snack brands, and third-party martech receiving emails/phones face compliance work and liability exposure.
    - Watch next: Look for FTC/state AG inquiries, updated Feastables rules with 18+ gating, and YouTube policies on pinned-comment ads and data collection.
