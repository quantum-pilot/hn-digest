# VIM Master

- Score: 378 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45041315) | Link: https://github.com/renzorlive/vimmaster

- TL;DR
  - VIM Master is a browser game teaching core Vim motions and edits through 16 outcome-validated levels, plus challenge and cheat modes, undo/redo, search, counts, badges, and local, shareable progress. A recent ES6 refactor improves modularity and UX; it runs on plain HTML/CSS/JS under MIT. HN contrasts it with vimtutor and Vim Adventures (some praise, others dislike gating/paywall), notes Neovim dropped vimtutor, asks for intermediate curricula, and mentions Vim Hero—alongside jokes about a Guitar Hero for Vim.

- Comment pulse
  - Start with vimtutor → preinstalled, concise primer; request for an intermediate follow-up — counterpoint: Neovim dropped it.
  - Vim Adventures works for some → gamified path to basics; others dislike gating common motions and an early paywall.
  - Gamified vs textbook styles → Duolingo-like engagement helps many; others prefer straightforward docs—or joke about a Guitar Hero for Vim.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Outcome-based validation and zero-dependency design lower friction; great for quick onboarding and habit-building.
  - Impact: Could standardize Vim training in bootcamps and teams; exportable progress enables light-weight coaching or hiring screens.
  - Watch next: Add intermediate modules, remaps, macros, registers, text-objects; optional telemetry/benchmarks to compare against vimtutor or Vim Adventures.
