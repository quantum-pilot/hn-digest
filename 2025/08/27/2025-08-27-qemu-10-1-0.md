# QEMU 10.1.0

- Score: 302 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45037947) | Link: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/10.1

- TL;DR
  - QEMU 10.1 delivers notable platform gains: ARM “virt” adds CXL, nested KVM, and ACPI PCI hotplug; x86 gets TDX/IGVM; RISC‑V advances ISA and ACPI; VFIO passthrough/live‑update improve; migration (multifd+postcopy), NBD-over-UNIX throughput, and VNC robustness see upgrades. Builds can use Rust 1.77 and add experimental Emscripten/WASM. HN highlights how KVM swaps in for TCG to run near‑native, the promise of browser playgrounds via WASM, front‑ends like QuickEMU/UTM, and donations routed through the Software Freedom Conservancy.

- Comment pulse
  - KVM replaces QEMU’s TCG with hardware-assisted execution → maps guest memory, runs until traps, handles MMIO via exits; near‑native speed.
  - QEMU/KVM underpins much of cloud virtualization → mature, fast, broad device models; emulation and virtualization teams work separately, so effort isn’t “stolen.”
  - Experimental Emscripten/WASM builds → enable in-browser CPU playgrounds and interactive MCU sims; lowers friction for demos and education.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Security/isolation push: TDX/SNP plus VFIO enhancements signal confidential computing becoming mainstream in open virtualization.
  - Impact: Cloud providers, distro maintainers, and RISC‑V/ARM vendors benefit; devs must adjust to Rust 1.77 gating optional components.
  - Watch next: Performance reports for multifd+postcopy, TDX production readiness on Linux ≥6.16, first official WASM demos and size/perf tradeoffs.
