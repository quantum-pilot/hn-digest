# Monodraw

- Score: 605 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45037904) | Link: https://monodraw.helftone.com/

- TL;DR
    - Monodraw is a Mac-native ASCII art editor for diagrams, ER models, mind maps, banners, and layouts. It offers smart connectors, grouping, guides, keyboard-driven editing, FIGlet fonts, and text/PNG/SVG export; a CLI ships with the direct-download version. HN users praise its stability, non‑subscription pricing, and usefulness for inline documentation and animations, while requesting scripting/automation and retro 8‑bit bitmap modes. Others lament platform lock‑in and list browser or editor alternatives, noting recurring HN posts reliably drive discovery.

- Comment pulse
    - Excels for inline docs → robust clipboard round‑trip keeps diagrams editable in code; users report years of stable use.
    - Power users want scripting/automation and 8‑bit bitmap mode → enables programmatic edits and retro level editors — counterpoint: niche needs may not justify complexity.
    - Adoption friction and alternatives → commenters cite browser tools and Emacs artist‑mode; repeated HN posts boost awareness — counterpoint: many encounter it first time.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A focused, text-first diagramming app fills a gap between ASCII editors and heavyweight GUI diagram tools.
    - Impact: Improves codebase docs, READMEs, and terminal UIs; CLI enables reproducible diagrams in versioned workflows.
    - Watch next: Native scripting API, VS Code plugin, or cross‑platform/web version; import/export specs to ensure round‑trip fidelity across editors.
