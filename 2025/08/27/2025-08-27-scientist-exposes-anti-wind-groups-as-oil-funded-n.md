# Scientist exposes anti-wind groups as oil-funded, now they want to silence him

- TL;DR
  - Brown University’s Climate & Development Lab mapped ties between anti–offshore-wind groups, right-leaning legal networks, and fossil-fuel funding, arguing coordinated lawsuits and whale-focused misinformation delay or kill projects. After publication, a named law firm demanded Brown rein in the lab, allegedly threatening to leverage federal funding—sparking concerns over academic freedom. HN discussion centers on politicized attacks on wind, astroturfed opposition as an incumbents’ tactic, and real siting/intermittency constraints. Commenters debate donations influencing policy and call for by-right permitting of low-externality projects.

- Comment pulse
  - Wind policy shift is political → lawsuits, misinformation (e.g., whale deaths, inflated costs) and executive halts stall nearly finished projects; some note opposition predates administration.
  - Astroturfing as tactic → incumbents fund activists to sue and delay; by-right permitting for low-externality builds could blunt this — counterpoint: donors fund pro-wind too.
  - Siting and grid limits matter → avoid key reserves; intermittency needs backup or imports; Denmark exports surplus yet still imports much power during lulls.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Funding-pressure letters resemble SLAPP dynamics; best antidotes are transparency, independent replication, and anti-SLAPP protections for researchers.
  - Impact: Lawsuit-driven delays raise offshore wind capex and financing costs; utilities and ratepayers absorb overruns; universities may self-censor policy research.
  - Watch next: Brown’s response; outcomes of offshore cases; permitting reforms; whale-strike rulemaking; storage buildout metrics on curtailment and imports.
