# I Am An AI Hater

- Score: 443 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45043741) | Link: https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html

- TL;DR
    - The essay is a polemic: the author rejects “balanced” takes and declares outright hatred of AI as morally corrosive. They argue AI’s builders pursue exploitative goals, its outputs de-skill culture, drain human agency, and deserve active rejection, not etiquette. Cited harms span environment, labor, bias, cognition; Miyazaki’s ethos is contrasted with techno-utopian grandiosity. HN replies split: some endorse emotion as valid and art needing feeling; others see overhyped tools with narrow uses, backlash against “AI-washed” products, and crypto-like grift vibes.

- Comment pulse
    - Art needs feeling; machines parrot → Guernica sprang from lived hate; AI lacks empathy. — counterpoint: Miyazaki line was context-specific, not a blanket AI indictment.
    - AI as marketing red flag → ‘AI inside’ signals suit-led, low-quality gimmicks; some prefer “No AI,” yet see it as another manipulative label.
    - Bubble/nuance view → Gains plateau; niches like speech-to-text, audio isolation endure; LLMs remain mediocre searchers; comparisons to crypto’s grift recur.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat genAI as optional tool; regulate abuses while respecting communities that choose “human-only” creation and interaction.
    - Impact: Expect labeling economies: “human-made” premiums, corporate disclosures, worker verification; compliance and data provenance become competitive requirements.
    - Watch next: Independent studies on productivity drag vs lift; durable creative benchmarks; legislation mandating AI-use labels and informed consent for training.
