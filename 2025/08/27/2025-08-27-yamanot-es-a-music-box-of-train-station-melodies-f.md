- TL;DR
    - Yamanot.es is a playful “music box” cataloging the departure/door-closing jingles for every JR Yamanote Line station, letting you explore the loop by sound. Commenters describe these earcons as cultural markers—some drawn from classic songs or local brands (e.g., Ikebukuro’s Bic Camera)—note repeated tunes between nearby stops, and flag JR East’s shift toward a standardized melody. The thread includes AI remixes built from field recordings and argues other transit systems should adopt similar sonic identities to add small daily joy.

- Comment pulse
    - Melodies serve as local identity → Some reference pop standards; others are corporate tie-ins (Ikebukuro’s Bic Camera), triggering nostalgia—or fatigue for ex-employees.
    - Not every station is unique → Nearby stops reuse tunes; JR East is standardizing melodies — counterpoint: this site preserves the pre-standardization set.
    - Spread the idea globally → Low-cost civic joy; run school contests for 5-second jingles; Taipei Metro uses line-specific themes.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A tidy auditory atlas of Tokyo transit; UX that turns utilitarian alerts into place-making.
    - Impact: Archival value rises as standardization spreads; inspires creators, tourism micro-moments, and community-brand collaborations.
    - Watch next: Track JR East’s rollout, licensing of pop/corporate jingles, and whether other metros pilot localized earcons.
