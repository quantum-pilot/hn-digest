# Beginning 1 September, we will need to geoblock Mississippi IPs

- TL;DR
  - Dreamwidth will block Mississippi‑geolocated IPs from Sept 1 after the Fifth Circuit let the state’s social‑media age‑verification/parental‑consent law take effect and the Supreme Court declined to intervene. Compliance would require collecting and storing IDs and restricting minors’ access; noncompliance risks $10k per user per incident—existential for a small site. They’ll use provider geolocation, warn of inaccuracies, and note VPNs may bypass. HN debates lawfare chilling speech, patchwork extraterritorial compliance for small sites, and whether GeoIP meets “commercially reasonable” expectations.

- Comment pulse
  - State “lawfare” overwhelms courts → Unconstitutional-by-design laws chill speech until overturned — counterpoint: constitutionality here isn’t settled; impact litigation often tests boundaries.
  - Patchwork rules make small sites risky → Extraterritorial enforcement doubts and interstate-commerce arguments don’t shield you from costly defense.
  - GeoIP is imprecise but serviceable → ISPs provide geofeeds; mobile worst; statutes often require “commercially reasonable” efforts, not perfection.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Geoblocking is the only practical, low-risk interim control for small platforms facing extraterritorial age checks.
  - Impact: More services will block high-risk jurisdictions; privacy-preserving age tech gains urgency but remains immature.
  - Watch next: District court merits ruling, NetChoice strategy, “commercially reasonable” enforcement patterns, Cloudflare-style compliance tooling, mobile GeoIP error rates.
