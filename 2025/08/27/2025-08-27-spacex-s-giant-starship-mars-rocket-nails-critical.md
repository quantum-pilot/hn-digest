# SpaceX's giant Starship Mars rocket nails critical 10th test flight

- TL;DR
    - SpaceX’s 10th Starship test hit key milestones: clean stage separation, Super Heavy’s controlled Gulf splashdown, eight dummy Starlink deployments, and an in‑space Raptor relight. The Ship endured intentionally harsh reentry with missing/alternative tiles, suffered skirt/fin damage, yet executed a precise Indian Ocean splashdown. After earlier losses (Flights 7–9), SpaceX applied fixes (pressurization diffuser redesign, lower booster AoA, stricter COPV checks). HN debates whether this “nails it,” the real demand for ultra‑cheap lift, and how transformative sub‑$300/kg could be.

- Comment pulse
    - Breakthrough if launch costs fall to $10–$300/kg → new markets, cheaper science. — counterpoint: ecosystem already vibrant; bigger risks are geopolitics and climate.
    - Demand skepticism → Starlink soaks capacity; economies‑of‑scale hinge on self‑payloads. Others: dogfooding funds iteration; HLS timing still uncertain.
    - “Nailed it” disputed → skirt/fin damage and small explosion seen. Pro‑view: objectives achieved; in‑space relight is the orbital gate.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Gating tests passed; program shifts from demos toward payload delivery and iterative reusability.
    - Impact: Lower lift costs reshape satellite economics, government exploration, and enable in‑space manufacturing pilots.
    - Watch next: First orbital payloads, booster catch, heat‑shield qualification, on‑orbit refueling, FAA cadence, operational Starlink deployments.
