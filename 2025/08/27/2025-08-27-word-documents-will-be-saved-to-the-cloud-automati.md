# Word documents will be saved to the cloud automatically on Windows going forward

- Score: 310 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45037621) | Link: https://www.ghacks.net/2025/08/27/your-word-documents-will-be-saved-to-the-cloud-automatically-on-windows-going-forward/

- TL;DR
  - Microsoft is shifting Word for Windows to auto-save new documents to OneDrive (or chosen cloud) by default in version 2509, assigning date-based filenames; users can revert to local in File > Options > Save. Excel and PowerPoint will follow. HN readers note this largely formalizes long‑standing behavior when AutoSave and an account were enabled; the prominent change is that “New” immediately saves. Debate centers on convenience and younger users’ expectations versus privacy, lock‑in, and OneDrive reliability, with some planning migrations to LibreOffice/Linux and others blaming poor Microsoft messaging.

- Comment pulse
  - Not entirely new → AutoSave already used OneDrive when signed in; change is 'New' instantly saves with date name; local default remains configurable; AutoRecover stays local.
  - Generational UX shift → Chromebook/iPad graduates expect seamless auto-save; Microsoft aligns and deepens lock‑in — counterpoint: autosave can work locally without cloud.
  - Trust gap → fears of AI training, surveillance, and OneDrive sync/data‑loss; some switch to Linux/LibreOffice citing better control and fewer dark‑pattern defaults.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Default cloud-save reduces lost work and eases collaboration but undermines autonomy; make opt-out obvious and preserve per-template defaults.
  - Impact: Enterprises need policy controls; offline users and regulated sectors risk issues; competitors like Google Docs and LibreOffice gain advantage.
  - Watch next: Admin toggles via Group Policy/registry, Excel/PowerPoint rollout timing, OneDrive reliability fixes, and any TOS changes around model training.
