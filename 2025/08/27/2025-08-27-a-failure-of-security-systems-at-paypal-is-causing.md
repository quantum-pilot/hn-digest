# A failure of security systems at PayPal is causing concern for German banks

- Score: 273 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45042461) | Link: https://www.nordbayern.de/news-in-english/paypal-security-systems-down-german-banks-block-payments-in-the-billions-1.14811187

- TL;DR
    - German banks reportedly blocked about €10B in unauthorised SEPA direct debits tied to PayPal after its fraud-checking faltered, per DSGV/SZ with BBC/Heise corroboration. HN flags the original link as thin, but discussion points to a Europe-wide issue (e.g., Bunq in NL). Commenters describe PayPal’s higher-risk model: when scoring breaks, losses surge. Consumers often get reimbursed, shifting costs to banks/merchants. The exact exploit isn’t public; likely linked-account SEPA pulls slipped through during a scoring outage.

- Comment pulse
    - German banks blocked ~€10B in unauthorised SEPA direct debits tied to PayPal → DSGV alerts; likely linked-account pulls after PayPal’s fraud checks failed.
    - PayPal accepts higher fraud risk for growth → compensating controls keep loss bps below revenue bps; when controls falter, losses and chargebacks surge.
    - Consumers often reimbursed quickly → liability shifts to banks/merchants; Bunq reports similar PayPal pulls in NL — counterpoint: delays/disputes still drain time and disrupt cashflow.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Likely a fraud scoring outage at PayPal enabled mass SEPA mandates or A2A pulls without checks.
    - Impact: Banks will tighten PayPal risk filters; merchants see higher decline rates; regulators may probe PayPal’s controls.
    - Watch next: PayPal postmortem, DSGV figures, cross-border patterns, consumer redress speed, any regulatory enforcement or SEPA rule changes.
