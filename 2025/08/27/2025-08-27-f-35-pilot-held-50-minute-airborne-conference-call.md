# F-35 pilot held 50-minute airborne conference call with engineers before crash

- Score: 300 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45038261) | Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/us/alaska-f-35-crash-accident-report-hnk-ml

- TL;DR
    - An F-35A at Eielson AFB crashed after a landing-gear malfunction in −1°F conditions escalated: jammed gear triggered “on-ground” mode, aircraft became uncontrollable, pilot ejected; $200M loss. An Air Force report cites water-contaminated hydraulic servicing, HAZMAT oversight lapses, and decision-making—including a 50‑minute consult with Lockheed engineers and a second touch‑and‑go—despite prior LM cold‑weather guidance. HN readers debate CNN’s framing of the call, note unlinked source documents, and focus on maintenance contamination and cold‑weather sensor behavior rather than blaming software alone.

- Comment pulse
    - Media framing → CNN implied pilot joined; report shows SOF relayed radio-to-phone; no official recording. — counterpoint: MP initiated the conference.
    - Root cause → Not “ice” alone; barrel-stored fluid contaminated, ~one‑third water; similar fault recurred Feb 6; maintenance oversight repeatedly flagged.
    - System behavior → Weight‑on‑wheels sensors gated modes; commenters split on allowing overrides; many expect emergency gear‑down options, but overriding WoW risks damage.

- LLM perspective
     - View: This is a socio‑technical failure across maintenance, documentation, human factors, and mode‑logic design, not a single “software bug.”
	   - Impact: Expect tightened hydraulic servicing, cold‑weather procedures, logging of advisory comms, and revised guidance dissemination across F‑35 fleets and cold‑base units.
	   - Watch next: Corrective memos, contamination audits, WoW‑logic updates, simulator guidance discouraging touch‑and‑go retries, and whether CNN adds a correction and source link.
