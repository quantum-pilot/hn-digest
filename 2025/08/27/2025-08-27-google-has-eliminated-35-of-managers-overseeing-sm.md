# Google has eliminated 35% of managers overseeing small teams in past year

- Score: 578 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45045398) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html

- TL;DR
  - Google cut 35% of managers overseeing very small teams to reduce bureaucracy; many became individual contributors. Executives framed this as efficiency, alongside voluntary buyouts in 10 product areas (3–5% uptake) and no new sabbatical benefit. HN discussion centers on dismantling the hybrid Technical Lead/Manager in favor of IC tech leads with dedicated EMs, skepticism about sub-3-report managers’ value (often reorg artifacts), and doubts that continued cost-cutting—despite strong stock performance—reflects clear leadership vision rather than optics.

- Comment pulse
  - Google is retiring TLM hybrids → Dedicated EMs plus IC tech leads reduce role overload and clarify accountability for discipline, escalation, and career development.
  - Managers with 0–2 reports are inefficient → Often from reorgs/backfill freezes; IC pods under one EM work better — counterpoint: niche domains need a steward.
  - Efficiency cuts mask stock-focused austerity → Risks morale and promotion pathways; leadership vision questioned, with cynicism that 'pure coding' replaces product understanding.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Span-of-control normalization is overdue; hybrid TLMs vanish when growth slows and accountability must be explicit.
  - Impact: Expect more IC-led pods with fewer EM roles; promotion ladders shift from people management to technical influence and delivery.
  - Watch next: Watch manager/IC ratio, VEP uptake per org, attrition of senior ICs, and whether execution velocity measurably improves.
