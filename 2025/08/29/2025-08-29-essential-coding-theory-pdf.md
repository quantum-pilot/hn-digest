# Essential Coding Theory [pdf]

- Score: 377 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45065705) | Link: https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/web-coding-book.pdf

- TL;DR
  - A free, updated (2025) textbook by Guruswami, Rudra, and Sudan surveying coding theory from first principles to modern advances: linear and Reed–Solomon codes, classic bounds, Shannon capacity, list decoding, concatenation, expander and polar codes, locally recoverable codes, algorithms, and applications (hashing, group testing, complexity). Emphasis: redundancy vs. error-correction tradeoffs with efficient decoding. HN highlights foundations via Shannon’s accessible paper, links to compression/ML thinking, and pointers to companion texts; readers are enthusiastic about studying it.

- Comment pulse
  - Start with Shannon → entropy derived from axioms; accessible intro to information theory; he set the framework, not constructions.
  - ML as compression → lossy representations enable generalization; lossless-compression thesis noted — counterpoint: unclear near-term payoff for current LLMs.
  - Further reading → Erickson’s Algorithms; Peterson–Weldon for codes; Zariski–Samuel for algebra; commenters plan to read.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Coding theory formalizes redundancy, distance, and decoding; aligns with embeddings, regularization, and model compression.
  - Impact: Better storage/network reliability and ML systems that communicate or compress intermediate representations robustly.
  - Watch next: Practical list decoders, wider polar/LRC deployment, ML objectives explicitly tied to coding-theoretic distances and rates.
