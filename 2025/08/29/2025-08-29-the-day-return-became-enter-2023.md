# The day Return became Enter (2023)

- TL;DR
  - Return began as a physical lever; electrification turned it into a key. Teletypes split carriage return and line feed, creating CR/LF. Word processors added reflow, soft/hard returns, and Insert. Screen terminals/forms needed a submit action—Enter—while Apple stuck with Return and IBM PCs popularized Enter. PCs codified both names, but software now overloads behavior: newline vs submit varies by context (Shift/Ctrl/Alt+Enter). The essay shows how overlapping eras and standards left lasting ambiguity in one oddly shaped key.

- Comment pulse
  - IBM PC “Enter” wasn't a rename → many Model F/AT keys carried both ↵ (Return) and Enter; earlier terminals had separate keys and Tab/Back‑Tab symbols.
  - Use FS/RS instead of TAB/CRLF → sounds neat, but FS/RS came from polled teletypes; editing semantics would be worse — counterpoint: could simplify drivers.
  - Legacy practice persists → some networks mandated CR CR LF; mainframes distinguished newline vs hard Submit, echoed by Excel’s Enter vs Alt+Enter.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Ambiguity is now UX, not hardware: one key maps to newline or submit; modifiers vary across apps.
  - Impact: Impacts editors, chat clients, terminals, and accessibility; inconsistent behavior slows users and causes costly mistakes in forms or chats.
  - Watch next: Standardize per‑app toggles (“Enter sends” vs “adds newline”), expose keypad Enter separately, and normalize line endings in tools by default.
