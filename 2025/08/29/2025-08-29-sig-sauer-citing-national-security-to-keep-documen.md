# Sig Sauer citing national security to keep documents from public

- Score: 291 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45063431) | Link: https://practicalshootinginsights.com/eighth-circuit-fmeca-update/

- TL;DR
    - An appeals fight over unsealing the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 pits transparency against “national security.” The Trace intervened to keep class‑certification records public, arguing the FMECA is already widely online via Practical Shooting Insights and isn’t protected under DoDI 5230.24. Sig urges deference to the Army and continued sealing. A second FMECA “memorandum” surfaced. Because the trial judge cited the FMECA repeatedly, access could shape scrutiny of P320 safety claims and the class action.

- Comment pulse
    - Investigate and halt P320s → ranges banning, alleged years-long knowledge, patented fix rebuffed; yet the Air Force cleared M18, and Congress likely balks over cost/politics.
    - PR fiasco → denial, lawsuits, attempted gagging; independent tests report unintended discharges; some demand recalls and executive penalties.
    - “Military secrets” claim doubted → civilian handgun is easily analyzed — counterpoint: a documented exploit could endanger troops and merit protection.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Courts favor openness for class-cert materials; after widespread publication, only targeted redactions—if any—are defensible.
    - Impact: A ruling limiting “military secrets” claims could constrain contractors’ sealing tactics and improve consumer safety disclosures across defense-adjacent products.
    - Watch next: Whether the FMECA memo is manufacturer-authored; Army’s formal position; any appellate guidance on DoDI 5230.24 versus court access rights.
