# Some users have noticed settings that let Meta analyze and retain phone photos

- Score: 535 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45062910) | Link: https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-might-be-secretly-scanning-your-phones-camera-roll-how-to-check-and-turn-it-off/

- TL;DR
  - Meta’s Facebook app includes “Camera roll sharing suggestions” and optional “cloud processing” that upload and analyze recent photos to generate AI collages/recaps. Meta says it’s opt-in and not for ads, but many users found the toggles on or don’t recall consenting; the test runs in US/Canada, excluding Illinois and Texas. ZDNET shows how to disable both; uploaded items reportedly delete after 30 days once turned off. HN wants OS-level controls and stricter app policies governing photo access.

- Comment pulse
  - Require OS photo-access/network audit logs → deters silent uploads; mirrors complaints about Windows Defender sending files without trails.
  - Make picker-only default; ban full-roll unless backup apps → reduces abuse; iOS/Android support limited access — counterpoint: some workflows legitimately need background indexing.
  - Meta’s tactics seen as exploitative → calls for regulation and boycotts; “golden handcuffs” and non-retroactive law blunt accountability.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Clear consent needs verifiable logs and reversible data flows, not one-time pop-ups.
  - Impact: Expect OS updates, App Store policies, and state privacy laws to constrain background media scanning.
  - Watch next: Independent audits, deletion verification APIs, and regulatory actions from FTC, EU DPAs, Texas/Illinois AGs.
