# The Synology End Game

- Score: 457 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45060920) | Link: https://lowendbox.com/blog/they-used-to-be-good-but-now-theyve-turned-to-evil-the-synology-end-game/

- TL;DR
  - A longtime Synology fan says the brand turned customer-hostile: artificial SMB connection caps and new models that accept only Synology-branded drives (with shorter warranties) push lock‑in. He’s considering TrueNAS or UGREEN. HN critiques focus on tech debt and security—ancient kernel, btrfs fork, missing WireGuard, flawed encryption—plus UX regressions and EOL pitfalls. Others counter Synology still “just works,” with unmatched integrated apps and low maintenance, while QNAP and emerging open x86 NAS boxes offer workable (if fussier) alternatives.

- Comment pulse
  - Synology’s stack is outdated and closed: old kernel/btrfs fork, weak encryption models, missing WireGuard; issues with arrays, sync, diagnostics.
  - Business shift to lock-in and upsell in a stagnating NAS market: growth pressure drives whitelists and artificial limits — counterpoint: many report years of stability.
  - Alternatives split users: QNAP, UGREEN boxes, Unraid/TrueNAS DIY offer flexibility; set-and-forget convenience, integrated apps, and low-power hardware remain hard to match.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Classic lock-in ratchet—artificial limits and drive whitelists trade goodwill for short-term revenue.
  - Impact: Prosumer NAS buyers face higher TCO; SMBs reconsider QNAP/UGREEN/DIY; open-source NAS ecosystems gain mindshare.
  - Watch next: Firmware blocks, HDD_db workarounds, WireGuard support, UGREEN/Minisforum releases, and any EU interoperability/right-to-repair actions.
