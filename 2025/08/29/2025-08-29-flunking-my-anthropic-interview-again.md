# Flunking my Anthropic interview again

- Score: 370 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45064284) | Link: https://taylor.town/flunking-anthropic

- TL;DR
    - The author recounts failing Anthropic’s DevRel interview despite a strong referral, completing a secret take‑home, and launching an unsolicited Claude-positive project that hit HN—then getting the rejection. They process the sting, worry about “weirdness” and over-sharing, and recommit to growth and optimism. HN replies emphasize that rejections often carry little signal; hiring is subjective and varies widely by metric. Debate flares over public vulnerability versus employer perceptions, and over AI interviews’ intensity and luck. Consensus: don’t pin identity or purpose on one company.

- Comment pulse
    - Rejections carry no signal → multiple good applicants, subjective “fit”, logistics; you can pass and still lose — counterpoint: bias (e.g., ageism) can make rejection personal.
    - Public self-disclosure risks employability → permanent records shape perception; better reveal quirks organically — counterpoint: audience-building is marketable; authenticity beats pretending for bad matches.
    - AI interviews are extreme and inconsistent → companies optimize different metrics; output-heavy take-homes abound; luck and question selection matter; don’t tether self-worth to one loop.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat hiring as stochastic filtering; diversify applications, time-box take-homes, and iterate based on mock-interview feedback.
    - Impact: Public artifacts compound options: roles in DevRel, consulting, or creator monetization even if flagship companies pass.
    - Watch next: At AI labs, watch for clearer feedback policies, humane take-home scopes, and standardized evaluation rubrics across teams.
