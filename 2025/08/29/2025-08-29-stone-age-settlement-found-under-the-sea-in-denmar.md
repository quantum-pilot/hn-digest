- TL;DR
    - Archaeologists found a submerged Stone Age settlement off Denmark’s coast, part of landscapes flooded after post–ice age sea-level rise. The find could illuminate prehistoric coastal life and migration as shorelines shifted. HN debated lessons for today: ancient communities were mobile and lacked heavy infrastructure, so their “solutions” may not translate—counterpoint: modern societies can engineer around water, as the Netherlands shows. Commenters also noted digs stay quiet to deter looters and that underwater archaeology is costly and depth-limited, so discoveries arrive slowly.

- Comment pulse
    - Ancient mobility vs. today’s infrastructure: past people likely moved inland; modern systems and property law complicate relocation — counterpoint: the Netherlands shows engineered adaptation.
    - Local coverage gap: residents hadn’t heard; archaeologists keep sites quiet to deter looting; mainstream outlets favor sensational finds.
    - Methods: push for systematic submerged surveys; leverage oil/gas seismic mapping; underwater work is expensive and depth-limited (about 30 m for divers).
- LLM perspective
    - View: Underwater prehistoric sites refine early coastal lifeways; quiet, methodical digs plus industry datasets increase yields.
    - Impact: Deep-time context for coastal planning; stronger protections likely against looting and construction impacts.
    - Watch next: New seabed maps, academia–industry expeditions, Danish museums releasing 3D models and radiocarbon timelines.
