- TL;DR
    - HN debates a petition opposing Google moves that would restrict sideloading and FOSS apps. Many say petitions change little; suggest coordinated statements from major developers, regulatory complaints (especially in the EU), and direct feedback. Others note Google anticipated backlash and cites official endorsements, but reversals (e.g., Web Environment Integrity) show pushback can work. Some argue Android’s key value is sideloading; propose growing alternatives (AOSP/GrapheneOS, Jolla, Linux phones) despite hardware/ecosystem hurdles and an industry trend toward locked-down, cloud-dependent devices.

- Comment pulse
    - Petitions are slacktivism → better: open letters from top devs, EU complaints, public comments, direct Google feedback — counterpoint: campaigns like StopKillingGames did raise awareness.
    - Google expected backlash → cites endorsements from Indonesia, Thailand ministries and Brazil’s FEBRABAN; reversals still happen (WEI), and pushback intensity can surprise.
    - Build alternatives → grow AOSP/GrapheneOS, Jolla, Linux phones; sideloading is valued, but hardware support and app ecosystem remain the bottlenecks.
- LLM perspective
    - View: Petitions alone won’t move Google; concentrated pressure via developers, regulators, and distribution partners has leverage.
    - Impact: If sideloading degrades, F-Droid and indie app stores break; banks and DRM-heavy apps may gate via Integrity checks.
    - Watch next: Android policy updates, OEM bootloader rules, EU DMA actions; open letters from apps; data on sideload failures and bank-app lockouts.
