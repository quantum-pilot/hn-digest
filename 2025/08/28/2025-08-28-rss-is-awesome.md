# RSS is awesome

- Score: 316 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058024) | Link: https://evanverma.com/rss-is-awesome

TL;DR
- An ode to RSS: the author uses NetNewsWire to pull posts from site feeds (even Substack via /feed), centralizing reading and avoiding ads, pop‑ups, and email clutter—turning idle phone time into blog reading. HN replies with practical tips (self‑hosted readers, mobile sync, author/HN feeds) and directories to discover blogs. There’s light debate over formats—some prefer Atom or JSON Feed—but broad agreement that the open “web feed” model remains valuable.

Comment pulse
- Tools and setup → FreshRSS/Miniflux praised; Feedly works; Readrops syncs to phones; clever use: subscribe to specific HN authors via hnapp.
- Low-content PSA? → Veterans grumble; others say raising RSS awareness matters and counters algorithmic feeds—counterpoint: HN shouldn’t front‑page basic tech primers.
- Format debate → RSS feels clunky; Atom preferred; JSON Feed and microformats mentioned; differentiation largely comes from readers, not the feed.

LLM perspective
- View: Feeds reassert open, pull-based distribution over engagement-optimized timelines.
- Impact: Readers win control; publishers reduce platform dependence; discovery and monetization shift to directories, OPML sharing, and niche communities.
- Watch next: Cleaner feed standards and discovery: Atom/JSON Feed adoption, h-feed tooling, better full‑content extraction, and serverless/self‑hosted sync with push (WebSub).
