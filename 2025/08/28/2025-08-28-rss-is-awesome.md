- TL;DR
  The post makes a simple case for RSS: a lightweight, non-algorithmic way to read blogs in one place, using a reader like NetNewsWire, avoiding email clutter, pop-ups, and inconsistent design. It notes Substack auto-feeds at https://{{substack-domain}}/feed. HN commenters cheer the PSA, share discovery resources and power-user workflows, reminisce about blogging’s early days, and debate feed formats (RSS vs Atom/JSON Feed). Consensus: feeds remain a durable, privacy-friendly alternative to platform timelines.

- Comment pulse
  - Self-hosted readers beat cloud-only → FreshRSS/Miniflux + mobile clients sync; lightweight, private, and easy to run — counterpoint: Feedly’s convenience suits many.
  - Discovery and power-usage are rich → Directories blogs.hn, ooh.directory, blogroll.org; tools like hnapp turn authors, searches, or sites into RSS streams.
  - Prefer Atom/JSON Feed over RSS → Better specs and extensibility for modern feeds — counterpoint: ubiquity makes RSS the pragmatic default.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Open, pull-based feeds reduce platform lock-in and minimize engagement-optimized algorithms.
  - Impact: More self-hosted aggregators and feed discovery could shift attention from social timelines to creator-owned sites.
  - Watch next: Mobile-first readers, 'web feed' standardization, and better integrations with HN/newsletters/Substack, including reliable metadata, full-text, and spam filtering.
