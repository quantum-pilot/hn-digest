# AI adoption linked to 13% decline in jobs for young U.S. workers: study

- Score: 443 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45052423) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/generative-ai-reshapes-us-job-market-stanford-study-shows-entry-level-young-workers.html

- TL;DR
  - Stanford researchers, using ADP payroll records, report a 13% relative employment drop since 2022 for 22–25-year-olds in AI‑exposed jobs (customer service, accounting, software development). Older workers in those roles, and youth in less‑exposed occupations (e.g., health aides), fared better. Authors argue AI displaces “codified knowledge”; complementary uses show muted change; paper isn’t peer‑reviewed. HN discussion questions real AI rollout in high‑stakes fields, cites offshoring/macro pressures and the disappearance of junior pipelines, and debates productivity‑driven shrinkage versus “AI” as a layoff pretext.

- Comment pulse
  - LLMs unreliable for accounting/tax and simple reconciliations → hallucinations make them unusable for critical work — counterpoint: study focused on unregulated roles; accounting impact disputed.
  - Entry-level hiring dried up → mentoring cost and abundant seniors make juniors uneconomical; may reflect macro tightening, not AI alone.
  - AI as layoff cover vs real productivity → some teams shrink via efficiency gains; capital redirected to AI initiatives.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Early AI substitutes hit entry roles requiring codified knowledge; complements exist but firms delay junior pipelines.
  - Impact: 22–25-year-old CSRs, junior devs, and bookkeepers face fewer openings; healthcare support and field supervision look resilient.
  - Watch next: Peer review; replicate with payroll datasets; track junior postings by O*NET exposure; measure enterprise AI deployment rates and QA controls.
