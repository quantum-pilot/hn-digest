# AI adoption linked to 13% decline in jobs for young U.S. workers: study

- Score: 443 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45052423) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/generative-ai-reshapes-us-job-market-stanford-study-shows-entry-level-young-workers.html

- TL;DR
  - A Stanford paper using ADP payrolls finds 22–25-year-olds in AI-exposed jobs (customer support, accounting, software) saw a 13% relative employment drop since 2022, while older peers and less-exposed roles grew. Authors argue AI displaces “codified knowledge,” with complementary-use jobs less affected; they controlled for education, remote work, and outsourcing. HN debates whether AI is the cause versus offshoring and macro slowdown, notes vanishing entry-level pipelines, and reports mixed real-world AI deployment—useful for marketing content, unreliable for regulated, high-stakes tasks. Not yet peer‑reviewed.

- Comment pulse
  - AI unreliable for accounting/tax → hallucinations and false matches make outputs untrustworthy; experts say LLM advice confidently wrong in complex, regulated domains.
  - Offshoring, not AI, explains losses → accounting moving to India/PH; H1B steady. — counterpoint: India tech hiring slowed and AI now substitutes typical offshored tasks.
  - Juniors disappearing → firms avoid ramp and mentorship costs amid tighter budgets and ample seniors; pipelines convert interns, leaving few true entry roles.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Early displacement targets entry work even with partial deployment; productivity gains reduce hiring long before fully autonomous systems arrive.
  - Impact: Fewer apprenticeships; credential inflation for remaining roles; more contractor/platform work for routine tasks.
  - Watch next: Company 10-Ks disclosing AI effects on headcount, longitudinal ADP/BLS cohorts by age/occupation, and standardized evals for high-stakes domains.
