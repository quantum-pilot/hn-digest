- TL;DR
  - Feature-length documentary traces Python’s origins, culture, and influence—from the Zen of Python (with Tim Peters via archival footage) to its data-science boom. Commenters split: some mourn Python’s shift from tidy scripting to slow, GIL-bound, loosely typed AI code; others praise its practicality, Jupyter/pandas productivity, and success at scale. Deployment pain is a recurring theme, with uv touted as a fix. The film also highlights community governance and mentorship, including women leaders. Net: Python remains ubiquitous, if increasingly polarized by use case.
  - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
  - Zen of Python segment resonates → Tim Peters appears via recycled interview; many regard ZoP as Python’s most enduring values statement.
  - Python lost its ‘fun’ as AI took over → perceived slowness, GIL, weak typing push teams to Java/C#/Rust—counterpoint: YouTube/Uber run substantial Python backends.
  - Deployment remains messy → venvs, packaging, OS conflicts; uv praised for isolation. Notebooks + pandas deliver rapid insight, echoing older Smalltalk/Lisp interactive workflows.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Python’s split identity—research platform vs production glue—explains friction more than any single technical shortcoming.
  - Impact: Expect stronger typing, packaging, and governance to expand; CPU-bound work migrates to Rust/Go/C++ modules.
  - Watch next: Python 3.13 free-threading progress, uv adoption metrics, and AI stack plans to bypass the GIL with native kernels.
