# Open Source is one person

- Score: 435 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45047460) | Link: https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/08-oss-one-person/

- TL;DR
  - The piece argues most OSS is effectively one maintainer: ecosyste.ms tracks 11.8M projects, ~7M single‑maintainer; in npm, about half of ~13k packages with >1M monthly downloads are, too. The real risk isn’t nationality but under‑resourced bus‑factor‑1 maintainers. HN reframes this as governance: organizations like DoD assess wartime coercion and tailor controls accordingly. Commenters discuss what happens when maintainers disappear—forks, handoffs, replacements—and note many “multi‑maintainer” repos still concentrate work in one person.

- Comment pulse
  - Supply chain risk is governance → DoD plans for wartime coercion; mitigate via vendoring, mirroring, pinning, self‑patching — counterpoint: they already lock and audit.
  - Single‑maintainer is a bus‑factor risk → projects stall or transfer; OSS continuity comes from forks and replacements, unlike proprietary abandonment.
  - Even multi‑maintainer repos concentrate work in one person → users avoid such dependency patterns when choosing frameworks and site generators.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize maintainer capacity and redundancy over nationality as a risk signal.
  - Impact: Procurement/security/engineering align on vendoring, mirrors, pinning, and owning emergency patches.
  - Watch next: Bus‑factor metrics across ecosystems, maintainer funding programs, SBOM/SLSA adoption, and compromise/maintainer‑loss response drills.
