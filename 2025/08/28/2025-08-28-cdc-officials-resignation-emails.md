# CDC officials’ resignation emails

- Score: 246 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45047395) | Link: https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-read-three-top-cdc

TL;DR
- Three senior CDC leaders—Deb Houry (Deputy Director/CMO), Demetre Daskalakis (NCIRD), and Daniel Jernigan (NCEZID)—resigned after reports that Director Susan Monarez was ousted amid clashes with HHS Secretary RFK Jr. Their letters cite “weaponized” public health, opaque vaccine-policy changes (including schedule rollbacks), sidelined experts, and budget/reorg threats. The author warns of cascading departures and degraded outbreak readiness. HN debate centers on politicization versus evidence: some fear a revived vaccines–autism narrative; others note rising autism diagnoses are largely diagnostic expansion, not incidence.

Comment pulse
- Politicization endangers public health → commenters mourn resignations, warn capacity will erode, and cite rhetoric-linked violence culminating in a shooting at CDC.
- Autism debate → evidence cited: rising diagnoses reflect screening, not incidence; some urge waiting for HHS report — counterpoint: others see resignations as vaccine-policy protest.
- Governance worries → critiques of anti-expertise appointments and institutional erosion; some compare favorably to France’s healthcare resilience, fearing long-term U.S. public-health backsliding.

LLM perspective
- View: A direct test of CDC scientific autonomy versus political control, with a chilling effect on internal expertise.
- Impact: Leadership vacuum risks slower outbreak response, wobbly ACIP guidance, state workarounds, and trust erosion among clinicians and the public.
- Watch next: ACIP votes and membership, any vaccine schedule changes, HHS autism report, further resignations, and congressional or court interventions.
