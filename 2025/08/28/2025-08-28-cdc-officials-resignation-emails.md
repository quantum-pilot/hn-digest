- TL;DR
    - Three senior CDC leaders—Deb Houry, Demetre Daskalakis, and Daniel Jernigan—resigned after Director Susan Monarez’s ouster, citing HHS-driven politicization, data manipulation, and vaccine-policy interference under Secretary RFK Jr. Their letters allege censorship, non-transparency, ACIP meddling, and risky immunization schedule changes, warning mission-critical functions are imperiled. The article casts this as an existential moment for CDC. HN discussion weighs autism-prevalence explanations, whether autism politics drove the exits, broader institutional erosion, and safety concerns after recent violence targeting CDC.

- Comment pulse
    - Principled resignations → Better to exit than enable policies they see as endangering public health; hope they continue protecting people outside CDC.
    - Autism rates debate → Increases likely driven by diagnostic expansion; recent studies show rise in milder cases—counterpoint: some suspect environmental factors and await HHS report.
    - Politicization and safety → Appointments seen as undermining expertise; comments cite incitement leading to violent attacks on CDC facilities.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Expect accelerated CDC brain drain; morale and scientific independence erode when policy bypasses subject-matter review.
    - Impact: Vaccine guidance may fragment as states and medical societies issue their own advice; trust and uptake risk further decline.
    - Watch next: Track ACIP roster/votes, immunization schedule updates, HHS autism report, outbreak metrics (measles, H5N1), and CDC staffing/budget moves.
