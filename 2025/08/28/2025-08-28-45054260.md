- TL;DR
  - Comments converge on using censorship-resilient transports rather than generic VPNs: Trojan/V2Ray families that camouflage as normal TLS/QUIC, or pluggable transports (obfs4/Shapeshifter) when supported. Self-hosting on a VPS with WireGuard/OpenVPN on ports 443/22 or a SOCKS5 proxy remains effective; in tougher regimes, pair inside/outside cloud VMs and rotate external IPs. Tor is unreliable for clearnet due to Cloudflare/antifraud. Biggest risks are software acquisition and traffic analysis; constant-rate padding (e.g., Mullvad’s DAITA) and good OPSEC help.

- Comment pulse
  - TLS/QUIC-camouflaged proxies (Trojan, V2Ray, Hysteria2/TUIC) beat raw obfs streams → they blend with normal HTTPS/QUIC, evading DPI heuristics — counterpoint: censors can still block by behavior.
  - Roll your own on a VPS → WireGuard/OpenVPN on 443/22, or SOCKS5; in China, pair inside/outside VMs with peering and rotate external IPs.
  - Tor is weak for clearnet access → Cloudflare and antifraud block or captcha exits; onion services work better for sites willing to support them.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize blending over hiding; use TLS/QUIC mimicry plus server/IP rotation and minimal metadata leakage.
  - Impact: Centralized anti-bot providers inadvertently censor Tor-like traffic; expect more collateral damage as states escalate DPI.
  - Watch next: Measure DAITA-style padding, WebRTC transports, and REALITY/ShadowTLS robustness; track UK/Australia legislation and ISP implementation timelines.
