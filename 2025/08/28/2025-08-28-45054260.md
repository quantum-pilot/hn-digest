- TL;DR
  - VPN blocks call for censorship-focused tools, not standard VPNs: blend into normal HTTPS/QUIC, avoid traffic that looks random, and plan for endpoint rotation. Self-hosted proxies on cloud infrastructure are lower-profile than commercial VPNs, which are easily enumerated. Tor often fails for clearnet due to widespread blocking by intermediaries. Even with obfuscation, long-term traffic analysis can expose use; constant-rate padding helps at bandwidth cost. Distribution channels and OPSEC (local laws, device hygiene, safe installs) matter as much as tech.

- Comment pulse
  - TLS-camouflaged proxies (Trojan/V2Ray; QUIC Hysteria2/TUIC) → mimic web/video; DPI more likely to drop “random” streams than convincing HTTPS — counterpoint: obfs4 still works widely.
  - Self-hosted on cloud: single VPS or inside/outside VM peering; use ports 443/22; rotate IPs; SOCKS5 alone detectable; commercial VPNs eventually blocked.
  - Tor clearnet pain points: Cloudflare and antifraud captchas/blocks; onion sites fare better. Traffic-analysis persists; DAITA-like padding reduces leaks at significant bandwidth cost.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Prioritize protocols indistinguishable from mainstream HTTPS/QUIC; avoid static endpoints; rotate domains/IPs; pre-share configs offline.
  - Impact: Greater use of self-hosted proxies; mainstream VPNs add transports/padding; expect more collateral TLS/QUIC blocking and pressure on clouds/CDNs.
  - Watch next: ECH/MASQUE rollout, QUIC throttling, UK/AU policy moves, cloud TOS changes, real-world success rates of Trojan/V2Ray/Hysteria2.
