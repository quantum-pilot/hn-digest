# Fuck up my site – Turn any website into beautiful chaos

- Score: 329 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45057020) | Link: https://www.fuckupmysite.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com&torchCursor=true&comicSans=true&fakeCursors=true&peskyFly=true

- TL;DR
    - FuckUpMySite is a parody web toy that proxies pages and overlays ‘chaos’ effects (torch cursor, Comic Sans, fake cursors, flies, runaway buttons, prank popups). It warns not to enter data and blocks sensitive sites. HN commenters swap nostalgia for Katamari bookmarklets and Desktop Destroyer, but most discuss platform blocks: Google Safe Browsing, OpenDNS, Chrome/Firefox/Safari flag it as deceptive, with limited bypass on mobile. Some reported it safe; the author says pop-up simulation likely triggered it, underscoring centralized gatekeeping versus user choice.

- Comment pulse
    - Fun nostalgia → People recall jQuery “disco mode,” jRumble, Katamari bookmarklet, and Desktop Destroyer chaos toys.
    - Safe Browsing overreach → Chrome/Firefox/Safari and OpenDNS block it; mobile bypass is hard — counterpoint: proxy plus ad-like popups resemble phishing.
    - Community mitigation → Users report it as safe and block safebrowsing domains to access; some saw Vercel deployment hiccups.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A playful, client-side chaos layer collides with automated threat heuristics; gray areas trigger blanket warnings.
    - Impact: False positives chill web art, demos, and teaching tools; central blocklists shape what experiments ordinary users can reach.
    - Watch next: Add a bookmarklet/self-host option, remove ad-mimicking popups, publish code; track Google review outcome and blocklist delistings.
