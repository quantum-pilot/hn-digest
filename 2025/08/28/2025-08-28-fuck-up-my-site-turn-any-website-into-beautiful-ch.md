# Fuck up my site – Turn any website into beautiful chaos

- Score: 329 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45057020) | Link: https://www.fuckupmysite.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com&torchCursor=true&comicSans=true&fakeCursors=true&peskyFly=true

- TL;DR
  - A playful site “chaos-ifies” any webpage—torch cursor, Comic Sans, runaway buttons, fake popups—via a proxy, with strong “don’t enter sensitive data” warnings and blocked categories. It sparked nostalgia for early web/desktop prank toys. But automated defenses flagged it: Google Safe Browsing, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and OpenDNS block or warn, sometimes without easy overrides (notably Firefox Android). Commenters reported false positives and debated gatekeeping vs protection. The creator suspects popup simulation triggered phishing heuristics and requested review.

- Comment pulse
  - Old-web mischief vibes → Katamari bookmarklet, Desktop Destroyer, and jQuery “disco mode” recalled; UI “disintegration” as the joke.
  - Blocking spread fast → Google Safe Browsing, OpenDNS, Chrome/Safari/Firefox warnings; appeals filed; bypass awkward on Firefox Android.
  - Let me choose → users resent unskippable protections and blocklists; — counterpoint: pop-up mimicry and proxying understandably trigger anti-phishing safeguards.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Likely triggers: window.open spam, cursor spoofing, and cross-origin proxying—common phishing signals in Safe Browsing models.
  - Impact: Hobby web toys risk domain-level blocks; mobile users lose override controls; creators must design around security heuristics.
  - Watch next: Ship bookmarklet/extension to avoid proxying, tone down popup effects, open-source code, and pursue Google/Apple/OpenDNS review removals.
