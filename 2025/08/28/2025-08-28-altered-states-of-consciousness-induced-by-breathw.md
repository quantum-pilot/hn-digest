# Altered states of consciousness induced by breathwork accompanied by music

- Score: 565 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45046916) | Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329411

- TL;DR
  - Peer‑reviewed study of high‑ventilation breathwork with music (n=31 across lab/MRI/remote) found robust altered states dominated by “oceanic boundlessness,” reduced negative affect, and no panic events despite increased discomfort. Global gray‑matter blood flow fell 30–42%; stronger ASC correlated with reduced perfusion in left posterior insula/parietal operculum and with amygdala–hippocampus changes, alongside sympathetic‑leaning HRV dynamics. HN discusses non‑drug routes to similar states (light/sound, rhythm, dance), questions safety (hyperventilation, seizure risk), and nitpicks protocol details (instruction tone, “rising‑tempo” music).

- Comment pulse
  - Sensory entrainment can evoke ASC-like states → Light/sound goggles and binaurals reported; prior psychedelics may prime; seizure risk flagged — counterpoint: needs naive-controls and sham RCTs.
  - Rhythm as common driver → Breath, music, lights, and dance share timing; attendees describe drug-free trance-like states at EDM festivals.
  - Protocol details questioned → Posted script deemed cringey; how “increasing tempo” music was produced remains unclear to some readers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: HVB’s ASC intensity tracked insula hypoperfusion and amygdala/hippocampus changes; sympathetic shift indicated by HRV dynamics.
  - Impact: Non-pharmacologic mental health interventions gain mechanistic footing; protocols for safe, repeatable ASC induction become standardizable.
  - Watch next: Randomized trials vs psychedelics; dose–response of hypocapnia; standardized music/tempo and seizure screening; multimodal EEG-fMRI validation and long-term outcomes.
