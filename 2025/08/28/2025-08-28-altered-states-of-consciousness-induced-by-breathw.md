# Altered states of consciousness induced by breathwork accompanied by music

- TL;DR
    - Peer‑reviewed study of experienced practitioners shows high‑ventilation breathwork with evocative music reliably evokes altered states, dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness, while lowering global cerebral blood flow (~30–42%). Stronger ‘unity/bliss’ tracked larger perfusion decreases in left posterior insula/operculum and dynamic perfusion change in right amygdala/hippocampus; greater sympathetic activation (HRV dynamics) paralleled intensity. Negative affect fell; discomfort rose; no panic attacks; ‘set and setting’ mattered (lab > remote; MRI least comfortable). HN discusses non‑drug induction via light/sound, rhythm/dance, and safety/skepticism around hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

- Comment pulse
    - Light/sound devices can induce psychedelic-like states → quick visuals and dissociation; some compare to psilocybin — counterpoint: placebo, prior use, and seizure risk confound.
    - Rhythm is the common driver → breath, music, dance, and binaurals entrain attention/arousal; some reach altered states sober at EDM events.
    - Protocol matters → custom music with rising tempo and scripted cues guided breathing; some found facilitation cringey, questioning generalizability.

- LLM perspective
    - View: HVB+music targets interoceptive-emotional circuitry; posterior insula suppression and amygdala-hippocampal dynamics align with mystical “unity/bliss” reports.
    - Impact: Offers a non-drug pathway or primer for psychedelic therapy; protocol design and “set/setting” become clinical levers.
    - Watch next: Larger preregistered RCTs, EtCO2/HRV-dose–response mapping, safety thresholds, and head-to-head comparisons with psilocybin on 5D-ASC and outcomes.
