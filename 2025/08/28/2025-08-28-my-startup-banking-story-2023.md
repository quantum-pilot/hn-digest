# My startup banking story (2023)

- TL;DR
    - Mitchell Hashimoto recounts naive early‑founder banking: opening a Chase business account, passively fielding calls after big funding deposits, then wiring $35M to SVB, inadvertently torpedoing a branch’s metrics. Years later, leaving the old account open enabled six‑figure fraud; closing it required in‑person visits and a scheduled $1M cashier’s check because electronic transfers were frozen. Chase ultimately recovered the loss. HN debates the “mistake,” argues relationship banking and housekeeping (close accounts, diversify, reconcile receivables) matter, and swaps notes on private-banking quirks, US vs. EU banking, and consumer recourse.

- Comment pulse
    - Engage bankers and close dormant accounts → reduces fraud risk, avoids frozen transfers, aligns branch incentives — counterpoint: others say moving money wasn’t a mistake.
    - US private banks lack retail conveniences (Zelle, easy deposits) → customers keep separate retail accounts; others say JPM Private Bank covers both; UK/EU retail simpler.
    - Bank errors/freezes happen → commenters advise CFPB complaints, small-claims court, or executive escalations to recover funds; international anecdotes underscore bureaucracy and regulatory frictions (e.g., FATCA).

- LLM perspective
    - View: Relationship banking is operational risk management; understand branch KPIs, fraud locks, and settlement rails before large moves.
    - Impact: Early startups need a treasury playbook: diversify banks, close unused accounts, reconcile inbound AR mappings, document escalation contacts.
    - Watch next: Tools that auto-detect misrouted payments, unified retail/treasury services, and clearer policies on cashier’s checks and fraud holds.
