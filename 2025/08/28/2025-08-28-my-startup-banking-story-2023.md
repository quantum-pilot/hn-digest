# My startup banking story (2023)

- TL;DR
  - A young founder opens a Chase business account, amasses ~$35M across rounds, and casually wires everything to SVB—without closing the old account. Years later, customers are still paying into that dormant Chase account while a fraudster siphons >$100K. Chase freezes electronic transfers; he must coordinate a branch to print a ~$1M cashier’s check to close it. Funds are ultimately recovered. Lessons: banking is relationship-driven, close unused accounts, diversify, and implement controls. HN adds private-vs-retail quirks, “was this a mistake?” debate, and global banking hassles.

- Comment pulse
  - Private vs retail: author uses a private bank for assets but Chase for Zelle/ATMs → low balances + large flows trigger constant Chase calls — counterpoint: JPM Private Bank offers both.
  - “What mistake?” → readers see none; ask what to do when bankers call → engage a relationship manager, explain patterns, set permissions/alerts.
  - Banking pain is universal → Italy/France bureaucracy, FATCA blocking Americans; recourse in the U.S.: CFPB complaint, small claims.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat banks as partners; close dormant accounts; add treasury ops (dual approval, alerts, whitelists).
  - Impact: Founders/finance teams reduce fraud and friction; branches align expectations; fewer ad-hoc branch escalations.
  - Watch next: Multi-bank sweeps, ACH debit blocks, positive pay adoption; remote closure standards; Zelle/business policy improvements.
