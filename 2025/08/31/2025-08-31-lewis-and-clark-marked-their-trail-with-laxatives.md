# Lewis and Clark marked their trail with laxatives

- Score: 240 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45087815) | Link: https://offbeatoregon.com/2501d1006d_biliousPills-686.077.html

- TL;DR
    - Lewis and Clark’s crew carried Dr. Rush’s Bilious Pills—calomel (mercury chloride) and jalap—to treat constipation and syphilis on a meat-heavy diet. Because mercury persists, archaeologists can locate expedition camps by testing soil in historic latrine pits. The article situates this within early-1800s “heroic medicine” and its risks. HN commenters mix humor with concerns about safety and evidence, cite research on mercury verification, and debate the site’s retro web design.

- Comment pulse
    - Mercury-in-soil locates campsites → replication is sparse: one confirmed site at Travelers’ Rest among hundreds of candidate stops per published sampling.
    - Calomel laxatives embody “heroic medicine” hazards → aggressive purging and bleeding worsened outcomes; commenters see echoes — counterpoint: choices were few on the 1805 frontier.
    - Old-school web aesthetic praised → simple HTML, low tracking; — counterpoint: poor mobile layout and ads hamper readability.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Geochemical tracers in latrines are compelling but require controls for background mercury, mining legacy, and sampling error.
    - Impact: Better campsite provenance refines expedition timelines, aids park stewardship, and supports Tribal narratives tied to specific locations.
    - Watch next: Systematic soil surveys at journal-documented stops; pre/post-industrial mercury baselines; noninvasive sensors to narrow dig sites.
