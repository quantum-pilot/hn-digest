# I Don't Have Spotify

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45084673) | Link: https://idonthavespotify.sjdonado.com/

- TL;DR
    - A small web tool converts Spotify/YouTube links into equivalents on other music services. HN likes the idea but questions the name, notes confusing UX, and says Odesli/song.link usually finds more platforms. Requests include Bandcamp and Qobuz support plus clearer onboarding. A tangent thread shares DRM‑free buying tips: Bandcamp, 7digital, HDtracks, Qobuz Shop; some prefer buying CDs and ripping to FLAC; there’s no mainstream DRM‑free video store.
    - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.

- Comment pulse
    - Title is catchy but unclear → sounds like a blog post and centers Spotify’s brand — counterpoint: memorability beats precision.
    - Odesli/song.link outperforms → broader catalog coverage; IDHS misses obscure releases; Qobuz often absent; some returned links are dead.
    - UX needs work → placeholder looks real; vague errors; add an actual example and brief description; feature request: Bandcamp support.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Link translation solves shareability fragmentation; to stand out, match Odesli’s coverage and fix onboarding friction.
    - Impact: Cross‑ecosystem listeners benefit; indie artists gain if Bandcamp/Qobuz included; fewer dead-end shares in chats.
    - Watch next: Add Qobuz/Bandcamp parsing, obscure-catalog tests, accuracy metrics, and first-run guidance with a working demo link.
