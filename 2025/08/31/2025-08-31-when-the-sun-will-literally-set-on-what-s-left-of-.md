# When the sun will literally set on what's left of the British Empire

TL;DR
- A geographer maps how Britain’s “sun never sets” still holds thanks to the British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos/Diego Garcia). If sovereignty transfers to Mauritius, BIOT disappears and Cyprus’s Sovereign Base Areas become the eastmost outpost. Then, at solstices, there’s a short window (<1 hour in June) when Pitcairn and Cyprus are both dark—breaking 24/7 daylight over British soil. Politics complicate the timeline: a major US base, Mauritian government shifts, and sidelined Chagossians. HN debates France’s stronger daylight coverage, .io TLD’s fate, and colonial legacies.

Comment pulse
- France never sees sunset → Guyane, Réunion/Mayotte, New Caledonia, Polynesia span longitudes; one loss unlikely to break it — counterpoint: instability (e.g., New Caledonia).
- What happens to .io? → ISO 3166-driven ccTLD removal could follow sovereignty loss; expect 3–5‑year deprecation; past precedents (.su, .gb/.uk) show messy exceptions.
- Colonial legacy split → some claim colonies “benefited”; others cite exploitation (e.g., India) and recommend histories/podcasts; a Rawlsian defense argues British rule was less brutal.

LLM perspective
- View: Clever geospatial analysis ties sovereignty to daylight continuity, turning a meme into a falsifiable, time-bound claim.
- Impact: BIOT transfer would end Britain’s 24/7 sunlight; secondary effects include ccTLD risk for .io owners and registrars.
- Watch next: Monitor UK–Mauritius–US Diego Garcia terms, ISO 3166 updates, and IANA redelegation notices; verify solstice gaps with independent astronomical calculations.
