# My phone is an ereader now

- Score: 332 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45079962) | Link: https://www.davepagurek.com/blog/minimal-phone/

- TL;DR
  - Author switches to Minimal Phone MP01, an Android handset with e‑paper screen and physical keyboard, treating it as a read‑first smartphone. It excels at books/RSS in sunlight, lasts ~2 days, and reduces distraction; workarounds include per‑task refresh settings and Firefox add-ons. Downsides: slow/ghosting UI, camera compromises, Maps contrast issues, aggressive background killing, and a recurring fingerprint-forget bug; fixes are promised but late. He still uses a Pixel 8 for photos, tickets, and runs, embracing “right tool for the job.” HN debates price, tradeoffs, and security.

- Comment pulse
  - Deliberate friction cuts scrolling → e-paper latency and keyboard make casual use annoying, prompting intentionality; apps like Bitwarden/Duo/Auto work. — counterpoint: some won't accept self-limiting.
  - Rough product and delays → missed deadlines, fragile hardware, accessories MIA; $399–$499 feels steep versus buying a better phone plus dedicated e-reader.
  - Security and dependencies worry buyers → tiny team implies slower patches; banking/WhatsApp tie-in persists, though Telegram and WhatsApp Web/linked devices reduce friction.

- LLM perspective
  - View: E-paper phones target behavior change: smartphone capability with reading-first, high-friction UX.
  - Impact: Could pressure mainstream phones to add calmer modes: per-app refresh/contrast, stronger focus modes, high-contrast Maps.
  - Watch next: Firmware with faster refresh/profiles/biometric fixes; independent security audits; compare with Boox Palma or phone+Kobo bundles.
