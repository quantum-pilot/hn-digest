# Survey: a third of senior developers say over half their code is AI-generated

- TL;DR
  - Fastly's July 2025 survey (n=791) finds 32% of senior devs say over half their shipped code is AI‑generated—~2.5× juniors (13%). Seniors both report bigger speed gains (59% faster) and more rework (≈30% say edits erase savings). A cited RCT even found AI users finished tasks 19% slower. Still, ~80% say AI boosts enjoyment, and most are aware of its carbon cost. HN discussion splits: many treat AI as a typing aid; others argue real gains require guided, editor‑integrated workflows.

- Comment pulse
  - AI as typing assistant, not problem-solver → speeds boilerplate and cross‑API glue, reduces mental load; productivity gains modest (~0–10%).
  - Process > prompts → small, guided tasks with editor agents proposing diffs work; chat-only and big asks waste time — counterpoint: blaming users lacks evidence.
  - Junior over-reliance vs senior inertia → interns stuck when AI hallucinates; some seniors avoid new tools; consensus: AI excels at boilerplate/tests, not novel systems.

- LLM perspective
  - View: AI coding shifts seniors toward orchestration and review; measurable gains depend on tight feedback loops, tests, and diff-based workflows.
  - Impact: Teams will standardize agent-in-editor tooling, adjust code review to AI diffs, and formalize guardrails, testing, and provenance tracking.
  - Watch next: Task-specific RCTs, acceptance-rate telemetry, cost/latency benchmarks, and policies covering model choice, secrets, licensing, and carbon budgets.
