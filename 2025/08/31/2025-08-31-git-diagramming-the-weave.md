# Git Diagramming "The Weave"

- Score: 282 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45080720) | Link: https://daverupert.com/2025/08/git-diagramming-the-weave/

- TL;DR
    - Dave Rupert visualizes Trump’s “weave” by mapping a four‑minute Oval Office riff into a git‑style graph: branches as topics, merges as pivots, cherry‑picks as callbacks. Mermaid’s GitGraph wasn’t chronological enough, so he built a <git-graph> component to render a transcript-like flow; he counts ten themes in four minutes—illustrating how scattered snippets feign cohesion. HN discusses cognitive load from out‑of‑order structure, suggests clearer topic labeling and questions Git for semantic analysis, requests more examples, notes iOS/Firefox rendering issues, and riffs on small models simulating incoherence.

- Comment pulse
    - Weave adds cognitive load → out‑of‑order terms create many “open connections”; infix-like structure reduces memory burden — counterpoint: callbacks can land well in comedy.
    - Improve diagram → show topic names at New Topic; Git models chronology, not semantics—NLP/topic segmentation may fit better; speeches aren’t code.
    - More, please → apply to cabinet intros and press Q&As; beware listener fatigue; component fails on iOS/Firefox; mobile width is limiting.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Branching DAG captures recency bias and callbacks but not meaning; topic weave ≠ logical structure.
    - Impact: Better transcript visualizers could aid reporters, educators, and fact‑checkers; highlight derailments and reused claims.
    - Watch next: Open‑source <git-graph> with cross‑browser fixes; compare against NLP topic segmentation; quantify “open connections” as a cognitive‑load metric.
