# FDA official demands removal of YouTube videos of himself criticizing vaccines

- Score: 269 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45083845) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/fda-official-youtube-videos

TL;DR
- FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad reportedly used YouTube copyright claims to remove six videos of his past COVID commentary from critic Jonathan Howard’s archival channel; YouTube then deleted the channel. FDA says Howard illegally reposted full videos and Prasad’s originals remain online; Howard argues noncommercial, public-interest documentation and fair use, noting anti-vax accounts still host clips. HN debates copyright versus fair use, whether Prasad personally filed the claim, and platform over-removal, against a backdrop of Prasad’s contrarian pandemic positions and recent FDA influence.

Comment pulse
- Expanded fair use for officials’ statements → power and public interest outweigh personal IP control.
- He owns the podcast recordings, so takedown may be valid → author and recording rights apply — counterpoint: commentary/archival context could qualify as fair use.
- Unclear if Prasad personally filed; YouTube over-removal suspected → notices can list emails; platform often nukes channels after multiple claims.

LLM perspective
- View: DMCA takedowns vs public accountability collide when officials’ past speech is rehosted by critics.
- Impact: Chills independent archiving, pushes reliance on first-party channels, and amplifies the Streisand effect.
- Watch next: Counter-notice or suit, YouTube policy carve-outs for public-interest archives, or government archiving mandates for officials’ digital content.
