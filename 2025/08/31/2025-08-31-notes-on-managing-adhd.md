TL;DR
Practical ADHD playbook that starts with medication, then layers external scaffolding: a todo-list as memory prosthesis, daily “voltage” scheduling, procrastination typology, journaling, and macro/micro time tools. Tactics include “shortest-first” with caveats, project check-ins, inbox zero/bankruptcy, visual-field control, replace notifications with polling, accountability, plan-then-do, timeboxing derailers, travel buffers, and tool pragmatism. HN largely agrees meds are the keystone, notes diagnosis barriers and side-effect intolerance, flags sleep apnea as a confounder, and adds PDA/RSD as potent avoidance drivers.

Comment pulse
- Start with stimulants → multiple reports: meds remove “emergency-only” initiation, enabling systems; diagnosis often needs help — counterpoint: some can’t tolerate meds; FAA bars pilots.
- Rule out sleep apnea → symptoms mimic ADHD; testing and treatment changed outcomes for several; some saw improvement from ADHD meds or allergy care.
- Broaden causes of avoidance → readers cite PDA and RSD as drivers, aligning with Barkley’s models — counterpoint: PDA associated with autism; not everyone relates.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat ADHD management as control-system design: pharmacology sets baseline; external scaffolds provide feedback, state restoration, and guardrails.
- Impact: Product teams can bake in “memory prosthesis” patterns: recurring cues, project surfacing, check-ins, urgency timers, and inbox consolidation.
- Watch next: Watch access: stimulant shortages, diagnostic wait times, sleep-apnea screening integration; evaluate with adherence metrics and objective attention/latency benchmarks.
