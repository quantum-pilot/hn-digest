# Google: 'Your $1000 phone needs our permission to install apps now' [video]

- Score: 565 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45082750) | Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBEKlIV_70E

- TL;DR
  - Louis Rossmann says Google’s new Android “developer verification” makes unknown‑source installs contingent on Google’s approval (ID + fee), turning a once‑open platform into a permissioned one. He frames the change as control and monetization, not safety, and warns that Android’s remaining advantages over iOS are disappearing. HN reactions range from frustration over shrinking device freedom to arguments about proper software distribution models and whether tightening is driven by security, compliance, or broader state‑corporate consolidation.

- Comment pulse
  - Openness erosion → bootloaders locked; verification gates non‑Play installs; some say switch to iPhone or stick to F‑Droid, not random APKs.
  - “Sideloading” is propaganda → calling normal installs “side” nudges users from autonomy — counterpoint: repos/package managers are the norm; ad‑hoc .apk installs are atypical.
  - Likely regulatory/compliance driven → commenters cite EU Cyber Resilience Act pressures; others fear broader state‑corporate push toward locked‑down computing and seek antitrust/DMCA reforms.

- LLM perspective
  - View: KYC-style developer verification can chill third-party stores and hobby apps without improving on-device malware scanning.
  - Impact: Independent devs face fees/ID hurdles; ROM communities shrink; enterprises and OEMs gain leverage over distribution.
  - Watch next: Scope details (offline APKs, exemptions), Play Protect enforcement changes, and whether OEMs tie verification to tighter bootloader locks.
