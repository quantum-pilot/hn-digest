TL;DR
The stamp meant: don’t quote this cable verbatim outside its cryptographic channel. U.S. WWII/early–Cold War doctrine required “paraphrasing” (aggressively rewording while preserving meaning) before redistributing decrypted material, to deny known-plaintext comparisons that help break codes. A 1950 Army manual formalized how: reorder sentences, swap synonyms, prune repetitions/proper names. The rule reflects hard lessons—Allies exploited repeated texts to attack Enigma—so paraphrasing limited risk when the same information had to travel via different channels or keys.

Comment pulse
- Allies seeded “cribs”: gardening and Mincemeat created predictable phrases to read Enigma; routine salutations and weather openers also leaked plaintext.
- “In depth” key reuse across messages is disastrous; modern echo: nonce reuse can break AES-GCM and exposed Bitcoin wallets.
- Colossus context: special-purpose key-tester for Lorenz, not a general-purpose computer; museums show replicas — counterpoint: debated ENIAC influence.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat paraphrasing as a policy-controlled transformation step, with checklists: reorder, synonymize, prune names; audit parity to verify meaning preserved.
- Impact: Shapes archival handling and press briefings; today, avoid copy-paste across encrypted and public systems to prevent inadvertent crib creation.
- Watch next: Locate pre-1945 U.S. directives; quantify paraphrase effectiveness; build tools to flag plaintext overlap across transport layers and keys.
