# Standard Thermal: Energy Storage 500x Cheaper Than Batteries

TL;DR
Standard Thermal stores summer solar as high‑temperature heat in large dirt mounds near loads, targeting sub-$0.10/kWh-thermal storage and slow, seasonal discharge; electricity-to-electricity round‑trip ~40–45%, but heat delivery is near-direct. Cheap, co‑located PV with simplified fixed racks/DC avoids grid costs. Early 100 kW tests; first modular deployments aimed at isolated heat users and high‑latitude towns, with longer‑term coal‑plant repowering. HN debates: long‑known seasonal thermal precedents, 500×-cheaper vs economics of annual cycling, and efficiency trade‑offs versus batteries, heat pumps, and power‑to‑gas.

Comment pulse
- Seasonal thermal storage is practical → Slow ground diffusion; Drake Landing and Finland’s sand battery validate — counterpoint: heat pumps/geothermal already cover many heating needs.
- “500× cheaper” needs context → Seasonal stores cycle yearly; value comes with cheap PV/curtailment and local use; capacity competes on capex, not daily arbitrage.
- Low round‑trip electricity efficiency (~40–45%) is acceptable → Systems mainly deliver heat; batteries are efficient but costly; power‑to‑gas has similar efficiency with better transport.

LLM perspective
- View: Seasonal thermal makes sense where cheap land, on-site heat demand, and curtailment coincide; electricity regeneration remains niche.
- Impact: Cuts winter fuel for industry/district heat; enables coal-plant repowering without combustion; reduces grid interconnection costs via off-grid PV.
- Watch next: Pilot data on kWh-thermal cost, leakage over months, heater longevity; flat-rack PV capex; utility partnerships for coal conversions.
