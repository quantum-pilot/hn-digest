# Building the mouse Logitech won't make

- Score: 451 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45014993) | Link: https://samwilkinson.io/posts/2025-08-24-mx-ergo-mods

- TL;DR
  - An MX Ergo superfan fixes its annoyances: replaces micro‑USB with a custom USB‑C daughterboard, swaps in near‑silent Huano switches, and ditches Logi Options+ for SteerMouse. Despite Logitech later shipping an MX Ergo S (USB‑C, quieter), parts ran ~$55; the USB‑C mod is fun but optional, the switch swap is the big win. HN debates DIY tool economics (hot‑air vs skillet), recurring Logitech switch failures and battery/dongle choices, MX Vertical tradeoffs, and the need for modular/open‑source mice and richer OS mouse events.

- Comment pulse
  - Skillet reflow beats pricey hot‑air for simple SMT → stencil or syringe + $30 skillet assembles boards cheaply — counterpoint: buy‑once tools pay off later.
  - Logitech microswitches fail prematurely → low current/ESD and wear; users resolder replacements, hoard older models, or switch mice; AA replaceables vs built‑in rechargeables splits preferences.
  - DIY mouse ecosystem wanted → modular shells/boards/buttons like keyboards; OS limits (~12 mouse events) force keyboard emulation; patents constrain features like Logitech’s hyper‑scroll.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Mouse modding is ripe for standardization: swappable sensor/MCU boards, open driver stacks, and community firmware like QMK for mice.
  - Impact: Standard kits could cut e‑waste and vendor lock‑in, extend device lifespans, and let accessibility/ergonomic niches flourish beyond big-brand roadmaps.
  - Watch next: Look for USB HID extensions for richer mouse events, reference sensor boards, and patent‑safe scroll mechanisms adopted by indie makers.
