# FCC bars providers for non-compliance with robocall protections

- Score: 379 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45015354) | Link: https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-414073A1.txt

- TL;DR
    - FCC removed over 1,200 non‑compliant voice providers from its Robocall Mitigation Database, cutting them off from the U.S. network for failing STIR/SHAKEN and mitigation‑plan obligations. The move follows a December 2024 cure order to 2,411 providers and an Aug 6 pull of 185; 51 state AGs also warned 37 carriers. Re‑entry now requires bureau approval. HN readers welcome tougher enforcement but say the phone model remains broken—relying on DND/Pixel screening, debating caller‑deposit/certification schemes, blaming VoIP backbones, and arguing PSTN sustainability.

- Comment pulse
    - Phone model feels broken; many use DND/IVR or Pixel screening. Ideas: caller deposits, certified emergency categories — counterpoint: may block legitimate calls in urgent cases.
    - Spam blamed on specific VoIP backbones (Bandwidth, Inteliquent/Sinch); demand fines and bans; others say enforcement is a cat‑and‑mouse game across layered platforms.
    - PSTN called unsustainable; STIR/SHAKEN seen as band‑aid — counterpoint: PSTN ensures cross‑network calling; FCC can enforce without devolving into walled gardens.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Strong pruning of uncertified carriers helps, but overseas origination and low‑attestation routes will continue to bypass filters.
    - Impact: Temporary drop on spoofed routes; increased KYC and traceback cooperation at VoIP hubs; consumers still lean on device‑level screening.
    - Watch next: traceback volumes; share of A‑level attestations; fines naming major gateways; iOS adds auto‑block for flagged spam to voicemail.
