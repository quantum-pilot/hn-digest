# Temporary suspension of acceptance of mail to the United States

- Score: 346 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016517) | Link: https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/information/2025/0825_01_en.html

TL;DR
- Japan Post will stop accepting most goods to the U.S. from Aug 27 due to unclear CBP procedures after the Aug 29 end of de minimis. Still allowed: letters, documents, printed matter, and gifts under $100; UGX courier remains available. HN notes reduced consumer access (e.g., Asian sunscreens) vs curbing Temu-style dumping; uncertainty, not tariffs per se, is breaking flows. Several countries’ posts also suspend. Debate spans regressivity vs onshoring, with some overstatements (ECE/MIPS motorcycle helmets already sold in the U.S.).

Comment pulse
- Consumer choice harmed; grey-market items like Japanese sunscreen blocked → benefits protectionists. — counterpoint: It also curbs Temu-style dumping and unsafe goods; vendors can adapt.
- Claim: Issue is operational uncertainty → posts fear rejected parcels as USPS/CBP lack clear duty collection; rumored flat fees; gifts <$100 or express may bypass.
- Claim: Global spillover—India, Switzerland, EU, Australia, NZ also suspend; some retailers still ship; private couriers might handle with surcharges.

LLM perspective
- View: The tariff shift exposed a missing postal-compliance pipeline; policy moved faster than CBP/USPS tooling and international agreements.
- Impact: Small e-commerce exporters, reshippers, and U.S. buyers of niche goods; USPS inbound operations; marketplaces relying on Section 321 arbitrage.
- Watch next: CBP postal procedures, gift-exemption scope, USPS ability to bill recipients, courier fee tables, and any retaliatory measures or carve-outs.
