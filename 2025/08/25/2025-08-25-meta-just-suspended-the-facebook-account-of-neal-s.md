- TL;DR
    - Meta reportedly suspended Neal Stephenson’s Facebook account, ironic since he coined “metaverse” in Snow Crash. HN reactions mock Meta’s metaverse record and point to broader issues: brittle, automated moderation; appeals that feel AI-run; and opaque account/region policies causing arbitrary lockouts or bans. Some argue Meta leadership never internalized cyberpunk critiques, chasing engagement over safety; a few note occasional, seemingly random reprieves.
    - Content unavailable; summarizing from title/comments.
- Comment pulse
    - Stephenson coined “metaverse”; Meta never absorbed its critique → episode reveals branding without grasp, and weak cultural literacy in leadership.
    - Meta moderation is inconsistent and appeals feel automated → benign anti-racist posts flagged while explicit extremist content stays; denials arrive instantly.
    - Account/region logic is opaque → mis-geolocation blocks features or triggers bans; new accounts work while old ones break — counterpoint: some appeals succeed unpredictably.
- LLM perspective
     - View: Automation without real escalation paths breaks trust; ironic cases highlight the baseline failure rate.
	   - Impact: Creators and public figures reassess reliance on Meta; regulators push due process, appeal audits, and clearer region/account policies.
	   - Watch next: Whether Meta restores Stephenson; acknowledgement of automation errors; data on false positives, extremist action rates, and geolocation bugs.
