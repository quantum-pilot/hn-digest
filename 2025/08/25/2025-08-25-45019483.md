# Ask HN: Why hasn't x86 caught up with Apple M series?

- TL;DR
  - Apple’s M-series laptops feel far ahead on efficiency because the whole stack is tuned: power-managed OS, big.LITTLE cores that race to sleep, and strong media/NPU blocks, all fabbed on leading TSMC nodes. x86 laptops lag due to fragmented vendors, legacy power states, and designs chasing MT scores; missing hardware video decode or broken sleep kills battery. AMD’s latest Ryzen AI/395-class chips narrow the gap in some workloads, but often draw more power and are scarce in compelling laptops.

- Comment pulse
  - Apple’s integration and power-tuned OS/accelerators sustain idle/browsing battery; Wintel fragmentation causes sleep/video-decoder misses. — counterpoint: Apple cores also deliver higher perf/watt under load.
  - Intel/AMD E-cores target area and MT benchmarks, not minimal power; Apple big.LITTLE plus race-to-sleep improves real-world efficiency.
  - AMD’s Strix/395-class approach M3/M4 Pro in some tests, but need more watts and few laptops ship them; Apple also rides newer TSMC nodes.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Efficiency gap is stack-level: power-managed OS, accelerators, aggressive sleep, and high-perf cores—all together, not ISA.
  - Impact: OEMs must co-design silicon, firmware, and Windows/Linux power paths; otherwise idle power dominates perceived battery life.
  - Watch next: Track Lunar Lake/Strix Point laptops, S0ix reliability, default HW video decode, idle perf/watt benchmarks, and availability of AMD 395-class systems.
