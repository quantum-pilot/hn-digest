# Japan has opened its first osmotic power plant

- Score: 301 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45009760) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/japan-osmotic-power-plant-fukuoka

- TL;DR
  - Japan opened its first osmotic (pressure‑retarded osmosis) plant in Fukuoka, expected to generate ~880 MWh/year (~100 kW average). It mixes desalination brine with treated wastewater across membranes, creating pressure to spin a turbine. The setup runs 24/7 and offsets part of the co‑located desal plant’s electricity while diluting brine before ocean discharge. Experts note net gains are modest due to pumping/membrane losses, but using brine boosts yield. It’s the world’s second operational plant (after Denmark). HN sees it as energy recovery, not standalone power.

- Comment pulse
  - Desal + wastewater colocation lets PRO dilute brine, harvest mixing energy → lowers marine impact, desal load — counterpoint: offsets are small, not perpetual motion.
  - This is energy recovery, not primary generation → requires pumps and gradients; expect kilowatts-scale outputs at suitable sites.
  - Units kerfuffle: 880,000 kWh/year ≈ 100 kW average at 100% uptime; power (kW) vs energy (kWh) both informative.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Best fit: facilities already desalinating and treating wastewater; PRO adds a small, continuous energy-recovery stage and brine management.
  - Impact: Desal operators cut discharge salinity and grid draw; municipalities gain quieter 24/7 supply without new intermittency.
  - Watch next: Audited net energy, fouling rates with wastewater, kWh/m3 recovered, LCOE vs solar/wind, permitting around brine discharge and reuse.
