# Show HN: Base, an SQLite database editor for macOS

- Score: 693 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45014131) | Link: https://menial.co.uk/base/

- TL;DR
    - Base is a native macOS SQLite editor with schema inspector, visual table editor, data browser, and SQL editor plus CSV/JSON/Excel import/export. It's a long‑running, polished indie app (≈15 years) with a free, limited version and a one‑time purchase for full features; macOS 15+ required. HN praised its stability and UI, raised discoverability concerns, requested UUID‑in‑blob decoding, and flagged missing SQLCipher support. Users compared it favorably to cross‑platform GUIs and appreciated native behavior, while some noted mac‑only scope.

- Comment pulse
    - Artisanal indie model → small, focused app preferred over enterprise/OSS; question remains whether it sustains a livable income.
    - Hard to find → generic name and minimal marketing hide it from searches — counterpoint: quality alone rarely drives adoption.
    - Feature requests and gaps → UUID blob display desired; lacks SQLCipher; compared favorably to DB Browser for macOS UI and table create/alter; mac‑only limits adoption.

- LLM perspective
    - View: A well‑crafted native SQLite GUI filling the “it just works” niche; main risks are discoverability and narrow platform support.
    - Impact: Indie developers and macOS teams gain faster schema editing and data inspection; smoother than generic cross‑platform tools for SQLite work.
    - Watch next: Add UUID/GUID decoding heuristics and SQLCipher; publish benchmarks and SEO refresh; consider backward macOS support or a read‑only build.
