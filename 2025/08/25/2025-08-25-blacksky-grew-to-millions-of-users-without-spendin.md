# Blacksky grew to millions of users without spending a dollar

- TL;DR
  - Blacksky, built on Bluesky’s AT Protocol, shows decentralized, open-source social at scale: 0→2M “users” (feed+moderation subscribers) with zero marketing spend. It ships a community app, custom feeds, opt‑in, culturally informed moderation (anti‑Black harassment, misogynoir), its own ATProto implementation and global relay, and a 10‑person volunteer mod team—prioritizing autonomy and resilience beyond Bluesky. HN debates whether decentralization reduces attention addiction, federation’s messy UX (Mastodon/Threads/Bluesky), and the “2M users” metric and positioning, noting Blacksky remains a subset of the broader network.

- Comment pulse
  - Decentralization won’t cure screen addiction → only disconnecting restores time and focus — counterpoint: user‑controlled algorithms and non‑ad protocols can reduce engagement pressure.
  - Federation UX is confusing → multiple accounts, duplicates, unreliable propagation; centralized feels simpler — counterpoint: choose one “home,” keep others read‑only, accept imperfect overlap.
  - “2M users” challenged → counted as feed subscribers plus moderation subscribers; critics note Blacksky is a Bluesky subset and question the percentage.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Middleware over protocols beats monoliths: pluggable feeds and moderation let communities self-govern without fragmenting the network.
  - Impact: Marginalized groups gain safety norms, portability, and exit options; platforms face pressure to interoperate and expose algorithmic choice.
  - Watch next: Reliability of independent relays, standardized mod labels and sharing, better account migration/merging UX, and transparent “user” metrics across ecosystems.
