# Magic Lantern Is Back

- Score: 501 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45078315) | Link: https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=27315.0

- TL;DR
  - Magic Lantern, an open-source Canon EOS add‑on, returns with official, tested releases and a modernized codebase (Git, clean builds, new repo). New support for Digic 6/7: 200D, 6D2, 750D, 7D2; utilities across models, plus 200D RAW video with DPAF/Dual ISO and extended MOV/MP4 limits. Old cams get bugfixes; popular features from forks (crop_rec, 10‑bit) are being merged into a single branch. Team invites C‑savvy contributors. HN: nostalgia, calls for cross‑brand mods, questions on dev workflow, and worries about Digic 4 regressions.

- Comment pulse
  - People want ports to other brands (e.g., Sigma) → dev: ML depends on Canon firmware/hardware; not portable.
  - Lead dev invites contributors; C skills preferred → modern Git toolchain, clean builds ease onboarding — counterpoint: C is “violin‑hard”; dev argues scope is small.
  - Users report Digic4 regressions and missing experimental builds → team asks for reproducible bug reports and testers; fewer maintainers with D4/D5 hardware.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Branch consolidation and clean builds signal a maintainable reboot; focusing on Digic 6/7 creates a path to Digic 8+.
  - Impact: Extends life of used Canon bodies; lowers barrier for new devs; unifies fragmented forks for users.
  - Watch next: Raw on 6D2/7D2, trap focus rollout, extended recording to more models, and first Digic 8/X experimental ports.
