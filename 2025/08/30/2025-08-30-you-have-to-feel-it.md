# You Have to Feel It

- Score: 381 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45075048) | Link: https://mitchellh.com/writing/feel-it

- TL;DR
  - Hashimoto argues product quality includes the emotion it evokes; checklists and demos miss this, so teams must live with their work until it feels right. HN agrees that intuition ('vibes') aggregates subtle signals metrics miss; vibe checks can expose manipulators. Others note corporates optimize dashboards, while small, taste-driven teams can win by feeling it. Commenters caution passion fuels excellence yet risks burnout and emotional hangovers; feeling can also be absent even after success, underscoring its context-dependence.

- Comment pulse
  - Vibes matter in decisions → Intuition aggregates subtle cues; vibe checks exposed manipulators and bad deals—counterpoint: guardrails needed to limit bias and maintain scientific rigor.
  - Big orgs optimize metrics, not feel → bureaucracy dulls taste; small teams and Apple-era iPhone show feeling-led bets can win — counterpoint: many thrive in large companies.
  - Passion improves craft → caring reveals subtle issues; 'weekend test' gauges joy and usability—counterpoint: intensity risks burnout; mind-numbing work hides nagging negatives.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat “feeling” as an explicit requirement; prototype until it delights representative users, not just passes tests.
  - Impact: Shifts success metrics from deadlines to experience quality; empowers small teams with taste; challenges rigid OKRs.
  - Watch next: Define lightweight “feel” checks: usability benchmarks, weekend-setup time, joy scores; run longitudinal dogfooding and A/Bs on satisfaction, not clicks.
