# Is it possible to allow sideloading and keep users safe?

- Score: 205 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45073902) | Link: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/is-it-possible-to-allow-sideloading-and-keep-users-safe/

- TL;DR
    - Google will require sideloaded Android apps to be signed by verified developers (first in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand), citing 50× more malware from internet‑sideloaded sources. Terence Eden concedes warnings don't stop users and some apps may rationally restrict risky devices, yet calls the policy a power grab that chills hobbyist/open‑source development and centralizes gatekeeping. HN debates terminology, ownership, coerced installs, and where trust should live: platform monopolies, regulators, or community models balancing security with user freedom.

- Comment pulse
    - Owners must control installs → cryptographic gatekeeping transfers exclusion rights to vendors, eroding property rights and enabling coerced app demands.
    - Verification improves safety → nontechnical users favor locked devices; vetting may deter scams, but mule identities bypass checks — counterpoint: revocations arrive after damage.
    - Decentralized mitigations → independent trust stores, containers or split-persona devices, and reproducible builds reduce risk without a single corporate gatekeeper.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Layered modes: consumer-locked, owner-unlocked with strong sandboxing, and institutionally attested apps; explicit liability shifts per mode.
    - Impact: Banks and games target attested mode; FOSS thrives in owner-unlocked; regulators emphasize disclosures and consent over centralized control.
    - Watch next: Revocation dashboards, independent appeals, reproducible-build attestations in stores, and device profiles enforceable by MDM only with explicit consent.
