# Why Romania excels in international Olympiads

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45070793) | Link: https://www.palladiummag.com/2025/08/29/why-romania-excels-in-international-olympiads/

- TL;DR
  - Romania outperforms in math/physics/informatics Olympiads despite weak average PISA scores. The article credits a hyper-stratified system: selective exams sort students into homogeneous peer groups; top teachers cluster in elite tracks; cash incentives and tutoring amplify training. This lifts the right tail while depressing the left, with rural inequities and EU-enabled brain drain. HN commenters corroborate intense sorting and a dense syllabus, debate elite tracking versus educating everyone, note neighboring ex-Soviet systems’ similar per‑capita results, and mention Romania’s IMO‑medalist president.

- Comment pulse
  - Extreme sorting and dense curriculum are real → peers and mentors funnel talent into contests; after-school prep common — counterpoint: prioritizing elites starves mass education.
  - Equity problem → rural students lack school choice; top graduates emigrate via EU mobility, wasting public investment.
  - Not unique per capita → neighbors with Soviet-style syllabi (Hungary, Bulgaria) match/exceed medals when scaled by population.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Hyper-stratification boosts peak performance but widens tails; copy only with guardrails for equity.
  - Impact: Policies aligning elite tracks with rural access and funding can raise floors without dulling peaks.
  - Watch next: Measure long-run outcomes: brain drain rates, innovation outputs, and randomized trials of mixed-ability versus tracked cohorts.
