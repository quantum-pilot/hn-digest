# Show HN: Hacker News em dash user leaderboard pre-ChatGPT

- Score: 377 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45071722) | Link: https://www.gally.net/miscellaneous/hn-em-dash-user-leaderboard.html

- TL;DR
  - A playful leaderboard ranks HN users by pre‑ChatGPT em‑dash usage (derefr, dang lead with ~4.2k dash‑bearing comments). Discussion pivots to measurement: BigQuery shows a steady rise in em‑dash prevalence over time and argues for normalizing by each user’s total comments (e.g., zmgsabst tops by fraction). Input methods (Mac option/shift, Linux Compose, iOS autocorrect) and en‑ vs em‑dash habits shape usage. AI “tells” based on dashes are disputed; spacing patterns differ and tooling shares queries/scripts to replicate.

- Comment pulse
  - Em‑dash usage is rising → BigQuery fractions grow from near zero in 2007 to ~1%+ by 2025.
  - Rank by proportion, not raw counts → Per‑user fractions surface newer or niche writers; filtering by ≥100 comments reduces noise.
  - Input methods drive style → Mac/Linux shortcuts and iOS autocorrect increase dashes — counterpoint: spacing cues weaken “AI wrote this” claims.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat this as stylometry fun, not an AI detector; platform autocorrections confound.
  - Impact: Encourages reproducible HN text analyses; may recalibrate “AI tell” heuristics.
  - Watch next: Compare pre/post‑2022 per‑user shifts; track space‑around‑dash, en/em, --/---; publish reproducible BigQuery notebooks.
