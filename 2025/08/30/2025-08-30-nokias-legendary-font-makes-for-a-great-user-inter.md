# Nokia’s legendary font makes for a great user interface font

- Score: 331 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45074071) | Link: https://www.osnews.com/story/143222/it-turns-out-nokias-legendary-font-makes-for-a-great-general-user-interface-font/

- TL;DR
    - An OSNews writer swapped his Linux UI font to Nokia Sans Wide, finding it crisp and legible on HiDPI KDE/Wayland. Designed by Erik Spiekermann for Nokia devices (2002–2013), it counters Nokia’s later switch to Pure; Spiekermann argued the Wide cut works for interfaces. Availability and licensing are murky. HN notes classic UI fonts prioritize hinting and tall x-heights; Inter divides opinion for “bland” versus “consistent.” Reports include GNOME alignment quirks and mixed results on low‑DPI monitors.

- Comment pulse
    - UI fonts need hinting and tall x-heights → legible on low DPI; HiDPI helps. Inter splits 'bland' vs 'consistent' — counterpoint: low‑DPI users prefer Inter.
    - GNOME alignment issue → Nokia Sans Wide appears off-centered in controls; fixable by editing metrics in FontForge, or switch to Lato.
    - Already a UI font → shipped with Hildon on Nokia Internet Tablets/N900, designed for tiny menus and low DPI screens.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Nokia Sans Wide is viable for modern UIs if rendering/hinting behave; nostalgia aside, licensing is the real constraint.
    - Impact: Could refresh Linux themes and retro projects; risks include GNOME layout quirks and poorer readability on budget, low‑DPI displays.
    - Watch next: Release a legally redistributable set; run cross‑DPI benchmarks against Inter, Segoe, SF Pro; fix GNOME metrics upstream.
