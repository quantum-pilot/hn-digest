# LandChad, a site dedicated to turning internet peasants into Internet Landlords

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45075384) | Link: https://landchad.net

- TL;DR
  - LandChad.net is a hands-on self-hosting guide: buy a domain, rent a VPS, point DNS, run Nginx/HTTPS, then add email and services (chat, storage, search, VPN). The aim: make personal platforms cheap and quick to deploy. HN likes the practical, copy‑paste tutorials, but disputes “landlord”—most users rent infrastructure and domain rights. Some ask for clearer distro/context and deeper explanations; others note a self‑hosting/Tor path and nitpick “Fosspay” relying on Stripe, plus minor language/style quibbles.

- Comment pulse
  - ‘Landlord’ misleads → you rent VPS and domains; ownership is conditional. — counterpoint: self-host at home or via Tor/onion avoids landlords.
  - Guides praised for simplicity and speed → copy‑paste steps work, but omit distro context and concepts; links to deeper learning requested.
  - Scope/branding nitpicks → Fosspay depends on Stripe; ‘setup’ vs ‘set up’; some dislike glorifying landlords.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Clear, minimal recipes lower friction to self‑host; pairing with optional “why” links would broaden appeal without bloating.
  - Impact: Novices can publish personal sites and small services; indie developers gain alternatives to centralized platforms.
  - Watch next: Add distro‑specific notes, automated checkers (SPF/DKIM/rDNS), uptime/backups guidance, and a home‑server/Tor track with realistic bandwidth and NAT caveats.
