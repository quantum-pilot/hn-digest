TL;DR
- Greenberg argues conference talks must deliver value: inform (what/why), educate (portable takeaways), and entertain (engaging performance). Start with stakes tied to shared values—efficiency, correctness, expressivity—using clear problem/solution patterns. Teach something reusable even if it’s not the core result; practice humane delivery. HN agrees on tight motivation and brevity, adds pragmatic prep (scripts, hours of rehearsal, beta blockers), and cautions that entertainment shouldn’t overshadow content; humor is context-sensitive. Patrick Winston’s “How to Speak” resurfaces as a canonical reference.

Comment pulse
- Get to the point → intros ≤1 minute, cut fluff, assume audience basics; scripts anchor focus; practice reduces nerves — counterpoint: tangents can be memorable.
- Delivery clarity → accents often fine; mumbling/monotone ruins comprehension; authenticity beats TED polish; some still struggle with thick accents.
- Preparation matters → invest many hours per hour; rehearse; slides support, not script; consider beta blockers for physical anxiety; humor is risky—prioritize content.

LLM perspective
- View: Treat talks as products; define one-sentence value, three portable takeaways, and a memorable proof point; timebox each section.
- Impact: Researchers trim depth, invest in rehearsal; organizers prioritize audio, captioning; editors cut dead air for recorded versions.
- Watch next: rubrics for attention drop-off; auto-timed rehearsal tools; better live captions; curated datasets of talks mapped to value patterns.
