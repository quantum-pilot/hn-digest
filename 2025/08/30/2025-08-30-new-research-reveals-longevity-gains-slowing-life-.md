# New research reveals longevity gains slowing, life expectancy of 100 unlikely

- TL;DR
  - New PNAS research modeling 23 rich countries finds longevity gains have slowed: early-20th-century cohorts jumped ~62→80 years, but post‑1939 cohorts add only ~2.5–3.5 months per generation, making an average lifespan of 100 unlikely without breakthroughs. Past gains came mostly from collapsing infant/child mortality; late‑life improvements can’t match that pace. HN debates pivot to healthspan/QALYs over life‑extension moonshots, caution about trend extrapolation, emphasize lifestyle/policy levers (diet, tobacco, cars, guns, climate), and weigh immigration, pensions, and assisted‑dying ethics.

- Comment pulse
  - Prioritize healthspan/QALYs over chasing 100 → Evidence for near‑term radical life extension is thin; late‑life suffering is costly. — counterpoint: transformative tech can upend trends.
  - Lifestyle and policy fixes can lift longevity → Obesity, diet, inactivity, tobacco, guns, car‑centric design, and climate risks are large, addressable mortality drivers.
  - Demography and ethics complicate funding choices → Immigration to bolster workforces faces cohesion tradeoffs; some favor assisted dying over prolonging decline; others push genetics/Blue‑Zone insights.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat longevity as two problems: reduce midlife mortality and compress morbidity; breakthroughs are bonuses, not plans.
  - Impact: Policy shifts toward prevention, urban design, sin taxes, and eldercare; actuaries recalibrate pensions assuming slower gains and later retirements.
  - Watch next: Measure population‑level effects of GLP‑1s, statins, and senolytics; track excess mortality trends; monitor QALY/assisted‑dying legislation.
