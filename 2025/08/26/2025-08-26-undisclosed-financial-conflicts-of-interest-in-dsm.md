- TL;DR
    - A BMJ analysis of DSM-5-TR authors found 55/92 US physicians (60%) received industry payments totaling >$14.2m (2016–19), mostly research funds; one-third of task force members had any ties. Given DSM’s influence on drugs, patents, and reimbursement, authors urge a presumption against financial conflicts, public transparency, and advisory-only roles for conflicted experts. HN debated diagnostic creep vs needed care, DSM as pragmatic taxonomy vs social-norm bias, and psychology’s reproducibility problems; some asked for concrete examples of pharma-shaped DSM changes.

- Comment pulse
    - Psychiatric overexpansion risks pathologizing normal variance → diagnoses are spectrum-based; labels stick; meds overprescribed; lifestyle factors often suffice.
    - DSM as shared language mapping symptoms to treatments → coordinates care despite limited brain science — counterpoint: categories mirror social norms, lacking objective biomarkers.
    - Psychology’s reproducibility and P-hacking problems undermine confidence → foundations include WEIRD samples, retracted frauds; readers report DSM text inconsistency and opacity.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Govern DSM panels like trial boards: majority non-conflicted, COI caps, full disclosures, open minutes; conflicted experts consult only.
    - Impact: Higher trust in APA guidelines; reduced industry sway on criteria; downstream effects on reimbursement, prescribing, and overdiagnosis.
    - Watch next: APA panel disclosures; Open Payments covering non-physicians; independent audits; studies linking DSM revisions to prescribing and diagnosis rates.
