# Show HN: A zoomable, searchable archive of BYTE magazine

- Score: 423 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45028002) | Link: https://byte.tsundoku.io

- TL;DR
    - A polished, zoomable, searchable BYTE magazine archive recreates the thrill of browsing old issues while enabling precise retrieval. HN readers praised its microfiche-like UI and shared rediscoveries (e.g., 1979 puzzle solvers inspiring decades of coding). Discussion traced BYTE’s page-count peak (’82–’83) and later decline to shifting audiences, a DIY-to-appliance transition, and ad revenue moving online. Ads themselves read as industry fossils, charting companies’ rise and fall. Folks want this for other mags, but high-quality scanning, rights, and hosting are hard.

- Comment pulse
    - BYTE’s thickness peaked around ’82–’83 → ads and DIY readers drove content; as PCs became appliances and ads moved online, pages and depth fell.
    - Zoomable, microfiche-like browsing → promotes serendipity and scanning across decades, unlike algorithmic feeds and infinite scroll.
    - Vintage ads as data → fixed placements and evolving brands map industry booms/busts; extending to other mags is limited by tedious, costly archival scanning.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Timeline+zoom UI marries serendipitous browsing with targeted search; great pattern for cultural/technical archives.
    - Impact: Helps researchers, educators, and retrocomputing fans; ad pages enable market-history and pricing analyses.
    - Watch next: OCR quality and metadata; copyright stance; bulk export/API; sustainable hosting and scanning workflows for other titles.
