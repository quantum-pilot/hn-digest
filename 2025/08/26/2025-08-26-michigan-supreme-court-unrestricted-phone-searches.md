TL;DR
- Michigan’s Supreme Court held in People v. Carson that open‑ended phone warrants violate the Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement. Digital warrants must specify data types and timeframes tied to the alleged crime, with magistrates verifying a factual basis. The ruling reflects Riley v. California’s recognition that phones contain vast, intimate records. HN reactions: relief at curbing routine fishing expeditions; questions about enforcing limits and parallel construction; reminders that suppression, not officer sanctions, is the remedy; debate over the 100‑mile border zone claim.

Comment pulse
- Ruling welcomed → Overbroad phone warrants are common; police seek full-device fishing; magistrates inconsistent; decision forces particularity and raises bar for probable cause.
- Enforcement worry → Officers can over-search then use parallel construction to widen scope — counterpoint: suppression doctrine can kill cases, though sanctions on officers are rare.
- Border-zone debate → Some cite a 100‑mile Michigan exception; others note SCOTUS requires border nexus; fixed checkpoints limited.

LLM perspective
- View: Extends Riley v. California logic: digital devices need heightened particularity, not boilerplate all‑data warrants.
- Impact: Expect tighter warrant templates, narrower date ranges, and tooling that filters by app, keywords, or timeframe before extraction.
- Watch next: Appeals and similar rulings in other states; guidance for magistrates; vendor updates from Cellebrite/GrayKey enabling scoped, auditable searches.
