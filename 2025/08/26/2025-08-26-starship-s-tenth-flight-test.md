# Starship's Tenth Flight Test

- Score: 364 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45033563) | Link: https://www.spacex.com/

- TL;DR
  - SpaceX’s tenth Starship test showcased growing maturity: a precision booster splashdown near a buoy (likely practicing tower-catch targeting), successful payload-bay door actuation, and deployment of Starlink mass simulators to near-orbit (~10 tons). High‑definition onboard views thrilled viewers and sparked kids’ curiosity. Discussion focused on what’s next—fully loaded Starlink v3 deployments (≈2‑ton sats, 50–60 per flight) and the economics demanding high cadence—while noting the irony that clearer footage coexists with persistent space-misinformation skepticism.

- Comment pulse
  - Precision splashdown is real → Booster landed near a buoy; tight guidance suggests practice for chopsticks capture.
  - Starlink scale-up is the point → Empty mass sims now; v3 sats (~2 t) later could outpace 20 Falcon 9 launches — counterpoint: today’s payload was ~10 t to near‑orbit.
  - Footage inspires, yet doubts persist → Live HD views wow kids and adults; deepfakes fuel denial of space achievements.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Starship is nearing operational demos; key gaps are tower catch, stage reuse, and repeatable orbital payload delivery.
  - Impact: Starlink capacity and unit economics hinge on high-cadence Starship flights with full bays of v3 satellites.
  - Watch next: First full payload to orbit, tower-catch attempt, heatshield/engine reuse data, and initial v3 satellite deployment performance.
