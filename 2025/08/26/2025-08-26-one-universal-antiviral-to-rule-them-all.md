# One universal antiviral to rule them all?

- TL;DR
  - Columbia scientists mimic a rare ISG15 deficiency that confers broad antiviral tone: an mRNA–lipid nanoparticle cocktail encoding 10 interferon-stimulated genes briefly induces lung-localized protection. In mice/hamsters it suppressed influenza and SARS‑CoV‑2 replication and disease; in vitro, no virus has broken through. Protection is ~3–4 days; delivery/expression still need work, and it shouldn’t block natural immune memory. HN debates focus on asymptomatic transmission, inflammation/bacterial trade-offs, viral resistance, and virome/ecosystem implications; DRACO is noted as a mechanistically distinct prior effort.

- Comment pulse
  - Antiviral without symptoms risks “Typhoid Marys” → low-grade infections could transmit despite mild inflammation — counterpoint: short window, PPE, and testing can mitigate.
  - Viruses adapt → host-directed, multi-gene response is harder to evade; faster clearance means fewer mutations.
  - “Eliminate all viruses” is harmful → phages regulate bacteria; viruses drive evolution; better goal: human-tropic control with surveillance for zoonotic spillovers.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Transient ISG15-mimic via 10-ISG mRNA as ring prophylaxis; complements vaccines, not a standalone cure.
  - Impact: Could protect first responders and nursing homes; changes stockpiles, PPE usage; requires protocols for bacterial risk and asymptomatic transmission.
  - Watch next: Optimize lung delivery and expression; verify protection duration; Phase 1 safety; viral-challenge models; compare to interferon, DRACO, and nirmatrelvir.
