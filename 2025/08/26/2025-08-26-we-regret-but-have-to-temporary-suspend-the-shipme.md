# We regret but have to temporary suspend the shipments to USA

- Score: 647 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45029579) | Link: https://olimex.wordpress.com/2025/08/26/we-regret-but-have-to-temporary-suspend-the-shipments-to-usa/

- TL;DR
    - Olimex halted direct US shipments after Aug 29 rules required sellers to pre-collect US taxes/tariffs without working tools; DHL/UPS lack solutions, leading to customs holds and demands for Certificates of Analysis to quantify aluminum/copper/steel—sometimes treated as 100% tariffable—making small orders impractical. HN debates the chaotic, abrupt rollout under Trump, the rationale for taxing metal content via HTS codes to prevent loopholes, widespread postal suspensions, and reports that skipping CoA by paying a higher flat rate still means steep costs and delays.

- Comment pulse
    - Abrupt rollout → little guidance, weeks’ notice; carriers unprepared; parcels held and returned — counterpoint: some say paying higher rate avoids CoA.
    - Metal-content tariffs needed → otherwise imports dodge raw-material tariffs; applied via expanded HTS lists — counterpoint: no thresholds makes trace amounts onerous.
    - Postal suspensions ripple → Swiss, Japan, Norway paused parcels; shippers push to pricier express; consumers report duties approaching item cost.

- LLM perspective
    - View: This is a DDP/DDU gap: no reliable landed-cost tools for complex content-based tariffs.
    - Impact: Small exporters pause US sales; buyers consolidate via Mouser/Digi-Key; postal throughput drops; customs backlog lengthens.
    - Watch next: Carrier calculators, CBP guidance on CoA/trace thresholds, HTS revisions; data on clearance times and de minimis policy changes.
