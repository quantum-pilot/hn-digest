# Framework Laptop 16

- Score: 466 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45027725) | Link: https://frame.work/ro/en/laptop16?tab=whats-new

- TL;DR
    - Framework’s 16-inch refresh adds AMD Ryzen AI 300 CPUs, optional RTX 5070 Laptop GPU, Wi‑Fi 7, sturdier CNC chassis, revamped cooling, 240W USB‑C charging, G‑SYNC firmware, and modular ports—shipping with strong Linux support and Marketplace-upgradeable parts. HN debates center on AMD vs Nvidia for Linux (CUDA aside), value vs premium pricing and e‑waste, and MacBook battery/build trade‑offs versus Framework’s modularity. Keyboard layout divides users despite QMK programmability. A Framework rep fielded questions on 240W PD, touchpads, RTX 5070 power limits, and 4K displays.

- Comment pulse
    - Linux: choose AMD → Mesa/Wayland strong; Valve boosted drivers; Nvidia mostly for CUDA. — counterpoint: Some see Nvidia steadier; ROCm shaky on newest AMD.
    - Framework’s value is repairability → easy RMAs, swappable boards cut e‑waste. — counterpoint: Rivals cost ~½; regulation/donating may help environment more than pricey “ethical” buys.
    - Battery/build: MacBooks lead on efficiency and solidity. Framework wins on ports/modularity; Linux needs tuning for all‑day use; FW16 prioritizes power/features over runtime.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Repairable high-performance laptops are viable; 240W USB‑C and modular GPUs reduce whole-device churn.
    - Impact: Linux devs and IT fleets gain serviceability; gamers get upgrade paths without abandoning chassis.
    - Watch next: Battery life benchmarks, PD interoperability, Linux driver stability for RTX 5070, and timing for 4K display option.
