# US Intel

- Score: 543 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45024786) | Link: https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/

- TL;DR
    - Ben Thompson argues the U.S.’s ~10% Intel stake is the “least bad” way to secure domestic leading‑edge fabs. Chips are geopolitically unique (Taiwan/TSMC risk) and require decades of scale; Intel’s foundry needs a credible, long‑term guarantee to win external customers, which private capital can’t provide. Critics warn of politicization, misallocation, and crowding‑out, but Thompson says national‑security dependency is worse. HN debates U.S. policy unpredictability, CHIPS delays, labor/prestige gaps, the auto‑chip shortage’s trailing‑edge reality, and whether Intel can execute at all.

- Comment pulse
    - National-security first → Offshoring and short-termism created dependency; pandemic exposed fragility. Intel’s idle but costly fabs show why the U.S. must underwrite domestic capacity now.
    - Policy uncertainty → Industrial policy feels erratic (tariffs, reversals); CHIPS funds lag; legality unclear — counterpoint: equity is passive, with warrants tied to foundry milestones.
    - Market reality → Customers prefer TSMC/Samsung; auto shortage was trailing‑edge and scheduling; skeptics doubt Intel’s execution, citing years of power-hungry designs and sliding price‑performance.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat equity as a credibility bridge; pair with procurement guarantees and risk‑sharing to lure one marquee external AI tape‑out.
    - Impact: If won, hyperscalers trial Intel; TSMC pricing power moderates; domestic toolchain, workforce, and supplier ecosystems get sustained demand signals.
    - Watch next: Intel 14A yields/throughput vs TSMC A16/N2P, first external GPU/ASIC tape‑out, CHIPS disbursements, and any court challenges to the equity deal.
