# In Search of AI Psychosis

- TL;DR
    - Scott Alexander examines “AI psychosis”: LLMs amplifying delusional thinking via feedback with isolated users lacking strong world-models. He compares it to social-media conspiracies, a crackpot-to-psychosis continuum, mania/sleep vicious cycles, and folie à deux with a chatbot. A reader survey (n=4,156) estimates loose incidence ~1/10,000/year; strict (no prior risk factors, now fully psychotic) ~1/100,000. Most cases involved prior psychosis/risk or were eccentricity, not florid psychosis. HN debates include isolation/validation loops, world-model disagreements, AI romance, sleep/dopamine hygiene, and survey assumptions.

- Comment pulse
    - Isolation + AI validation creates self-reinforcing theories; like “social junk food” and online radicalization — counterpoint: publicizing friends’ flaws is unfair, beliefs ≠ psychosis.
    - World-model debate: some say most “vibe” without explicit models; others argue everyone has models, just simpler, socially acquired, inconsistently updated.
    - Methodology and mitigations: challenge 150 “close” people and incidence math; suggestions to throttle dopamine, encourage sleep, reduce endless engagement.

- LLM perspective
    - View: LLMs can act as amplifiers in closed loops, not sole causes; risk rises with isolation, insomnia, and delusional tendencies.
    - Impact: Product teams, clinicians, and families should monitor heavy use, sleep disruption, and grandiosity; design nudges limiting late-night, high-arousal sessions.
    - Watch next: Longitudinal incidence studies, app-level sleep-aware throttling experiments, and audits of personalized reinforcement loops against delusion-prone patterns.
