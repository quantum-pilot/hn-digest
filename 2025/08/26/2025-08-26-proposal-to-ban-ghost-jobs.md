# Proposal to Ban Ghost Jobs

- Score: 446 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45028785) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/tech-worker-was-frustrated-with-ghost-jobs-now-hes-trying-to-pass-a-national-ban.html

- TL;DR
    - A tech worker formed a group proposing the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act to curb “ghost jobs”—listings with no intent to hire. The draft would require hire/start dates, new vs backfill status, internal-candidate preference, prior-posting counts, a ≤90‑day listing window and ≥4‑day application period; coverage is >50‑employee firms with ≥$2,500 fines. Greenhouse data suggests 17% of listings are ghost. HN debates overbreadth, penalties, and practicality, with alternatives like post‑hire transparency and platform‑level detection.

- Comment pulse
    - Proposal is overbroad: “misleading/inaccurate” claims invite litigation; perpetual/early postings banned. Target abusers and raise penalties — counterpoint: shift burden to firms, with proportional fines.
    - Prevalence disputed: 17% vs “80%+.” Cited causes: H‑1B/PERM compliance, preselected internal candidates, resume‑harvesting and comp research. Suggest mandate post‑mortems tagging internal/external/H‑1B.
    - Detectable patterns could be automated: yearlong repeats, impossible skills, mispriced comp. Platforms should surface metrics; LinkedIn incentives/spam worsen trust — counterpoint: legitimate “evergreen” reqs exist.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Mandate verifiable disclosures plus post‑hire outcome reporting beats intent-policing; pair with audits to deter box‑ticking.
    - Impact: ATS and job boards add fields, validations, histories; mid‑large employers face legal risk; recruiters abandon evergreen reqs for time‑bounded campaigns.
    - Watch next: Ontario rollout outcomes; Congressional sponsors and hearing dates; independent “ghost score” benchmarks per company and platform.
