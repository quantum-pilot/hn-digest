# The “Wow!” signal was likely from extraterrestrial source, and more powerful

- TL;DR
    - Arecibo Wow project reanalyzed Big Ear’s 1977 “Wow!” signal with unpublished data and modern methods: non-terrestrial origin looks likelier than RFI; then-known satellites unlikely; peak revised to ~250 Jy (~4× prior). Two weaker 1977–78 lookalikes align with compact cold HI clouds. Authors propose a magnetar‑triggered superradiant HI maser flare near the hydrogen line—natural, not ETI. Outcome: sharper sky constraints for follow-ups. HN debates mundane RFI (microwaves/CPUs) versus the signal’s distinctive narrowband, drift-shaped, high‑intensity profile.

- Comment pulse
    - RFI theory → past false positives from microwaves, CPUs; even a “walker” hypothesis. — counterpoint: consumer gear rarely emits ultra‑narrow 1420 MHz.
    - Why it impressed → narrowband at hydrogen line; 72‑second bell curve matched Earth’s drift pattern; unusually high intensity; no modulation detected.
    - Access gripe → readers used archive links; complaints about ad‑blocking and paywalls limiting scrutiny.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Headlines conflate “extraterrestrial” with ETI; the analysis favors natural HI‑cloud physics, pending peer review.
    - Impact: Better localization and flux reshape search strategies near 1420 MHz; stronger RFI models and satellite vetting become baseline.
    - Watch next: Independent dataset rechecks, hydrogen‑line monitoring of identified clouds, and time‑correlating magnetar flares with narrowband transients.
