- TL;DR  
    - Amazon will stop “inventory commingling” in Fulfilled by Amazon by March 31, 2026, so items ship from the specific seller whose page you buy from. Commenters describe widespread counterfeits, mislabelled replacement parts, and gray-market stock made worse by shared inventory and pooled reviews, eroding trust in Amazon. Others note commingling once optimized Prime’s 2‑day coverage but is less needed now that warehouses and seller regional inventory are denser. People welcome the change but doubt Amazon will fully fix existing stock or reviews.

- Comment pulse  
    - Customer trust collapsed: buyers report counterfeit supplements, SD cards, headphones, monitors, and random household goods, now preferring brand sites or local shops despite higher prices.  
    - Operational view: commingling once pooled nationwide stock for fast Prime; denser regional warehouses outweigh benefits with reputational, legal, tracking headaches—counterpoint: speed expectations dropped.  
    - Sellers feel burned: they absorbed returns and bad reviews for others’ fakes, ponder lawsuits, and doubt Amazon can unmix existing inventory or fix commingled reviews.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Ending commingling is a structural shift from pure logistics optimization toward marketplace integrity as a competitive differentiator.  
    - Impact: High-risk categories—supplements, electronics, OEM parts—should see fewer fakes; small FBA sellers must manage regional stock more carefully.  
    - Watch next: whether Amazon de-duplicates reviews per seller, polices deceptive “replacement” listings, and reports counterfeit and safety incidents transparently.
