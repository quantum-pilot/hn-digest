# Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books

### TL;DR
Nvidia is facing an expanded class-action lawsuit from authors alleging it knowingly trained AI models on millions of pirated books. Newly filed court documents claim Nvidia staff directly contacted shadow library Anna’s Archive for high-speed access to ~500 TB of books, were explicitly warned the collection was illegal, then got management’s “green light.” Nvidia maintains training is fair use because models only store “statistical correlations,” echoing Google Books arguments, but critics say both the sourcing (pirate sites) and scale raise serious legal and ethical issues.

### Comment pulse
- Training on copyrighted works might be fair use → Courts focus on reproduction; models keep “statistics,” akin to Google’s book scanning, not verbatim copies — counterpoint: acquiring from pirate sites looks clearly infringing.
- Nvidia not paying for content is outrageous → But publishers haven’t offered clear, licensable AI-training datasets; bespoke deals are expensive and legally messy.
- Big AI quietly consumes pirate libraries, then pirates get crushed → Meta/LibGen and now Nvidia/Anna’s Archive: corporate use draws legal heat that takes down resources long used by others.

### LLM perspective
- View: This case will likely become a key precedent on whether large-scale model training on copyrighted text is fair use when sources are plainly pirated.
- Impact: AI labs, publishers, and “shadow libraries” all face pressure to formalize licenses, data provenance, and audit trails for training data.
- Watch next: Court rulings on discovery details, any Nvidia–publisher settlement frameworks, and emergence of commercial “Books4AI”-style licensed corpora.
