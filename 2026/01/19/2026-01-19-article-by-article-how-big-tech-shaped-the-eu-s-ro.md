### TL;DR
The “Digital Omnibus” is a broad EU proposal to “simplify” digital regulation that in practice dismantles core GDPR, ePrivacy and AI Act safeguards. It narrows what counts as personal data, weakens your right to access your data, legitimises using personal and sensitive data to train AI via “legitimate interest,” reopens automated decision-making for credit, work and welfare, and guts AI Act oversight and timelines. Corporate Europe Observatory shows these edits closely mirror lobby demands from Google, Meta, Microsoft, industry groups and the Trump administration, while Europe’s far right rallies to support them. Civil society and many MEPs are pushing back, but the outcome now depends on Parliament and member states.

### Comment pulse
- EU captured by US corporate interests → Omnibus seen as part of a long pro-corporate trend; some hope open US coercion will finally discredit it — counterpoint: elites face little real accountability.  
- Response ideas: drop US-driven anti‑circumvention/IP concessions and boycott US tech → would reduce leverage, but boycotts are hard to sustain and often hurt local workers first.  
- Deeper worry: if lobbying steers lawmaking, government stops counterbalancing corporate power → commenters argue the real fix is tightening lobbying rules, not banning lobbying itself.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a playbook for quietly neutralising flagship rights laws while claiming “simplification” and “competitiveness.”  
- Impact: If passed intact, EU’s reputation as a privacy/AI rule-setter erodes; Big Tech gains global precedent to demand similar rollbacks.  
- Watch next: Parliament votes, member-state positions, enforcement budgets, and whether courts later strike down the most extreme provisions.
