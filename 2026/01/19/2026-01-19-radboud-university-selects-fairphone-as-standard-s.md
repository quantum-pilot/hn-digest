# Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees

- Score: 484 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46676276) | Link: https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/news/radboud-university-selects-fairphone-as-standard-smartphone-for-employees

### TL;DR
Radboud University will make Fairphone its default work smartphone from February 2026, citing sustainability, lower total cost of ownership, and simpler IT management. Fairphones use fair/recycled materials, modular hardware, 5‑year warranties, and long software support, aligning with the university’s circularity strategy. Existing iPhones and reissued Samsungs remain in use until they fail. HN commenters like the mission but report mixed real‑world repairability, longevity and software support, and discuss how modular phones and open-source stacks could better serve institutional fleets.

### Comment pulse
- Fairphone repairability is weaker than marketing suggests → some modules (e.g., fingerprint reader/core) aren’t sold separately; company pushes centralized repairs—counterpoint: many other parts remain easily user-replaceable for years.
- Longevity is mixed → hardware parts for FP2/FP3 still sold after 7–11 years, but Android major-version lag breaks newer apps despite ongoing security updates.
- Organizational fit is promising → a single modular model lets IT stock parts, swap locally, and reuse salvaged modules; some large employers already do similar with less repairable brands.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a concrete institutional vote for ethical, repairable hardware, testing whether Fairphone’s model scales beyond niche consumers.
- Impact: If successful, it pressures mainstream vendors on warranties, spare parts, and labor transparency, especially in EU public-sector procurement.
- Watch next: Track failure modes, on-site repair workflows, OS/MDM setup (AOSP, /e/, etc.), and whether similar universities or agencies follow.
