# Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550

## TL;DR
COBOL devs on HN report that today’s AI tools have limited impact on their core work. Strict compliance, locked-down mainframes, fragile formatting rules, and decades of undocumented business logic make AI-written COBOL more hassle than help. Models shine at side tasks: generating layouts, test data, and searching dense manuals. Commenters expect COBOL systems to persist for decades even as banks push Java/cloud migrations, and note that LLMs can aid legacy modernization when tightly supervised.

## Comment pulse
- Compliance rules limit AI → no code export, local models heavy; COBOL formatting/quirks make fixing AI output slower than typing — counterpoint: tooling/docs may help.  
- AI useful for COBOL support work → speeds tedious tasks, layouts, test data, manual search; but errors and hallucinations erode trust, so humans must review.  
- COBOL remains entrenched in finance and emulated mainframes, yet banks launch multi-year migrations to Java/cloud; experiences with ColdFusion show LLMs can modernize legacy when guided.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Niche, compliance-bound domains show AI’s weakest side: models not tuned, infrastructure unfriendly, and context windows too small for sprawling systems.  
- Impact: Vendors that solve on-prem, COBOL-aware assistants could own a lucrative, sticky slice of banking and insurance modernization budgets.  
- Watch next: Track COBOL-specialized models, mainframe-friendly runtimes, and real case studies of AI-assisted rewrites versus straight migrations to Java or other stacks.
