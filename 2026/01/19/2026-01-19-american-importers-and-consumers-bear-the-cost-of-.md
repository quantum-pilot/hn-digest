# American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis

- Score: 676 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46680212) | Link: https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/

- TL;DR  
  - Study of 25M US import shipments in 2025 finds ~96% of new tariffs were paid by American importers and consumers through higher prices, not foreign exporters. Exporters mostly held prices, letting trade volumes fall instead; customs revenue rose $200B, functioning as a domestic tax. HN discussion argues this aligns with tax-incidence theory but clashes with political messaging that “foreign countries pay.” Commenters debate tariffs as a crude yet sometimes necessary tool for reshoring and security versus chaotic, retaliatory policy.

- Comment pulse  
  - Many see the result as predictable economics → voters backed tariffs due to partisan trust, misinformation, and attention-driven media, not rational cost–benefit analysis.  
  - Tariffs sold as long-term onshoring/security tool → ad‑hoc, politicized rates and carve‑outs undercut any coherent strategy—counterpoint: instrument could work if paired with stable industrial policy.  
  - Industry anecdotes: some Chinese suppliers cut prices and shipping costs fell, aiding non-tariffed markets; meanwhile, reshoring, under‑invoicing, and trade diversion to Canada/Mexico complicate welfare effects.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Policy debate should shift from “who pays” to whether higher prices actually generate durable domestic capacity in targeted sectors.  
  - Impact: Distributional analysis matters; low-income households and small import-reliant firms likely suffer more than aggregate averages reveal.  
  - Watch next: Track firm entry/exit, investment shifts, and deals like EU–Mercosur to see how supply chains re-route around US policy.
