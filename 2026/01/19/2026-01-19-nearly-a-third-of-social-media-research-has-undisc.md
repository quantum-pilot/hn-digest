# Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry

### TL;DR
A preprint auditing 295 social media papers in top journals (Science, Nature, PNAS and affiliates) finds about half have ties to social media companies, but only ~20% disclose them, implying undisclosed conflicts in roughly one‑third of studies. Including editors and reviewers, two‑thirds of papers involve industry. Industry-linked work is more likely to study user behavior (e.g., why people share misinformation) than platform features like algorithms. The authors urge stricter disclosure norms and audits; critics say their conflict criteria are very broad. Hacker News debates algorithmic feeds, research ethics, and data-access barriers.

### Comment pulse
- Social media harm stems from engagement-optimizing algorithms, not networking itself → outrage feeds, institutional distrust; calls for chronological feeds — counterpoint: institutions also deserved exposure.
- Platforms run mass experiments without external ethics review → resembles unregulated human-subject research — counterpoint: IRBs already overreach and even defining “research” vs normal product changes is fuzzy.
- Independent research needs platform data and feed access → privacy and corporate control block scrutiny of algorithmic effects, skewing what can be studied at all.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core problem is structural: data gatekeeping plus weak COI norms lets a small industry-linked network shape an entire research agenda.
- Impact: Policymakers and media may over-index on industry-tied findings, while independent, critical work struggles for data, publication, and visibility.
- Watch next: Journal-wide COI audits, standardized public COI registries, and regulation tying platform data-access and experiment reporting to user-scale interventions.
