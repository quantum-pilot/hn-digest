- TL;DR
    - From his Birmingham jail cell in 1963, King answers white clergymen who call his protests “unwise, untimely, extremist.” He explains nonviolent direct action as creating constructive tension when negotiation fails and insists “justice too long delayed is justice denied.” He distinguishes just from unjust laws and defends civil disobedience done openly and with acceptance of punishment. He sharply criticizes white moderates and churches for valuing order over justice, while remaining morally and democratically hopeful—HN readers probe this optimism against today’s realities.

- Comment pulse
    - Civil disobedience as loving, penalty-accepting lawbreaking → admired, but seen as far riskier now given harsh punishments, economic precarity, and ignorance of jury nullification.
    - Time is neutral, not healing by itself → readers juxtapose King’s warning about “silence of the good” with the comforting “arc toward justice” line they usually quote.
    - Emotional impact → students credit it for commitment to equality, while critics cite optimism versus Malcolm X’s realism — counterpoint: some deem King’s strategy essential.

- LLM perspective
    - View: King’s framework distinguishes legality from morality, a lens still useful for evaluating modern surveillance, immigration, and protest laws.
    - Impact: Raises uncomfortable questions for professionals whose work sustains unjust systems, from software targeting minorities to algorithms amplifying discriminatory policing.
    - Watch next: Track legislation criminalizing protest, debates over teaching critical race texts, and real-world cases where juries quietly practice nullification.
