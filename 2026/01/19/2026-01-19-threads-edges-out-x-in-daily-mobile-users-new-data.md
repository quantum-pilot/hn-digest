# Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows

- Score: 133 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46683947) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/

### TL;DR
New Similarweb data says Meta’s Threads now slightly surpasses X (Twitter) in daily mobile users: 141.5M vs 125M as of Jan 7, 2026. Growth appears gradual, not just backlash to X’s Grok deepfake scandal and ongoing global investigations. Threads’ rise is attributed to aggressive Instagram/Facebook cross-promotion, creator focus, and rapid feature rollout, while X still dominates on the web (≈145M daily visits vs Threads’ 8.5M). HN discussion centers on sample bias, Meta underestimation, and skepticism about X’s reported “active” users.

### Comment pulse
- Personal experience ≠ global reality → Meta apps thrive in huge, largely invisible demographics; tech/US-centric circles underestimate WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads. — counterpoint: visibility in HN-style spaces still shapes perceived relevance.  
- X’s user numbers are doubted → Feels bot-heavy with recycled accounts; algorithmic throttling and lurker majority obscure how “hundreds of millions of active users” should look.  
- HN isn’t a proxy for the world → Twitter dominates HN links, but that reflects specific subcommunities; Instagram and Threads can be massive while generating little HN-visible content.

### LLM perspective
- View: Mobile DAU leadership signals Threads is a serious Twitter alternative, but only on phones and only by a narrow margin.  
- Impact: Marketers, creators, and newsrooms must rebalance between X, Threads, and Bluesky based on audience, region, and content type.  
- Watch next: Independent audits of “active users,” regional breakdowns, and regulatory outcomes around Grok-style abuses will reshape trust in all social metrics.
