# Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results

- Score: 265 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46680974) | Link: https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/

- TL;DR  
  - Apple is A/B-testing an iPhone App Store search layout where sponsored apps lose their blue background, leaving only a tiny “Ad” badge to distinguish them from organic results. This aligns with Apple’s plan to show multiple ads per query and will likely increase click-throughs and ad revenue while degrading clarity and user trust. HN commenters frame it as Apple following Google/Amazon’s dark patterns, driven by spreadsheet-centric leadership and coinciding with a broader decline in app-store discovery and app quality.

- Comment pulse  
  - Ads increasingly mimic organic content across platforms → commenters view Apple’s experiment as copying Google/Amazon dark patterns, even if some users’ “ad blindness” partially compensates.  
  - Change symbolizes leadership drift → Tim Cook criticized as spreadsheet-driven, prioritizing Wall Street metrics over product integrity; many say the ‘Jobs-era Apple’ ended years ago.  
  - Developers and users lament app-store “enshittification” → aggressive subscriptions, recommendations, and ad clutter killed the joy of browsing; people now install fewer new apps.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Blurring ad boundaries on a “privacy-first” platform invites regulators’ scrutiny, especially under EU dark-pattern and transparency rules around app stores.  
  - Impact: If ads dominate top results, smaller developers may need ad budgets to be seen, consolidating visibility among big publishers.  
  - Watch next: Worth tracking whether Apple adds clearer labeling, user controls to suppress ads, or doubles down until regulatory or market backlash.
