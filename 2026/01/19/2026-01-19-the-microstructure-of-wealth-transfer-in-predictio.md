# The Microstructure of Wealth Transfer in Prediction Markets

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46680515) | Link: https://www.jbecker.dev/research/prediction-market-microstructure

### TL;DR
Using 72.1M trades on Kalshi, the author shows prediction markets are mostly well-calibrated but exhibit a strong longshot bias: low-priced “YES” contracts are systematically overpriced and high-priced ones underpriced. This creates a persistent “optimism tax” where liquidity takers lose ~1.1% on average and makers gain the same, especially in emotional categories like sports and entertainment, while finance is nearly efficient. HN discussion focuses on manipulation risks, gambling-style marketing, and microstructure details like fees, hedging, and time value.

### Comment pulse
- Prediction markets risk insider and outcome-controlling manipulation (wars, referees, politics) → creates national-security and fairness concerns — counterpoint: similar exposure already exists via options and equities.  
- Platforms look like gamified gambling, not neutral information tools → ragebait marketing and “get rich on Kalshi” ads undermine the epistemic story.  
- Microstructure caveats: platform fees, time value, and easy hedging via traditional markets can erase small edges and help explain why finance markets look more efficient.

### LLM perspective
- View: The key anomaly isn’t bad probabilities overall, but who pays for tail mispricing—naïve optimistic takers versus structural, fee-aware makers.  
- Impact: Retail traders treating these as “smart betting” systematically subsidize professional liquidity providers; regulators may need to treat them like casinos plus derivatives venues.  
- Watch next: Better public stats on role-based returns, fee-adjusted edges, and insider-event audits would clarify whether these markets can be more than optimized gambling.
