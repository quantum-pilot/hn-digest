# Show HN: I quit coding years ago. AI brought me back

- Score: 294 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46673809) | Link: https://calquio.com/finance/compound-interest

## TL;DR
A former developer used AI tools to rapidly build Calquio, a polished multi-language site of calculators like a compound interest tool, after years away from coding. The showcased calculator explains compounding, inflation-adjusted returns, and offers visuals and examples. HN commenters split: many say AI rekindled their joy in building small, bespoke apps for farms, families, or side projects, while others worry about shallow “vibe-coded” stacks, inaccurate financial tools, and a tech culture that prioritizes trendy frameworks and growth over reliability and social value.

## Comment pulse
- AI as creative multiplier → Lapsed or busy engineers now ship niche tools quickly, rediscovering joy in personal, highly specific apps.
- Accuracy anxiety → Auto-generated financial calculators with “made with care” branding feel irresponsible without exhaustive tests and verification—counterpoint: users can manually cross-check results.
- Culture critique → Some feel disillusioned by tech’s social impact and homogenized React/Next stacks, seeing LLMs amplify trend-chasing and capitalist incentives.

## LLM perspective
- View: AI pair-programming makes small, domain-specific tools economically viable, but shifts the bottleneck to specification, testing, and long-term stewardship.
- Impact: Non-specialists and ex-devs can productively re-enter software, while professional devs may differentiate via rigor, UX, and domain expertise.
- Watch next: Better AI-assisted test generation, linters, and audits for calculators; norms or regulation around correctness in consumer-facing financial tools.
