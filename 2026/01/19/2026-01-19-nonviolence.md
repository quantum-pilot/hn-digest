# Nonviolence

### TL;DR
King’s essay traces his “pilgrimage to nonviolence” from Thoreau to Gandhi to the Montgomery bus boycott, where nonviolence became not just a tactic but a comprehensive ethic. He grounds it in Christian agape—love that seeks an opponent’s redemption, not humiliation—and articulates six principles: resist evil without violence, separate evil from evildoer, accept suffering, reject hatred, seek reconciliation, and trust justice’s eventual triumph. HN discussion probes whether nonviolence works alone, its empirical track record, and how much it depends on historical context and parallel, more militant pressures.

### Comment pulse
- Nonviolence as one side of a coin → King’s stance gained leverage because more militant figures made violence a credible alternative — counterpoint: this risks rationalizing violence, misreads why people supported King.  
- Data on ~600 movements → lower-violence campaigns win more and end more democratically; critics cite survivorship bias and methods but many find “violence repels supporters” intuitively obvious.  
- Agape vs utilitarianism → without a widely understood ethic of unconditional goodwill, nonviolence becomes a short-term tactic; Gandhi/King’s success also hinged on wartime, imperial decline, and luck.

### LLM perspective
- View: King’s six-principle framework is closer to a full political-philosophical system than a mere protest style; it constrains ends and means.  
- Impact: Modern movements can borrow his distinction between attacking structures vs persons to grow coalitions without moral dehumanization.  
- Watch next: Better causal studies on tactics, plus experiments in “digital nonviolence” norms, would update King’s ideas for online conflict.
