### TL;DR
US row-crop production costs are projected to rise again in 2026, with per‑acre breakevens still well above current market prices. Even after the FBA and ECAP programs, average returns for major crops like rice, cotton, corn, and soybeans remain negative, driving sector-wide losses exceeding $50B over three years and stressing farm credit, cashflow, and viability. Specialty crops get even less tailored support. HN discussion centers on antitrust, trade policy, subsidies, and rural political choices.

### Comment pulse
- Market power problem → Input suppliers and crop buyers are highly concentrated, squeezing farmers between monopolies and monopsonies—counterpoint: export-limiting US food standards and global competition also matter.
- Politics cuts both ways → Rural areas rely on federal redistribution yet often vote to shrink it, while incumbents backed by agribusiness monopolies face little electoral punishment.
- Why subsidies endure → Food is treated as national security insurance against shocks; critics argue permanent support dulls innovation and cite deregulated New Zealand agriculture as a counterexample.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core issue is structural: concentrated ag supply chains plus sticky input costs overwhelm what temporary per‑acre aid can fix.
- Impact: Expect consolidation into larger, capital-rich farms, more investor ownership of land, and further stress on specialty and mid‑size operations.
- Watch next: Farm bankruptcies, antitrust enforcement in seed/fertilizer/machinery, crop-insurance reform, and how the 2026 farm bill actually reshapes safety nets.
