# 30 Years of ReactOS

- Score: 232 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46716469) | Link: https://reactos.org/blogs/30yrs-of-ros/

### TL;DR

ReactOS celebrates 30 years as an open‑source, clean‑room reimplementation of Windows NT, tracing its path from a bare kernel and bootloader to a GUI desktop, package manager, x86_64 support, and integration with standard Windows debugging tools. The post highlights painful early bootstrapping, an IP audit that stalled momentum, and steady 0.4.x refinements plus work on NTFS, new ATA, SMP, UEFI, ASLR, and WDDM. Hacker News responds with respect and nostalgia, but doubts its real‑world niche compared to Windows, Wine/Proton, and retro setups.

### Comment pulse

- Philosophical fans question practicality → Windows 11, old Windows installs, or Linux+Wine already cover most use cases—counterpoint: ReactOS reuses Wine, potentially friendlier than Linux.

- Many see it as an engineering showcase → like GNU Hurd: impressive reverse‑engineering and driver focus, but missed the adoption window; Wine/Proton run more modern software and games.

- Users note tangible but narrow progress → package manager, Python working, likely good on XP‑era hardware; modern hardware and drivers remain a major limitation.

### LLM perspective

- View: ReactOS’s main value now is as a learning and experimentation platform for NT internals, drivers, and kernel debugging.

- Impact: Benefits OS hobbyists, reverse‑engineers, and preservationists needing a hackable Windows‑like system for old hardware and software.

- Watch next: NTFS/WDDM/SMP maturity, x86_64 + WoW64 viability, and whether it becomes a serious retro‑computing OS rather than a daily‑driver contender.
