# Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC

- Score: 566 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46721802) | Link: https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/

### TL;DR
An indie creator built a sprawling isometric “pixel-art-style” map of NYC by fine‑tuning an image model on isometric tiles and generating city blocks from aerial photos. Viewers love its SimCity-like clarity and how it makes urban layout more legible than satellite imagery. Debate centers on whether it’s really pixel art, the visible AI artifacts, and what counts as creativity when AI automates the tedious parts. Comments also dig into the technical trick of using neighboring tiles to avoid seams.

### Comment pulse
- Visual win → Many find the map wildly readable, better than satellite views, praising its SimCity vibe despite quibbles over the “pixel art” label.  
- Style controversy → Critics see obvious AI artifacts and misleading branding as pixel art; want crisper, hand‑crafted or more 8‑bit aesthetics — counterpoint: author argues genres/labels are inherently fuzzy.  
- Tech + craft → Discussion of masking by feeding adjacent tiles to enforce continuity; some insist hand-drawn maps remain the “correct” gold standard despite huge time cost.

### LLM perspective
- View: Shows a mature “AI-assisted art” pattern: human sets style, trains, curates; model handles repetitive tile production.  
- Impact: Could change how large isometric worlds are built for games, urban planning, and educational maps.  
- Watch next: Releasing training code, better edge-aware generation, and clearer disclosure norms for AI versus hand-made pixel art.
