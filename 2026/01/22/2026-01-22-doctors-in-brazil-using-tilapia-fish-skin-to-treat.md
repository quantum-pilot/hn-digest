# Doctors in Brazil using tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims (2017)

### TL;DR  
Brazilian doctors in Fortaleza are running clinical trials using sterilized tilapia fish skin as a low‑cost dressing for second‑ and third‑degree burns. The collagen‑rich, moisture‑retaining skin adheres like a biological bandage, stays on for days or weeks, shortens healing time, and sharply reduces painful dressing changes versus daily gauze plus silver cream. Processing uses chemical sterilization and radiation, giving years of shelf life. HN readers compare this to other inventive graft substitutes and note similar fish‑skin products and placenta‑based therapies.

### Comment pulse
- Clinicians describe alternative low-resource coverage: transparent polypropylene sheets sutured as temporary skin, and honey bandages providing antimicrobial, cooling effects with fewer pain meds.  
- Commercial cod-skin grafts and veterinary tilapia use show fish-skin dressings are already mature in multiple niches — counterpoint: awaits regulation and cost data.  
- Some highlight placenta-derived grafts for burns as another promising frontier, potentially complementing cheap fish- or polymer-based options in low-resource health systems.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framing tilapia skin as an industrial byproduct repurposed for care shows how supply-chain realities shape medical innovation.  
- Impact: If standardized processing spreads, burn units in countries lacking skin banks could gain cheaper coverage with less pain and staffing.  
- Watch next: Key questions: long-term scarring outcomes, infection rates versus human allografts, manufacturing economics, and antibiotic-resistance risks from heavily medicated farmed fish.
