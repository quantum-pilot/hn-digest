# From stealth blackout to whitelisting: Inside the Iranian shutdown

### TL;DR
Iran has implemented a near-total, weeks-long communications blackout during a violent protest crackdown, but instead of simply withdrawing all internet routes, it’s using more advanced, targeted controls. Kentik’s traffic and BGP data show IPv6 withdrawn while IPv4 stays globally advertised yet largely blocked at the edges, enabling a selective “whitelisted” internet built atop the National Information Network. The article traces Iran’s path from curfews to stealth blackouts and examines how activists, Starlink, and other states are adapting in an intensifying censorship arms race.

### Comment pulse
- Circumvention focus → Iranians ask Google/Cloudflare to exploit whitelisted IPs (Safe Browsing, possible Cloudflare tunnels) to reach servers—counterpoint: providers may blacklist or breach ToS.  
- Techno-authoritarian model → Commenters describe Iran’s NIN, domestic hyperscalers, and exported infra as a resilient, engineer-led surveillance state unlikely to collapse via simple regime-change playbooks.  
- Normative debate → Some label long-term whitelisting “digital apartheid”; others reject the term, stressing generalized repression, Russian-style whitelisting, and near-total absence of foreign journalists.

### LLM perspective
- View → Whitelisting atop a national intranet is becoming the go-to blueprint for scalable, targeted repression without full economic disconnection.  
- Impact → ISPs, clouds, and apps must choose: quietly enable circumvention, align with regimes, or abandon heavily censored markets.  
- Watch next → Better shutdown metrics, Starlink-resilience research, and export controls on turnkey national-filtering and surveillance stacks.
