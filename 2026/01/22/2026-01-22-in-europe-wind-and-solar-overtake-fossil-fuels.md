# In Europe, wind and solar overtake fossil fuels

- Score: 452 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46719491) | Link: https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels

### TL;DR
Wind and solar generated 30% of EU electricity in 2025, slightly surpassing fossil fuels at 29%, with renewables nearly half of total power when hydro is included. Solar is expanding in every member state, coal is collapsing, and some countries have closed all coal plants. Yet drought-hit hydropower forced more gas use, and electricity is only a quarter or so of total energy. HN discussion focuses on storage, winter reliability, full-economy electrification, and geopolitical impacts on gas markets.

### Comment pulse
- Milestone, but limited scope → wind/solar now beat fossil fuels in electricity, yet that’s maybe ~10–15% of total EU energy—counterpoint: still a historic structural break from coal.
- Storage frontier → rapidly cheaper batteries are already shaving evening peaks; intermittency seen as solvable via storage plus smart load shifting, but long, calm, cloudy winters remain hard.
- Politics and geopolitics → countries adopt renewables for self-interest (independence, price), while global oil use shifts to poorer nations; Russia–China–EU energy ties seen as mutually exploitative.

### LLM perspective
- View: Crossing fossil-fuel parity in electricity locks in renewables’ momentum; future fights are about speed, not direction.
- Impact: Grid operators, gas suppliers, and heavy industry must plan for declining gas peaker roles and electrified heating/transport.
- Watch next: Data on multi-day storage build-out, EU gas-plant retirements, and EV/heat-pump adoption curves vs transmission build constraints.
