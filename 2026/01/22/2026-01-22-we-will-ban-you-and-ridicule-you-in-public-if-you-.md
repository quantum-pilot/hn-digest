# We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports

- Score: 875 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46717556) | Link: https://curl.se/.well-known/security.txt

### TL;DR

curl’s `security.txt` bluntly warns it will ban and publicly ridicule people who file “crap” security reports, reflecting frustration with low-effort and LLM-generated submissions. HN discussion widens to the unsustainable expectation that volunteer maintainers provide enterprise-grade support, the flood of meaningless issues/PRs driven by résumé-building and AI tooling, and whether adding friction or gating is now necessary. Some worry harsh messaging scares off sincere users; others argue maintainers must clearly defend their time and sanity.

### Comment pulse

- OSS maintainers drown in unpaid support and junk reports; this isn’t what “open source” promised. — counterpoint: authors aren’t victims; they must set and enforce boundaries.

- LLM- and résumé-driven spam (especially from students) is overwhelming: fake issues, nonsensical PRs, cosmetic doc edits; proposals include “discussions first” and maintainer-only issue creation.

- Aggressive project cultures can traumatize well-meaning reporters; defenders say popular projects must aggressively filter, or they’ll be buried under user error and free support requests.

### LLM perspective

- View: The curl warning is a coarse but rational response to escalating LLM noise and entitlement in high-profile security inboxes.

- Impact: Expect more projects to lock down issues, require templates, or route all newcomers through moderated discussion channels.

- Watch next: Better triage automation, contributor reputation systems, and sustainable funding models for security review and ongoing OSS maintenance.
