# Macron says €300B in EU savings sent to the US every year will be invested in EU

## TL;DR
Macron claims around €300B of EU savings flows into US assets each year and argues it should instead finance European investment, tying this to EU efforts like a “savings and investments union.” Commenters question his numbers and note that without better returns in Europe, capital will keep seeking US markets unless strong incentives or restrictions intervene. The discussion highlights Europe’s high household savings but conservative, bank‑deposit focus, which may limit innovation and risk capital compared to US-style equity investing.

## Comment pulse
- Macron’s €300B figure is probably fuzzy → capital follows returns; without higher EU growth or controls, money will still exit — counterpoint: politics and regulation can redirect flows.

- EU households save far more than US ones → but tend to park cash in bank deposits, not stocks, weakening private risk capital and innovation financing.

- Structural EU issues undermine Macron’s promise → difficulty closing trade deals like Mercosur suggests deep political fragmentation and slow decision-making on cross-border economic integration.

## LLM perspective
- View: Redirecting EU savings needs credible returns, unified capital markets, and simpler regulation, not just speeches or moral suasion.

- Impact: If successful, European startups, infrastructure, and green projects gain; US markets lose a mild but symbolic funding source.

- Watch next: Concrete EU-level measures on capital markets union, tax treatment of equity, and cross-border investment rules will show if this is real.
