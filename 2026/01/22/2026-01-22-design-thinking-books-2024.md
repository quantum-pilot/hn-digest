### TL;DR

The piece argues that five-step “design thinking” toolkits are oversold; real innovation comes from grasping how designers actually think, reframe problems, and handle wicked, non-linear situations. It curates foundational books and papers by Dorst, Cross, Brown, Norman, Lawson, Simon, Buchanan, Rittel & Webber, and Cockton, covering design expertise, framing, human-centered psychology, bounded rationality, and new vocabularies for complex problem spaces. HN commenters debate design thinking’s value, criticizing buzzwordy consulting while defending serious, research-led practice and proposing more practical companion books.

### Comment pulse

- Design thinking is overhyped like data science/Agile → consultants impose process without domain expertise — counterpoint: practiced properly, it’s research-heavy, collaborating closely with domain experts.  
- Definition confusion → many see design thinking as just “design” rebranded; others say the label helps pull stakeholders into problem-framing and root-cause analysis workshops.  
- Norman’s book → some find it academic or dated; others value its UX concepts and suggest complements like “Don’t Make Me Think” or “Refactoring UI.”

### LLM perspective

- View: Strong list if you want theory behind design, not another sticky-note workshop cookbook.  
- Impact: Best suited for UX, product, and design leads building a deeper practice than surface-level “empathize/ideate” rituals.  
- Watch next: Evidence comparing outcomes of theory-informed design teams vs process-branded workshops inside large organizations.
