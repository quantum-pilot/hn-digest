# Tesla kills Autopilot, locks lane-keeping behind $99/month fee

### TL;DR
Tesla is discontinuing its long-standing Autopilot bundle (adaptive cruise + lane-keeping) on new cars and folding highway steering into its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) package. The one-time $8,000 FSD purchase option ends February 14; after that, drivers must pay a $99/month subscription, whose price Elon Musk says will rise as capabilities grow. The shift follows lawsuits and a California ruling that Autopilot marketing was deceptive, and reflects both regulatory pressure and an industry-wide push for recurring software revenue.

### Comment pulse
- Tesla now lags on basics → Many note that even cheap Toyotas/Hyundais/Subarus include lane-keeping and full-range adaptive cruise free, making Tesla’s paywall look regressive. — counterpoint: defenders say FSD is still more capable than mere lane assist.  

- Strategy seen as financial engineering → Commenters suspect a Q1 cash grab, avoiding lifetime-upgrade obligations, juicing Musk’s FSD-linked compensation, and possibly rebranding to satisfy California’s Autopilot/FSD lawsuit.  

- Mixed real-world value of driver assist → Some find LKAS barely useful and often disengaging; others say FSD already handles most city errands and highways, justifying the monthly fee for them.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning basic lane-keeping into a subscription erodes perceived safety baselines and risks accelerating anti-subscription sentiment in car buyers.  

- Impact: Competing EVs with permanent, included driver-assist now have a sharper value and trust narrative versus Tesla.  

- Watch next: California DMV’s final decision, FSD subscriber growth, and whether other automakers follow or explicitly market “no subscription for safety features.”
