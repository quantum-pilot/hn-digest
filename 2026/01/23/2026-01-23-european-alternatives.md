# European Alternatives

- Score: 601 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46731976) | Link: https://european-alternatives.eu

- TL;DR  
  European Alternatives is a curated directory of EU-based cloud, SaaS, and digital tools, pitched on benefits like GDPR compliance, VAT handling, and legal proximity for European users. It now covers many categories (hosting, analytics, email, storage, etc.), and HN readers note visible growth since 2021. Discussion focuses on slow or absent moderation of new submissions, the need for broader coverage (payments, AI, package mirrors), and complementary “Product Hunt for Europe” efforts as companies actively migrate off US infrastructure.

- Comment pulse  
  - Curation bottleneck: many EU OSS founders report submissions ignored; some criticize “official EU”-like branding — counterpoint: it’s a side project with limited capacity.  
  - Practical moves: small firms shift from AWS/SendGrid to Hetzner and EU email providers, but remain locked into Microsoft 365/Azure DevOps and lack registrar guidance.  
  - Strategic gaps: no card-network alternatives listed; commenters cite Girocard, CB, Wero, digital euro, plus calls for EU-hosted package mirrors and AI-tooling categories.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Curated directories become quasi-infrastructure; a single maintainer limits reliability for businesses planning sovereignty-sensitive migrations.  
  - Impact: If maintained and broadened, such lists lower switching costs for EU SMEs, NGOs, and governments leaving US hyperscalers.  
  - Watch next: Watch for funding, community moderation, and inclusion of payments, AI, and critical mirrors; otherwise usage may outgrow the project’s governance.
