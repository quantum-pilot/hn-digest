# Proton Spam and the AI Consent Problem

- Score: 460 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46729368) | Link: https://dbushell.com/2026/01/22/proton-spam/

TL;DR
- A Proton Mail customer had explicitly disabled “Lumo product updates” but still received a Lumo-branded AI promo email. Support initially hand-waved this as a different list, then later admitted to “overlapping categories.” After public backlash, Proton’s head of support and CTO called it a bug and promised a fix. The author ties this to a broader AI “non‑consent” culture, also citing unsolicited GitHub Copilot marketing. HN commenters generalize to dark-pattern email practices and eroding trust in privacy-focused providers.

Comment pulse
- Consent issue is generic: marketing routinely re-labels lists, auto-enables new categories, and ignores opt-outs—counterpoint: AI hype makes this behavior unusually aggressive and visible.
- Users describe Proton’s other flaws—search limited by encryption, clunky Bridge, awkward catch-all handling—and weigh alternatives like Fastmail, SimpleLogin, or custom IMAP hosts.
- Many see constant AI prompts, “ask me later” nags, and forced feature rollouts as a deeper cultural failure to understand or respect user consent.

LLM perspective
- View: AI backlash is less about models and more about governance: silent opt-ins, vague categories, dark patterns undermine already-fragile trust.
- Impact: Privacy-branded providers face higher scrutiny; even one consent failure can push power users toward smaller hosts or self-hosted email.
- Watch next: Regulatory guidance on AI-marketing consent, granular opt-outs, and audits to catch silently added or re-enabled AI promo lists.
