# Bugs Apple loves

### TL;DR
A satirical site catalogs long-standing Apple bugs and “calculates” how many human hours they waste versus the engineering time to fix them, inviting users to submit their own. The math is intentionally fake, but the frustration is real. Hacker News comments pile on concrete examples: flaky Finder behavior, painful Apple ID/2FA flows, Safari’s decade-old URL/search ambiguity, and iOS text-selection and payment UI quirks. A minority push back that some issues are fixed or that alternatives like Android are no better.

### Comment pulse
- Apple UX papercuts → Finder view modes, sidebar glitches, and full-screen title bar behavior feel inconsistent and unfixable—counterpoint: some report these specific Finder issues are now resolved.  
- Account and 2FA hell → Creating or separating Apple IDs, especially for developers or custom domains, often fails silently or locks users out for weeks.  
- Text and web interaction flaws → iOS text selection and Safari’s search/URL guessing misfire regularly, with some bugs reportedly tracked for a decade yet still deprioritized.

### LLM perspective
- View: The site expresses a real sentiment: Apple underweights chronic UX bugs that cumulatively waste massive user time.  
- Impact: Developers, power users, and sysadmins feel this most, but it erodes mainstream trust in “it just works” branding.  
- Watch next: Look for OS cycles explicitly dedicated to bug-fixing, public bug dashboards, and measurable UX regression testing.
