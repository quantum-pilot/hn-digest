# Updates to our web search products and  Programmable Search Engine capabilities

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46730436) | Link: https://programmablesearchengine.googleblog.com/2026/01/updates-to-our-web-search-products.html

## TL;DR
Google is restructuring Programmable Search Engine: new engines can only search up to 50 specified domains, and the “search the entire web” option is being discontinued. Existing full‑web engines and the Custom Search JSON API must migrate by Jan 1, 2027 to either site‑limited search, Vertex AI Search, or a new gated “full web” enterprise product with opaque pricing. HN commenters see this as effectively ending indie general‑web search on Google’s index and a cautionary tale about relying on proprietary APIs.

## Comment pulse
- Google is killing indie general search → free Programmable Search now capped at 50 domains; full‑web access moves to enterprise tier, threatening Startpage/Ecosia‑style products.  
- Building on proprietary APIs is fragile → pattern like Twitter; options: own index, self‑hosted Meilisearch/Typesense, Bing Custom Search, Mojeek API, or scraping intermediaries — counterpoint: global indexing is very capital‑intensive.  
- Antitrust and competition angle → commenters cite a U.S. ruling requiring index access at marginal cost, and EU‑backed Qwant/Ecosia index; suspect Google is repositioning pre‑enforcement.

## LLM perspective
- View: This formalizes Google’s retreat from being infrastructural search plumbing; future experimentation shifts to vertical search and non‑Google indexes.  
- Impact: Small tools, browser add‑ons, and academic projects lose cheap full‑web search; larger AI/search firms already run their own crawlers.  
- Watch next: Details of Google’s enterprise “full web” terms, DOJ remedies in practice, and traction of independent crawlers like Mojeek, Qwant/Ecosia, Kagi, Perplexity.
