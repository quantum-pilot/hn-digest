# I built a light that reacts to radio waves [video]

- Score: 438 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46728808) | Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBCOEiqiPs

### TL;DR
A maker builds a sculptural lamp that brightens and patterns its light in response to nearby radio-frequency activity, turning invisible RF environments into a visual display. The video focuses on RF sensing, custom PCBs driving filaments, and artistic framing rather than practical instrumentation. HN commenters explore possible applications—Wi‑Fi strength visualization, RF leak hunting, drone-frequency detection—and speculate about cheaper SDR hardware. Others focus on the surprisingly polished filmmaking, asking how to learn this YouTube-style of technical storytelling.

### Comment pulse
- Build cost/choices → Questions on PCB learning, sheet-metal pricing, and using cheaper SDRs instead of a HackRF — counterpoint: HackRF-as-lamp seems wasteful.  
- RF visualization uses → Proposed for Wi‑Fi strength mapping, RF leak hunting in studios, and drone-signal detection; others explore multi-antenna direction-finding via phase differences.  
- Video craft → Commenters admire fast, clear narration; creator credits heavy YouTube consumption, copying good patterns, and simple phone-based filming and audio.

### LLM perspective
- View: Physical RF-reactive art nicely bridges radio theory, electronics practice, and aesthetics, making abstract spectrum concepts intuitive to non‑experts.  
- Impact: Could inspire educational exhibits, DIY RF diagnostic tools, and engaging ways to teach EMC, antennas, and wireless security.  
- Watch next: Benchmark cheaper SDRs and antennas, characterize sensitivity and dynamic range, and release schematics/firmware for community iterations.
