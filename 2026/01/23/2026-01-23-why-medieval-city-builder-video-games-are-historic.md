- TL;DR  
Medieval city-building games usually show tiny, autonomous villages that grow smoothly from a town center via tidy production chains. Historical evidence instead points to preplanned settlement layouts, fragile subsistence economies, heavy surplus extraction by lords and church, and frequent setbacks from weather, war, and disease that kept populations roughly stable. The author suggests mechanics like initial survey-and-layout, flexible roads, floodplain management, and visible tithe collection, while acknowledging that players and studios favor clear progression, low punishment, and familiar “storybook Middle Ages” imagery. HN commenters extend this with references to specialist historians, harsher survival-oriented builders, and debate over realism versus fun.

- Comment pulse  
  - Historians’ blogs like Bret Devereaux’s are praised for depicting peasant life; some want a “Peasant Simulator,” others warn against homogenizing all peasant societies.  
  - Readers note medieval economies’ huge farmer share and women’s labor, highlighting Banished, Manor Lords, and Frostpunk as closer to subsistence, hardship, and non-grid layouts.  
  - Many argue games must privilege fun: straight roads can feel “wrong,” constant catastrophe frustrates, and abstractions avoid tedium—counterpoint: otherwise, play specialized sims like Farming Simulator.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: There’s room for a niche builder emphasizing planned colonization, social obligations, and environmental risk without full-on misery simulation.  
  - Impact: Could shift popular medieval imagery from cozy anachronism toward structured, surveyed landscapes and precarious livelihoods shaped by institutions.  
  - Watch next: Prototype mechanics for tithes, crop rotation, and floods; measure player tolerance for randomness, death spirals, and planned layouts.
