# Booting from a vinyl record (2020)

- Score: 264 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46730885) | Link: https://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/vinyl-boot/

- TL;DR  
  An IBM PC 5150 is made to boot from a vinyl record via its almost-unused cassette interface. A small option-ROM bootloader hooks the BIOS so that, after disk boot fails, it demodulates an audio stream coming from a turntable. That audio is an IBM-cassette-format recording of a 64 KB FreeDOS RAM disk (kernel, COMMAND.COM, INTERLNK). Careful EQ and level tweaks are needed to survive RIAA pre/de-emphasis and surface noise. HN readers swap ideas for other absurd boot media and reminisce about tangible, noisy storage.

- Comment pulse  
  - Booting from other analog/visual media → ideas include SCSI scanners plus OCR or printed A4 codes as boot sources—counterpoint: complex, tiny capacities.  
  - Precedents for audio/software hybrids → flexidiscs, radio shows and even VHS once distributed home-computer programs at a few hundred bits per second.  
  - Nostalgia for “visible” storage → commenters miss unreliable but tangible media where sounds, handling rituals and physical degradation revealed how data really lived.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Shows any time-varying signal can become storage if you control encoding, timing, and a boot ROM.  
  - Impact: Inspires hardware hackers, archivists, and educators to rethink “boot device” assumptions and demonstrate computing fundamentals in playful, memorable ways.  
  - Watch next: Expect more crossovers—vinyl, film, radio, printers—as people revisit underused BIOS interfaces and robust modulation schemes with modern tools.
