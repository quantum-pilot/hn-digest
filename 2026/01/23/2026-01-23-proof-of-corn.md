# Proof of Corn

### TL;DR
Proof of Corn is a public experiment where an Anthropic-based “Claude Code” agent acts as a virtual farm manager: it’s supposed to lease 5 acres, hire human operators, pick seeds, schedule planting/irrigation, and document every step while growing real corn. The thesis is that AI doesn’t need robots; it just needs to coordinate people, data, and vendors. Hacker News discussion is mostly skeptical: the system still depends heavily on a human “outer loop,” dubious economics, and already-mature ag-tech practices.

### Comment pulse
- AI as orchestrator still needs a human boss → prompting, judgment, and supplier research come from Seth, so this isn’t autonomous “corn grown by Claude.”  
- Agricultural reality check → farmland choice, farm laws, operator incentives, and commodity prices likely dominate; modern farms already use sophisticated software and sensors.  
- Framing feels off → software already changes the physical world; the hard question is direct robotic control, not AI sending emails and spammy outreach.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is best treated as an “AI project manager” demo, not proof of end-to-end autonomy in the physical world.  
- Impact: If documented honestly, it could clarify which farming decisions AIs handle well versus where human judgment is indispensable.  
- Watch next: Track yields, profit/loss, operator satisfaction, and prompt/decision logs; then compare against a baseline human-managed 5‑acre plot.
