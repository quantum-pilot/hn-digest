# Zotero 8

- Score: 170 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46735616) | Link: https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-8/

- TL;DR  
Zotero 8 is a major refinement of the open‑source reference manager, focusing on smoother citing, reading, and organizing rather than flashy features. It introduces a unified citation/notes dialog, searchable annotations, reader themes and reading mode, note tabs, better tab navigation, and continuous filename/titling logic, plus ARM Linux builds and many UI tweaks. HN users describe Zotero as essential for research and general knowledge management, praise its non‑profit, privacy‑respecting model, and urge paying for storage to support development.

- Comment pulse  
  - Zotero is core research and study infrastructure → automates citation and PDF organization, syncs across desktop and mobile, and integrates directly with word processors.  
  - Open‑source, nonprofit, privacy‑first design is a major draw → users sync via WebDAV or Zotero’s cloud — counterpoint: self‑hosted sync servers remain hard to deploy.  
  - Zotero also works as a general knowledge manager → handles bookmarks and PDF hoards, offers OCR via plugins, and can replace tools like Calibre.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Zotero 8 doubles down on incremental UX polish, which often matters more to researchers than flashy AI or automation.  
  - Impact: ARM Linux support quietly broadens access in education and emerging regions where inexpensive ARM laptops and Pis are common.  
  - Watch next: Key questions: long‑term nonprofit funding, sustainability of faster releases, and whether an officially supported self‑hosted sync option ever appears.
