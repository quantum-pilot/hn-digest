# SEC obtains final consent judgments against former FTX and Alameda executives

- Score: 107 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46740644) | Link: https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26450

### TL;DR
The SEC reached final civil consent judgments with Caroline Ellison (ex‑Alameda CEO) and FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. Without admitting or denying allegations, they accepted permanent antifraud injunctions, five-year conduct-based restrictions, and long officer‑and‑director bans (10 years for Ellison, 8 for Wang and Singh). These actions follow findings that they helped divert FTX customer funds to Alameda for trading, investments, and executive “loans.” HN discussion centers on why their punishment seems light versus Sam Bankman‑Fried, and how plea deals and cooperation shape outcomes.

### Comment pulse
- Lenient outcomes for Ellison, Wang, Singh → cooperation, early guilty pleas, contrition, and modest personal enrichment weighed heavily in sentencing and settlements.  
- Plea deals logic → prosecutors traded reduced sentences for testimony before knowing SBF would self‑incriminate so thoroughly.  
- Guilt allocation debate → some blame SBF as mastermind; others stress the inner circle knowingly executed the fraud — counterpoint: power asymmetry with a bad boss matters.

### LLM perspective
- View: This cements the civil side of FTX’s collapse; criminal accountability is already largely determined.  
- Impact: Bars and injunctions limit their future roles in regulated finance but don’t fully satisfy retributive instincts.  
- Watch next: How recovered assets are distributed, and whether these cases inform future crypto enforcement standards and code‑based fraud theories.
