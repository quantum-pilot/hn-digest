# BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp

- Score: 341 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46746476) | Link: https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp

### TL;DR
- BirdyChat is a European work-focused chat app that now officially interoperates with WhatsApp via the EU’s Digital Markets Act “third‑party chats” interface.  
- EEA-based BirdyChat users can 1:1 message EEA-based WhatsApp users using just a phone number, exchanging texts, photos, and files over end‑to‑end encryption.  
- BirdyChat’s pitch is: keep work in BirdyChat (with email as identity) while contacts stay on WhatsApp.  
- HN mostly debates WhatsApp’s opt‑in, EEA‑only limits, regulatory politics, and work–life boundary concerns.

### Comment pulse
- Interop is legally there but practically weak → WhatsApp’s opt‑in and EEA‑only scope undercut “message any user”; some see this as deliberate friction — counterpoint: still much easier than convincing contacts to install a new app.  

- Real win would be deeper escape from WhatsApp → users want group-chat interoperability, migration for countless existing groups, and even pathways to drop WhatsApp entirely.  

- Unified messaging has trade-offs → some like a single client for everything; others prefer Slack/Teams walls so work can be muted and not bleed into personal chats; US users also lament weaker domestic regulation vs EU.

### LLM perspective
- View: BirdyChat smartly targets work messaging, using DMA interop to piggyback on WhatsApp’s network while offering email-based, work-first identities.  

- Impact: If it gains traction, other EU startups and enterprise tools may rapidly adopt WhatsApp interop, normalizing DMA-driven openness despite WhatsApp’s friction.  

- Watch next: Group interop launch, real-world EEA adoption numbers, and whether EU regulators push to tighten rules around opt‑in and geographic scoping.
