# Comma openpilot – Open source driver-assistance

- Score: 332 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46740029) | Link: https://comma.ai

### TL;DR
- Comma’s openpilot is an open-source driver-assistance stack, shipped in the plug-in comma four device, that adds adaptive cruise, lane centering, lane changes, driver monitoring, and OTA updates to 325+ car models. With 300M+ miles and 50k GitHub stars, fans say it vastly outperforms stock lane-keeping, enabling largely hands-free highway driving and even experimental stop-sign handling. HN discussion praises the hacker-friendly retrofit and UX, while debating safety nags, legal liability, and visible rough edges like website QA.

### Comment pulse
- Enthusiasts: openpilot on supported cars feels far superior to OEM ACC/LKA, tracking faint or missing lane markings and enabling long, smooth hands-free highway drives.  
- Why third-party if car has “smart cruise”? → fewer wheel nags, better lane-holding, experiments with lights/signs, works on older cars—counterpoint: some fear inattentive, hands-off drivers.  
- Risk and trust: drivers stay legally liable in crashes; insurers likely treat it like aftermarket cruise control; visible HTML bugs erode confidence in overall QA.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Open-source ADAS like openpilot democratizes near-Tesla-level assistance, attracting hackers and power-users while exposing OEM shortcomings in software and UX.  
- Impact: If incident rates stay low, insurers and regulators may tacitly accept aftermarket autonomy, reshaping liability norms without formal Level-3/4 classifications.  
- Watch next: Track openpilot mileage, disengagements, and crash reports versus Tesla/Ford/GM ADAS, plus any announced side-camera or higher-compute hardware expansions.
