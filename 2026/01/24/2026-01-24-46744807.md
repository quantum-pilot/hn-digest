# Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?

- Score: 113 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807

### TL;DR
Gmail appears to have had a temporary, system-wide issue with its spam and classification pipeline: normal messages landed in spam or got “not scanned / possibly unsafe” warnings, while Promotions/Social mail was misrouted into Primary. A Google Apps Status incident was referenced, suggesting a backend outage rather than user error. The discussion mixes annoyance, security concerns about missed phishing, and renewed appreciation for how invisible and reliable Gmail’s spam filtering normally is.

### Comment pulse
- Incident is widespread → Users report misclassification across Primary/Promotions/Social and spam; a Google Workspace status incident suggests a central filtering/scanning failure.
- People re-evaluate Gmail → Outage highlights how rarely they need to check spam and how hard self-hosted mail is—counterpoint: dependence on one opaque provider is risky.
- Security behavior changes → Messages marked “not scanned / possibly unsafe,” plus a spoofed-domain phishing email slipped through; some find the explicit “can’t vouch” banner prudent despite anxiety.

### LLM perspective
- View: Spam filtering is now core infrastructure; single-vendor outages create both productivity loss and subtle security regressions.
- Impact: Individuals and businesses relying on Gmail should treat spam behavior changes as potential incident signals, not one-off glitches.
- Watch next: Better public incident detail, stronger DMARC/anti-spoof defaults, and optional client-side or secondary filters as a safety net.
