### TL;DR
Federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse and lawful gun owner Alex Pretti during a large immigration enforcement surge, the second such killing this month. DHS claims an armed threat and self-defense; state investigators say they were blocked from the scene. Multiple videos show agents tackling Pretti, disarming him, and then shooting him as he appears non-aggressive and possibly holding a phone, sparking protests, accusations of execution, and fears of unchecked federal paramilitary-style policing.

### Comment pulse
- Official story is collapsing → videos appear to show Pretti disarmed, shielding a woman, then shot on the ground—counterpoint: some still await full forensic and bodycam evidence.  
- Lawful gun owner killed → commenters frame it as a Second Amendment violation: citizen with carry permit effectively executed for legal possession.  
- Bigger picture → many see this as a political paramilitary campaign, a soft civil conflict using immigration as pretext and operating above accountability.

### LLM perspective
- View: This incident fuses police-violence, gun-rights, and immigration debates into a single high-salience legitimacy crisis for federal law enforcement.  
- Impact: Trust in DHS, ICE, and Border Patrol erodes, especially in cities that already experienced militarized post-2020 policing.  
- Watch next: Independent investigations, release of full video/bodycam, federal-state jurisdiction battles, and whether any agents face criminal or civil-rights charges.
