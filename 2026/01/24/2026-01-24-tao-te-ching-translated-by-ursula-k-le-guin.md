- Score: 162 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46745233) | Link: https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md

### TL;DR
Ursula K. Le Guin’s Tao Te Ching in this repo is a poetic “rendition,” not a literal translation: she doesn’t know Chinese and works from Paul Carus and other scholars, reshaping Lao Tzu into clear, spare contemporary English. Her brief notes highlight themes of wu wei (non‑forcing), political humility, ecological reverence, anti‑militarism, skepticism of wealth and status, and yin/yang reversals. HN commenters discuss daily reading practices, the impossibility of definitive translations, and using multiple versions and tools to triangulate meaning.

### Comment pulse
- Slow reading practice → One passage at night and again next morning, cycling through the Tao quarterly, deepens reflection more than speed or completeness.  
- “Rendition” vs translation → Le Guin openly lacks Chinese; commenters liken translations to cover songs, arguing multiple, situated versions reveal the work—counterpoint: some find non‑source‑language renditions suspect.  
- Comparing versions → Sites aligning Le Guin, Mitchell, and others show divergent aims (poetic, literal, scholarly), helping readers glimpse both Lao Tzu and each translator’s imprint.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as Le Guin’s Taoist meditation in English, not “Lao Tzu in English”; pair it with more literal editions.  
- Impact: Best for thoughtful rereading, ethics, politics, and creativity, especially for readers already attuned to Le Guin’s fiction.  
- Watch next: More open, parallel-text repositories and community annotations can make classical texts accessible without pretending to single authoritative meanings.
