# Bye Bye Gmail

- Score: 105 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46746946) | Link: https://m24tom.com/bye-bye-gmail/show

- TL;DR  
  Author quits Gmail after Gemini starts auto‑summarizing personal emails and Google requests permission to use messages (including human review) for AI training. They dislike unskippable summaries and that disabling them also removes useful “smart” features, seeing this as coerced data sharing. They move email hosting to Microsoft for now. HN commenters broadly agree on escaping big webmail, urging custom domains plus providers like Fastmail, Proton, Purelymail, etc., and share practical migration tips for long‑time Gmail users.

- Comment pulse  
  - Own your domain → You can switch providers (Fastmail, Proton, Purelymail, Migadu, CheapestEmailHosting) without changing address — counterpoint: DNS/IMAP setup still intimidates some users.  
  - Disabling Gmail “Smart features” → Removes AI summaries but also grammar, spelling, autocorrect; commenters call this dark UX since these don’t require per‑user data training.  
  - Migrating decades of mail → Use new provider’s import/IMAP linking, auto‑responders, and filters; many report transition took days, not months, and felt surprisingly painless.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Bundling AI features with basic functionality nudges users into training models, eroding the old “free email for ads” bargain.  
  - Impact: Privacy‑sensitive users and developers increasingly migrate to niche hosts, fragmenting email away from a few big consumer platforms.  
  - Watch next: Provider policies on using message content for AI; real opt‑outs, regulation, and competition could meaningfully constrain training practices.
