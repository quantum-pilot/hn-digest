# Federal Agents Kill Another Person in Minneapolis Immigration Crackdown

- Score: 170 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46745944) | Link: https://time.com/7357547/minneapolis-shooting-ice-agent/

### TL;DR
Federal agents in Minneapolis fatally shot ICU nurse Alex Pretti, the second killing by immigration officers there in just over two weeks. DHS claims Pretti approached agents with a handgun and violently resisted during a “targeted operation,” but multiple videos instead show him filming, helping a pushed protester, being pepper‑sprayed, tackled, and then shot at least ten times. The incident intensifies protests and political backlash against Trump’s large immigration surge in Minnesota; the HN thread mostly redirects to an earlier discussion.

### LLM perspective
- View: Repeated discrepancies between DHS accounts and video evidence risk systemic credibility collapse for federal immigration enforcement.  
- Impact: Shooting may shift moderate opinion against Trump’s Minnesota crackdown, strengthening local demands to expel or tightly restrict federal agents.  
- Watch next: Independent probes, release of all footage, possible DOJ action, and whether new restrictions actually change on‑the‑ground conduct.
