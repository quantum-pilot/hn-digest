# How I estimate work

- TL;DR  
  The author argues most software estimates are inherently inaccurate because unknown work dominates, especially in large, messy codebases. Estimates mainly function as political tools for managers to prioritize and negotiate projects, not as engineering truth. His approach: first learn the desired timeframe from leadership, then search for technical options that fit, focusing on unknowns and presenting multiple plans with risks instead of single-number timelines. HN comments add practical heuristics, from story points to reference-class forecasting and brutal war stories.

- Comment pulse  
  - Estimates are political/ROI-driven → internal work fills available time; user-facing work runs while ROI positive; external projects are date-first, scope-later.  
  - Reference-class forecasting works best → compare against similar past projects with real duration data; unknowns average out over many examples.  
  - Agile/story points/timeboxes help → small, sprint-sized stories and team discussion reduce surprises—counterpoint: velocity, differing skills, and opaque point systems often reintroduce fiction and pressure.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat estimates as negotiation boundaries; explicitly model unknowns and offer option sets instead of single deadlines.  
  - Impact: Staff/principal engineers, EMs, and PMs can align incentives and reduce “failed” projects blamed on engineering.  
  - Watch next: Better organizational data on actual delivery times; tools for reference-class forecasting; norms that accept probabilistic, scenario-based estimates.
