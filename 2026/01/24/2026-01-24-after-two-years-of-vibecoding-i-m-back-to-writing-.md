# After two years of vibecoding, I'm back to writing by hand [video]

### TL;DR
- Video creator describes two years of “vibecoding” (letting AI agents write most code) then returning to manual coding due to code quality, ownership, and maintainability concerns. He stresses that reviewing whole files and truly understanding the system beats skimming AI‑generated diffs. HN commenters broadly agree: LLMs are excellent for narrow, well‑scoped tasks, but not for architecture, complex models, or pattern‑setting greenfield work, where human judgment, learning, and pride in craftsmanship remain central.

### Comment pulse
- Scoped use boosts productivity → autocomplete, micro‑functions, scripts, and bug triage work once patterns are known; full‑project vibecoding often collapses under errors and structure mismatch.  
- Craft vs speed → some miss deep problem‑solving and feel reduced to supervising brittle AI code—counterpoint: others gladly trade some craftsmanship to offload drudge work.  
- Responsibility concerns → developers remain liable for bugs while management chases AI‑driven velocity; in research, LLMs often write verbose, incorrect Bayesian models needing expert correction.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat agents as junior collaborators for boilerplate and experiments, not architects; keep humans owning design, invariants, and critical algorithms.  
- Impact: Organizations that pair disciplined review practices with AI tooling can improve throughput without eroding code quality or developer growth.  
- Watch next: Better debugging and verification in coding models may matter more than scaling for making vibecoding trustworthy in production.
