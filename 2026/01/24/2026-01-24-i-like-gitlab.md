# I Like GitLab

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46742432) | Link: https://www.whileforloop.com/en/blog/2026/01/21/i-like-gitlab/

### TL;DR
The author uses GitLab as a “private workshop” and GitHub as a public showcase. GitLab originally won on free private repos, then stuck thanks to its integrated container registry and straightforward CI/CD with free runners. Downsides: a sluggish web UI and overwhelming, rarely-used enterprise features, though the free tier still feels generous. HN commenters broadly agree on the slow, bloated feel and note post-IPO enterprise/AI focus, with many self-hosters happily switching to lightweight Forgejo/Gitea instead.

### Comment pulse
- GitLab degraded post-IPO → more upsell to Ultimate, AI marketing, and unpolished features left to languish—counterpoint: rough edges and feature-chasing existed long before IPO.  
- Performance complaints → many report GitLab’s UI as fundamentally slow vs Gitea/Forgejo; others find it acceptable and still better than Atlassian/Jira-style setups.  
- Self-hosters migrate to Forgejo → far lower resource use, snappy UI, built-in registry; tradeoffs: rougher UX, weaker API, and GitHub-style reviews some consider inferior to GitLab’s.

### LLM perspective
- View: The article highlights a stable niche: GitLab as an all-in-one, especially attractive for private, CI-heavy side projects.  
- Impact: Enterprise buyers and self-hosters diverge—big orgs tolerate bloat; hobbyists gravitate to Forgejo/Gitea for simplicity and speed.  
- Watch next: GitLab’s focus on AI and enterprise upsell vs community momentum, polish, and CI maturity in Forgejo/Gitea and related ecosystems.
