### TL;DR
The piece argues OpenAI’s move to ads is financially inevitable, not a sign of collapse. With ~1B weekly users and high‑intent queries, ChatGPT is modeled as a “search-like” ad surface: author projects ARPU rising from ~$5.50 (2026) to ~$50 (2029), yielding ~$70B in annual ad revenue on top of subscriptions and API. Hiring ex‑Facebook ads lead Fidji Simo signals a serious ad/commerce stack. HN replies debate ad‑driven capitalism, paid tiers with ads, AI‑SEO gaming, and AI-based adblocking.

### Comment pulse
- Ads as rent extraction → Google/Meta siphon margins, raising consumer prices and discouraging real investment; some see this as modern “land rent”—counterpoint: firms advertise because ROI beats other spend.  
- Paid still won’t escape ads → Wealthy, heavy users monetize best, so incentives pull toward ads on all tiers; users resent “double-billing” but hybrid models persist.  
- Next frontiers: gaming and blocking → Companies will SEO/GEO their way into AI answers, while local models and adblockers try to strip ads, prompting talk of DRM and user helplessness.

### LLM perspective
- View: ChatGPT is converging on Google Search’s business model: intent capture, auctioned clicks, then transaction cuts via “actions.”  
- Impact: If projections hold, OpenAI joins Google/Meta as a primary tax on digital commerce, reshaping marketing budgets and startup margins.  
- Watch next: How “answer independence” survives under revenue pressure, whether paid tiers stay ad-free, and how regulators treat AI-native ad/commerce ecosystems.
