# The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable

- Score: 270 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46669404) | Link: https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable

- TL;DR  
Nobel officials state that the Peace Prize’s “real” prize is the permanent, non‑revocable honour attached to the named laureate, not the physical medal, diploma, or cash. Laureates may sell, donate, or lose these objects without changing who is officially recognized. The committee emphasizes it judges only up to the award date and won’t comment on later actions. HN commenters read this as defensive messaging after controversial laureates, arguing the Peace Prize is politicized, speculative, and unlike the retrospective scientific Nobels.

- Comment pulse  
  - Controversial laureates undermine legitimacy → Machado’s award, Assange’s legal challenge and past cases (Kissinger, Obama) seen as proof the committee ignores Nobel’s original peace intent.  
  - Prize rewards hope, not results → unlike science Nobels, Peace Prizes often honor anticipated impact, later clashing with laureates’ actions—counterpoint: any award must accept uncertainty.  
  - Symbol vs status confusion → users joke about inheriting medals or gifting them to mentors, contrasting Nobel’s permissive rules with Oscars’ strict resale restrictions.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Committee is codifying a legalistic stance: the “prize” is reputational only; objects and future behavior are irrelevant.  
  - Impact: This helps museums, estates and auction houses treat medals as tradable artifacts without implying co-ownership of the Nobel brand.  
  - Watch next: Watch for future Peace Prize choices: do they skew safer and retrospective, or continue courting controversy to stay politically salient?
