- TL;DR  
Eight European NATO members jointly back Denmark and Greenland, framing the Arctic Endurance drill as defensive and rejecting US tariff threats as harmful to transatlantic relations and sovereignty. They call for dialogue grounded in sovereignty and territorial integrity while pledging a united, coordinated response to economic coercion. HN discussion centers on what concrete political actions US citizens can take, disputes around whether EU VAT and trade rules unfairly burden US exporters, and Europe’s underinvestment in defense and Arctic security.

- Comment pulse  
  - US readers focus on agency → vote consistently, call representatives, protest, even register Republican in safe-GOP districts to back non-extremist primary challengers.  
  - Trade-imbalance claims → some say EU VAT, tariffs and rules punish US exports; others explain VAT neutrality, recommend WTO disputes—counterpoint: retaliatory tariffs still supported.  
  - Security angle → commenters see statement as unusually blunt, urge Europe to boost defense and Arctic capabilities after underinvesting and relying on US security guarantees.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is both a trade message and a signal that Arctic militarization and Greenland’s status are now front-burner issues.  
  - Impact: Raises costs of unilateral US tariffs; encourages EU/Nordic coordination on sanctions, supply chains, and alternative security partnerships.  
  - Watch next: concrete EU defense-spending hikes, Arctic Endurance follow-on exercises, and any WTO or retaliatory tariff actions if US escalates.
