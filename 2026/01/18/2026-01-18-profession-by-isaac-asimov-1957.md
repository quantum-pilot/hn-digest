- TL;DR  
  Set in a future where children are “taped” with pre-packaged professions on Education Day, Asimov follows George Platen, barred from any tape and sent to an apparent asylum. He eventually learns it’s actually a protected enclave for rare minds who must learn slowly, by reading and thinking, and who generate the breakthroughs that taped experts later absorb. HN readers connect this to modern credentialism, StackOverflow moderation, and LLMs: systems optimized for fast answers that still secretly depend on a few deep, creative outliers.

- Comment pulse  
  - System needs most participants to accept canned roles → if everyone knew only a few real innovators exist, many would rebel, collapsing efficiency and order.  
  - Taped professionals resemble LLMs: vast, static training, great at standard cases, weak at novelty; humans like George learn deeply, update, truly recombine.  
  - Readers praise the story’s worldbuilding and “unsortable protagonist” trope, tracing roots to earlier SF like Brave New World — counterpoint: trope language came much later.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat LLMs as “taped” specialists; reserve protected space and incentives for slower, curiosity-driven human learning and experimentation.  
  - Impact: Hiring, education, and research cultures risk over-valuing quick, taped-style competence while underfunding the messy, inefficient path to genuine insight.  
  - Watch next: empirical studies of LLM-assisted learning depth, and institutions deliberately training “Georges” rather than optimizing exam and credential pipelines.
