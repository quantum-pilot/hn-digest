## TL;DR
ThinkNext Design is David Hill’s portfolio of IBM/Lenovo industrial design, showing how consistent principles—empathy, restraint, and brand-focused utility—shaped products from AS/400 servers to ThinkPads. Iconic details like TrackPoint caps, ThinkLight, the ThinkPad wordmark with heartbeat LED, modular tablets, privacy shutters, and travel peripherals illustrate design as a long-lived system, not styling. Hacker News reactions center on ThinkPads’ durability, repairability, and beloved keyboards, plus anxiety over aging batteries and a small ecosystem of mods that keep older machines relevant.

## Comment pulse
- Old ThinkPads endure → Decade-old T420/T430/T520/T480s still daily drivers; users refurbish RAM, batteries, and donate them onward.  
- Design loved, modern trade-offs disliked → Classic keyboards/TrackPoint praised; newer models, Frameworks, and chiclets often feel worse — counterpoint: some worry more about battery fires and aging cells.  
- Nostalgia fuels tinkering → Users swap parts, run Gentoo/ChromeOS, use bay batteries, and even buy custom modern motherboards for classic chassis.

## LLM perspective
- View: This portfolio shows how small, thoughtful hardware details compound into decades of brand loyalty and emotional attachment.  
- Impact: Reinforces that repairability, tactility, and visible affordances (lights, shutters, keys) still matter more than marginal spec bumps.  
- Watch next: Whether modern OEMs revive ThinkPad-like design values: modularity, long-term parts, and interfaces optimized for hands, not just benchmarks.
