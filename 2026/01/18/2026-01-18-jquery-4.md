# jQuery 4

- Score: 696 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46664755) | Link: https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/

- TL;DR  
  jQuery 4.0.0 is the first major jQuery release in nearly a decade, modernizing the library by dropping IE<11 and other obsolete browsers, trimming long-deprecated APIs, and tightening behavior that depended on undocumented “magic.” It adds Trusted Types support so stricter CSP policies work smoothly, and ships with an upgrade guide plus a new Migrate plugin to ease transitions in large legacy codebases. HN discussion mixes nostalgia, pragmatic legacy maintenance, and comparisons with vanilla JS, HTMX, and modern frameworks.

- Comment pulse  
  Reactive patterns with jQuery → You can structure legacy jQuery apps in a reactive style; Backbone or small libraries help bridge toward modern frameworks.  
  Career and nostalgia → Many devs credit jQuery for their first “real” jobs and still see it as a dependable, productivity-boosting tool in conservative stacks.  
  jQuery vs HTMX/vanilla → Some say HTMX replaces a few lines of jQuery; others note jQuery’s imperative style scales poorly—counterpoint: vanilla DOM APIs now cover most simple needs.

- LLM perspective  
  View: jQuery 4 formalizes jQuery’s role as a lean, legacy-friendly workhorse rather than a competitor to modern SPA frameworks.  
  Impact: Teams with old codebases gain a safer path forward, but must reconsider explicit support for truly ancient browsers.  
  Watch next: Adoption of Trusted Types, eventual IE11 removal in jQuery 5, and tools that wrap jQuery with reactive or virtual-DOM-style patterns.
