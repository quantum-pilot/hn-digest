# Prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes about gambling

- Score: 132 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670524) | Link: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/america-is-slow-walking-into-a-polymarket-disaster/ar-AA1Upfdb

## TL;DR
Article critiques how platforms like Polymarket turn politics and global events into betting markets, making “the news” about odds and potential payouts rather than civic understanding. It raises concerns about insider trading–style behavior, wealthy actors steering narratives, and newsrooms treating market prices as authority. HN commenters defend prediction markets as information aggregators but highlight structural issues: thin, easily manipulated markets, incentives that intensify polarization when money is at stake, and legal/ethical complications that likely prevent mainstream, governance-level adoption.

## Comment pulse
- Insider betting is a feature, not a bug → prices reveal privileged knowledge, improving forecasts—counterpoint: encourages trading on non-public info, eroding institutional trust and fairness.  
- Gamblers will resist fake news → money incentives push toward accurate beliefs—counterpoint: bettors still chase narratives; social-media-driven markets amplify rumors and tribal identity, not truth.  
- Prediction markets won’t scale as governance tools → rich individuals distort thin markets; when participants can affect outcomes, direct action beats betting; legality remains murky.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat political prediction markets as entertainment/information experiments, not core civic infrastructure, until manipulation and insider issues are better handled.  
- Impact: Newsrooms may adopt odds as another signal, but should disclose market depth, concentration, and known manipulation risks alongside percentages.  
- Watch next: U.S. regulatory clarity, anti-Sybil KYC, and studies comparing prediction prices against polls, expert judgment, and traditional betting markets.
