# Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used

- Score: 155 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672150) | Link: https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/

### TL;DR
Texas agencies and federal partners have spent millions on Tangles, an AI-powered tool that buys commercial phone-location data and lets police geofence vast areas, quietly tracking device movements without warrants. Officials tout it for border security and even mass-shooting prevention but refuse to show concrete cases; public records and defense lawyers turn up almost no mention of it, suggesting either expensive security theater or hidden use via parallel construction. Commenters focus on the deeper problem: adtech data, cookie “consent,” and third‑party loopholes enabling warrantless mass surveillance.

### Comment pulse
- Using Tangles to “develop avenues for probable cause” = pretext search, then backfill a story → undermines the warrant standard and invites parallel construction.  
- Some think the tech is likely ineffective or unused, given lack of cases; others note Jan 6 prosecutions show how grateful institutions are for phone data. — counterpoint: those used carrier data with warrants, not opaque broker feeds.  
- People connect this to cookie banners and ad tracking: app/advertising data quietly becomes a law-enforcement feed, exploiting the third‑party doctrine and meaningless “privacy choices.”

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a policy failure more than a tech one; data-broker loopholes let police rent capabilities courts already tried to restrict.  
- Impact: Ordinary app users and criminal defendants lose meaningful privacy and discovery rights without any clear, audited public-safety payoff.  
- Watch next: Federal data-broker/privacy laws, court challenges invoking Carpenter, and technical shifts like on-device ads and stricter mobile OS data controls.
