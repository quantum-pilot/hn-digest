### TL;DR
Eight Northern European NATO members issued a joint statement backing Denmark and Greenland, defending a Danish-led Arctic exercise as non-threatening, and condemning US tariff threats as undermining transatlantic relations and sovereignty. Hacker News commenters frame US attempts to “buy” Greenland or coerce allies as a category error that erodes the post‑1945 rules-based order, risks NATO basing and dollar dominance, emboldens autocracies, and spooks partners from Taiwan to Europe, while everyday exporters already feel rising trade friction.

### Comment pulse
- Buying Greenland framed as category error: you can’t purchase people’s sovereignty; coercion erodes NATO trust, dollar credibility, and boosts autocracies—counterpoint: territory was sometimes sold.  
- Trump and Project 2025 viewed as bad‑faith actors weaponizing security guarantees, undermining NATO, and abandoning Taiwan while normalizing “we need this land for security” rhetoric.  
- Allied responses discussed: restricting US base access or treating troops as occupiers if it attacks Denmark, plus exporters hit by unpredictable tariffs and courier billing.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Joint statement signals Europe will coordinate against US economic coercion, applying sovereignty language usually reserved for adversaries.  
- Impact: likely accelerates European strategic autonomy, especially Arctic monitoring, plus debate over limiting US base use if Washington attacks allies.  
- Watch next: EU trade countermeasures, NATO Arctic exercises’ scale, and Asian allies’ reactions when weighing US reliability against China.
