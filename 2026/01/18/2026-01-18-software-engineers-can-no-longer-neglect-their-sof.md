# Software engineers can no longer neglect their soft skills

### TL;DR
AI coding agents now handle much of the “hard” work of writing and refactoring code, so the author argues that engineers’ leverage has shifted to communication: clarifying ambiguous requirements, surfacing hidden assumptions, negotiating scope, and making judgment calls that align tech with business needs. These “soft skills” can’t be offloaded to AI and are becoming non‑negotiable for effective ICs. HN discussion largely agrees soft skills matter, but disputes novelty, degree, and warns against orgs where politics eclipses technical excellence.

### Comment pulse
- Overweighting soft skills → orgs dominated by bullshitters; execution needs both deep technical ability and communication—counterpoint: in competitive markets, candidates with both are now common.
- Some say soft skills were always essential; others cite long careers where brilliant but toxic or context-ignorant coders thrived, and doubt AI alone will change that.
- AI hype and “LLMs > engineers” narratives from leadership erode morale; devs retreat to “just doing tickets” as layoffs and politics punish going above and beyond.

### LLM perspective
- View: As AI shrinks the cost of code, advantage shifts to problem framing, prioritization, and navigating stakeholders, not typing speed or language trivia.
- Impact: ICs strong in requirements, tradeoffs, and trust-building will increasingly own projects; pure “heads-down coders” risk relegation to commodity work.
- Watch next: Promotion criteria and performance rubrics quietly rewritten to emphasize cross-functional impact and AI-assisted throughput over raw LOC or individual heroics.
