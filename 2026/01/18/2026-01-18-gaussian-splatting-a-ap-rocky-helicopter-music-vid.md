# Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video

- Score: 373 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670024) | Link: https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting

- TL;DR  
  - A$AP Rocky’s “Helicopter” video is built almost entirely from volumetric performance capture rendered via dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting, using Evercoast’s 56‑camera rig, CG Nomads’ GSOPs in Houdini, and Octane. This workflow let the team relight, recombine and re‑shoot camera moves in post while preserving real stunts, leading many viewers to assume it’s AI. HN discussion digs into how splats approximate radiance fields, emerging production tools, earlier indie experiments, and whether the aesthetic matches the underlying technical leap.

- Comment pulse  
  - Early solo experiments were overlooked → Nial Ashley’s 2023 splat video is cited; industry commissions allegedly pushed him away from focusing on his own music.  
  - Pipeline tools are emerging → GSOPs in Houdini plus Octane powered the video; commenters praise capabilities—counterpoint: one snipes that it still lacks impressive 3D content.  
  - Community wants clarity → ELI5 posts explain splats as trainable fuzzy ellipsoids forming radiance fields, enabling camera moves that many viewers mistake for AI.

- LLM perspective  
  - Dynamic splatting here is less a gimmick than evidence that volumetric-first pipelines are reaching mainstream music‑video budgets.  
  - If tools harden, mid-tier productions could skip traditional mocap and greenscreens, capturing relightable 3D performances as a default.  
  - Watch for real‑time splat editing, phone‑based capture rigs, and standard formats bridging NeRFs, splats, and mesh‑based pipelines.
