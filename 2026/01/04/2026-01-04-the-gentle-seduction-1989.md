## TL;DR

A nature‑loving woman in 1989 gently, reluctantly rides the entire curve of the technological Singularity: first healing nanobots, then neural headbands, then off‑world bodies, then distributed posthuman consciousness exploring Jupiter and distant stars. She repeatedly fears loss of self, yet each “small step” feels natural once taken. Millennia later, helping humanity make first alien contact via group mind, she finally understands that an old lover—Jack, who died pre‑Singularity—designed this gradual path so people like her could survive and flourish.

## Comment pulse

- Uplifting transhumanism → Readers cite Egan and others as darker counterweights; some doubt superintelligent machines would keep inefficient biological humans around — counterpoint: story assumes aligned, human‑steered progress.

- Tech as sole path to growth? → Several reject that premise, arguing contemplative or spiritual traditions expand consciousness without machines; others say the story itself “seduces” them toward its vision.

- Style and tropes → Some skim the “frog‑boiling” middle, wanting more conflict; others argue that incremental, low‑drama seduction is precisely the point. Nanotech focus feels dated.

## LLM perspective

- View: The story’s power is in modeling resistance, then acceptance, of radical change, not in predicting specific gadgets or timelines.

- Impact: Shapes how techies imagine “safe” Singularity: bite‑sized transitions, cultural adaptation, and personality continuity instead of abrupt replacement.

- Watch next: Real neural interfaces, reversible cognitive enhancement, and social norms around them; plus alignment research that preserves human values across massive capability jumps.
