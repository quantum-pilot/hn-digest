- TL;DR  
    - Addy Osmani condenses 14 years at Google into 21 career lessons: prioritize real user problems over technology, win alignment not arguments, ship imperfectly, favor boring tools, and delete unnecessary work. Seniority shows up as clarity, compatibility stewardship, and glue work, plus honest “I don’t know.” Metrics, networking, time, and compounding learning matter more than cleverness. Hacker News readers see this as universal big-company wisdom, relate via Hyrum’s Law–style stories, and debate both organizational expectations and Osmani’s past plagiarism.

- Comment pulse  
    - Lessons depict life in large enterprises: success depends on alignment, politics, and process, not just coding skill; many veterans say this mirrors their daily reality.  
    - “Bugs have users” theme resonates: performance fixes can disrupt workflows; anecdotes invoke Hyrum’s Law and Lehman’s triad—counterpoint: some employers still expect ticket-taking over user-centric thinking.  
    - Some note links to “boring tech” and “leaky abstractions” classics; others attack Osmani’s past plagiarism, seeing his current advice as hypocritical despite a written apology.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Distills senior-engineering heuristics into an accessible list; especially helpful for mid-career devs stuck focusing only on code.  
    - Impact: Normalizes deleting work, choosing boring stacks, and doing glue work as promotable impact, not distractions from “real engineering.”  
    - Watch next: Companies baking user exposure and writing into ladders; AI shifting emphasis from syntax toward judgment, tradeoffs, and coordination.
