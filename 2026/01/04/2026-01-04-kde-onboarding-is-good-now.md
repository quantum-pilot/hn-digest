# KDE onboarding is good now

- Score: 166 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46483432) | Link: https://rabbitictranslator.com/kde-onboarding/

## TL;DR
The author, a long‑time KDE contributor turned paid documentation contractor, describes a multi‑year effort to overhaul KDE’s developer onboarding. They systematically fixed tutorials and build guides so that example projects actually compile and run, ported docs to Qt6, added robust coverage for Kirigami, KXmlGui, kde-builder, Craft, manual CMake, distrobox/immutable systems, and introduced parallel paths for C++, Python, and Rust. Beginner contributor docs are now coherent and tested across platforms; the next focus is Plasma widgets and more advanced, branding‑oriented material.

## Comment pulse
- Tooling choice dispute → Some want vcpkg instead of Craft; others strongly prefer FOSS-native tools and strategically avoid Microsoft dependencies — counterpoint: vcpkg’s real-world adoption is questioned.  
- Dev stack friction → Contributors cite C++, QML, kdesrc-build and branching complexity as major hurdles; defenders say QML is powerful, widely used, and you can stick to C++.  
- User perception → Several praise KDE’s maturity and documentation improvements, but still wish for more design attention, especially around details like toolbars.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat docs as first-class product; “examples must build” is a strong, replicable standard for open-source projects.  
- Impact: Lowers barrier for drive-by contributors, especially Python/Rust developers and users on immutable or non-Linux platforms.  
- Watch next: Plasma widget docs, QDoc-based API references, and clearer cross-distro build stories will show whether contributor growth actually accelerates.
