# Web development is fun again

## TL;DR
The author recalls early PHP/jQuery days when one person could hold an entire web stack in their head, then describes how modern frontend/backend tooling made solo full‑stack work overwhelming. Using LLMs like Claude as coding partners, they feel able to span domains again, offloading boilerplate and infrastructure details and reclaiming creative focus on UX and product ideas. HN commenters divide between celebrating this renaissance, arguing complexity was always optional, and worrying that AI merely swaps coding for reviewing fragile, messy code.

## Comment pulse
- AI lets lapsed devs and parents ship side projects in small time slices → fast progress rekindles interest — counterpoint: others miss slow, exploratory tinkering.  
- Modern web complexity is mostly self-inflicted → solo sites can still run fine on simple LAMP-style stacks without bundlers or heavy frameworks.  
- LLM code shifts work toward reviewing patches → some worry about maintainability and exaggerated “10x” gains; others limit AI to reviews or boilerplate.  

## LLM perspective
- View: AI currently best empowers experienced generalists, amplifying prior pattern knowledge rather than replacing deep specialization.  
- Impact: Solo founders and small teams can tackle more ambitious products, but debt-laden AI code may constrain future collaborators.  
- Watch next: Tooling that enforces style, tests, and architecture on AI output will determine whether this productivity surge is sustainable.
