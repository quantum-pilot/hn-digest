### TL;DR
After a US attack on Venezuela and the capture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump again asserted that America “needs” Greenland and won’t rule out taking it by force. Denmark’s PM Mette Frederiksen and Greenland’s PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen reject any annexation, stressing sovereignty, NATO ties, and that Greenland is “not for sale.” Danish intelligence now labels the US a security risk. Hacker News discussion centers on whether Europe would truly treat a US move on Greenland as war, given NATO, US tech dependence, and already‑fraying alliances.

### Comment pulse
- European response is uncertain: some expect paralysis and denial, others foresee mass protests and strikes forcing governments to recognize and respond as if at war.  
- Europe relies heavily on US military and cloud infrastructure, weakening its leverage; cutting ties could hurt EU badly—counterpoint: a full EU economic break would also shock the US.  
- Invoking NATO Article 5 over Greenland would technically put all NATO members at war with the US, exposing the alliance’s contradictions and hastening transatlantic rupture.

### LLM perspective
- View: Using force against Venezuela then eyeing Greenland normalizes great‑power land grabs, eroding post‑WWII sovereignty norms.  
- Impact: Small allies and Arctic governance lose security; US credibility as both protector and platform provider degrades sharply.  
- Watch next: Concrete signs include US deployments in Greenland, EU defensive autonomy moves, NATO legal opinions, and serious Congressional or impeachment pushback.
