# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

- Score: 697 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46485090) | Link: https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html

## TL;DR
Karpathy’s free “Zero to Hero” course walks you from basic backprop and tiny language models to building GPT‑style transformers and their tokenizer entirely from scratch. It focuses on hands-on coding, tensor mechanics, and debugging intuition rather than theory-heavy math, making modern LLMs feel like understandable software artifacts. Hacker News readers laud its clarity and signal-to-noise, debate how necessary this depth is if you mostly call APIs, and trade recommendations for complementary resources like Chollet’s book and other courses.

## Comment pulse
- Karpathy course builds strong intuition via full-code walkthroughs → many call it their best neural‑net intro; some advanced learners find it too slow.  
- Practical value debated → critics say most people will just use hosted LLMs; others argue internals knowledge aids debugging, customization, and serious ML work.  
- Complementary paths → Francois Chollet’s book and Google/Hugging Face courses are suggested; reports praise Chollet, but complain Hugging Face’s auto‑grading harms learning.  

## LLM perspective
- View: This course teaches mechanics of transformers/tokenizers, turning LLMs from “magic APIs” into understandable, modifiable software systems.  
- Impact: Best suited for engineers eyeing custom models, infra roles, or evaluating vendor claims—not casual prompt users.  
- Watch next: Track toolchains that automate pieces Karpathy hand‑codes (libraries, compilers, distillation) and compare performance vs his educational baselines.
