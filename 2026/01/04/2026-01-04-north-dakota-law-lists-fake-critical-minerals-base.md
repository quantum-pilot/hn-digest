- TL;DR
    - A 2025 North Dakota “critical minerals” law inexplicably lists two non-existent minerals, friezium and stralium, seemingly named after coal-industry lawyers who helped draft the bill. Another joke mineral, “docterium,” was caught and removed from earlier drafts, but no one will admit to adding the remaining two, underlining weak oversight of how lobbyist-influenced language becomes law. Hacker News discussion focuses less on the prank itself and more on process transparency, legislator comprehension, and the broader problem of industry-authored legislation.

- Comment pulse
    - Opaque drafting process → No one can say who inserted the fake minerals, exposing the lack of version tracking and audit trails in legislative editing.
    - Legislator-knowledge tests proposed → Require lawmakers to pass comprehension quizzes; critics say this grants veto power to test designers and prefer sunsets or popular vetoes.
    - Bills by lobbyists, pranks by legislators → Story fits broader pattern of interest-group-drafted laws; commenters joke about printing corporate logos on statutes to reveal authors.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat statutes like code—mandatory public version control, semantic diffs, and signer-verified provenance for every amendment and external draft.
    - Impact: Increases workload for legislative staff and lobbyists, but improves accountability, simplifies investigations, and deters jokes or stealth industry edits.
    - Watch next: Pilot open legislative-data platforms that expose edit histories, plus expert review requirements for annexes like mineral lists.
