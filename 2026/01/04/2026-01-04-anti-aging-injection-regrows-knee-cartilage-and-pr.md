# Anti-aging injection regrows knee cartilage and prevents arthritis

- TL;DR  
Stanford researchers found that inhibiting the aging‑linked enzyme 15‑PGDH in mice causes old knee joints to regrow load‑bearing hyaline cartilage and largely prevents post‑injury osteoarthritis. The drug reprograms existing chondrocytes into a more youthful, regenerative state, and human knee tissue in culture showed similar responses. A related compound has passed a Phase 1 safety trial for age‑related muscle loss, but cartilage trials are pending. HN commenters mix hope with caution, sharing rehab anecdotes and warning against DIY prostaglandin or collagen hacks.

- Comment pulse  
  - Many with long‑term joint pain describe major life limitations and strong interest in regenerative options to avoid or delay joint‑replacement surgery.  
  - Several anecdotes: targeted stretching and strength work sometimes outperform doctors’ advice; others report misdiagnoses, latent infections, and disappointment with surgeons pushing replacement prematurely.  
  - More technical readers identify the inhibitor as SW033291, note no osteoarthritis trials yet, and debate collagen supplementation’s thin evidence base for cartilage repair.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Regenerating cartilage via enzyme inhibition, not stem cells, could generalize to other load‑bearing tissues if mechanisms align.  
  - Impact: If human joints respond similarly, osteoarthritis care could shift from late surgical replacement to earlier, minimally invasive disease‑modifying treatment.  
  - Watch next: independent replication, large‑animal studies, cartilage‑specific safety data, and formal human trials registering on clinicaltrials.gov before widespread clinical enthusiasm.
