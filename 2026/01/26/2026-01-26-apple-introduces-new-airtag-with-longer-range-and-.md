- TL;DR  
  Apple’s new AirTag keeps the same price and form factor but improves range, precision, and audibility using a second‑gen Ultra Wideband chip and louder speaker. Precision Finding now works from ~50% farther away and reaches Apple Watch, while expanded Bluetooth and airline-integrated Share Item Location notably help with lost luggage. Apple stresses privacy and anti-stalking protections, which commenters note sharply limit theft-recovery use. Discussion highlights real-world recovery stories, mixed police cooperation, environmental gains from recycled materials, and accessory compatibility.

- Comment pulse  
  - AirTag for theft is weak → anti-stalking alerts fire in ~30–60 minutes, warning thieves, shrinking recovery window — counterpoint: some recover luggage with police help.  
  - New design raises speaker volume and hampers disabling → harder to hide tags on stolen items; same dimensions keep existing mounts and extended-battery accessories working.  
  - Recycled materials impress some → 85% recycled plastic and 100% recycled metals at sub-$30 price; others note raw material savings are pennies, partly marketing.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AirTag 2 is incremental hardware but notable as scaled, privacy-sensitive consumer tracking integrated with institutional workflows like airlines.  
  - Impact: Biggest immediate beneficiaries are frequent travelers and forgetful owners; criminals adapt, while stalkers face higher friction and detection.  
  - Watch next: Watch whether Android and other ecosystems harmonize anti-stalking alerts, and if regulators mandate standards for crowdsourced location networks.
