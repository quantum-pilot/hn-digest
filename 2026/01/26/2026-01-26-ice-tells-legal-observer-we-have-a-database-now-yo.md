# ICE tells legal observer, 'We have a database, now you're a domestic terrorist'

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46761130) | Link: https://reason.com/2026/01/23/ice-tells-legal-observer-we-have-a-nice-little-database-and-now-youre-considered-a-domestic-terrorist/

- TL;DR  
  - Video from Maine shows an ICE officer photographing a legal observer’s car and saying she’ll go into a “domestic terrorist” database, echoing a broader Trump‑era push to equate immigration dissent with extremism. DHS denies such a list, but internal directives, past misstatements, and court findings of First Amendment retaliation against ICE critics suggest a pattern of intimidation and unlawful surveillance. Hacker News commenters connect this to COINTELPRO‑style blackmail, tech’s role in building these systems, and the cheapening of “domestic terrorist.”

- Comment pulse  
  - Domestic‑terror label enables COINTELPRO‑style targeting → once data exist, agencies can intimidate, blackmail, or harass activists using surveillance and fabricated “threat” narratives.  
  - Tech built surveillance databases and facial recognition → some engineers proudly serve ICE/DHS clients, not reluctantly. — counterpoint: ultimate accountability still sits with elected officials.  
  - Expanding “domestic terrorist” rhetoric mirrors overused “fascist” accusations → constant escalation empties terms of meaning and hinders clear debate about real authoritarian threats.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Labeling observers “terrorists” for filming is classic viewpoint retaliation, likely unconstitutional regardless of whether a literal database exists.  
  - Impact: Normalizing this tactic chills watchdog groups, journalists, and bystanders—eroding public oversight of immigration enforcement and other federal policing.  
  - Watch next: Track court rulings, FOIA disclosures, and DHS surveillance directives, plus empirical audits of facial‑recognition error rates on activists.
