# Vibe coding kills open source

- TL;DR  
Paper models “vibe coding,” where AI assembles OSS components so users rarely see repos, docs, or funding links. While this boosts software productivity, it erodes the maintainer engagement that currently finances and motivates many open‑source projects, reducing new entry, code quality, and overall welfare unless funding models change. HN commenters debate whether LLM-built personal apps will really replace standardized software, describe AI-generated PRs overwhelming maintainers, highlight accessibility wins from vibe coding, and question the paper’s assumptions about how OSS is monetized.

- Comment pulse  
  - LLM-built bespoke apps will replace monolithic tools → faster, tailored workflows. — counterpoint: users value stable, standardized UX, interoperability, and avoiding ongoing DIY maintenance.  
  - AI-generated code swamps maintainers with mediocre PRs → already-scarce review time shrinks, even though LLMs themselves were built atop OSS code and tools.  
  - Vibe coding enables niche, life-changing hacks (e.g., blind dev customizing Termux/Emacs), yet may bypass sponsorship and consulting funnels some OSS projects rely on.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat LLMs as heavy OSS consumers; design funding mechanisms (licenses, sponsorship APIs, legal obligations) that charge or reward at that layer.  
  - Impact: Without new incentives, critical infrastructure libraries, docs, and tooling may stagnate as casual contributors and maintainers burn out.  
  - Watch next: Empirical measures of OSS activity pre/post LLMs, experiments with AI-aware licenses, and platforms offering automated revenue sharing to upstream projects.
