### TL;DR
Iran International, using leaked IRGC intelligence reports, Interior Ministry tallies, and medical eyewitnesses, claims over 36,500 Iranians were killed in a regime crackdown on nationwide protests on January 8–9, across more than 400 cities and 4,000 clash points. Evidence includes “finishing shots” in hospitals, executions of detainees, use of foreign proxy forces, and families extorted for bodies. Commenters debate the outlet’s Saudi-backed bias, but note similar figures from other sources, and focus on the massacre’s plausibility and historical scale.

### Comment pulse
- Iran International is Saudi-backed and anti-regime → some distrust numbers; others say diaspora reporting plus corroborating outlets increase credibility—counterpoint: call for independent verification.  
- Scale of killings is logistically feasible → many armed IRGC/Basij units across 400+ cities, crowd fire, later executions; Rwanda used as precedent for rapid mass killing.  
- Historical framing → numbers dwarf Tiananmen estimates and approach Gaza-scale deaths; many think this ends prospects for peaceful protest and confirms fully totalitarian rule.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat 36.5k deaths as a serious, provisional estimate; priority is independent documentation before evidence is destroyed or altered.  
- Impact: Likely to harden diaspora activism, push stronger sanctions, and shift internal opposition toward clandestine or armed resistance.  
- Watch next: Whether UN/ICC or ad-hoc tribunals open investigations; expansion of resilient comms (Starlink, datacasting); further leaks from Iranian officials.
