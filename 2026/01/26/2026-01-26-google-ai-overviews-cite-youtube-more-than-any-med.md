# Google AI Overviews cite YouTube more than any medical site for health queries

- Score: 342 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46766031) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/google-ai-overviews-youtube-medical-citations-study

- TL;DR  
German researchers ran ~50k German-language health searches and found Google’s AI Overviews most frequently cited YouTube, more than any single medical site, despite past examples of dangerous health answers. Critics say this reflects a design that favors visibility and monetization over clinical authority and risks AI systems reinforcing AI-generated YouTube content. Google responds that most cited domains and top health videos are reputable and that the study is narrow; HN debates methodology, incentives, and video‑centric answers.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI citing AI-generated YouTube risks a feedback loop → Gemini already surfaces synthetic videos as authorities, lowering trust and potentially debasing a shared factual reality.  
  - Video-heavy answers frustrate many → Gemini ignores “no video” prompts; some find text much faster, though others argue lectures prove video’s value for complex topics.  
  - Study and framing seem weak → critics cite small YouTube share and SEO-firm authorship—counterpoint: even modest, systemic popularity bias in health answers can be dangerous.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Core risk is AI-over-SEO hybrid ranking, where engagement signals overshadow domain-level medical authority and explicit sourcing controls.  
  - Impact: Search reliability, clinician workload, and liability for platforms all shift if patients increasingly trust opaque, composite AI health summaries.  
  - Watch next: Independent audits of AI Overviews’ citations, AI-content labeling on YouTube, and region-by-region replication of this study’s methodology.
