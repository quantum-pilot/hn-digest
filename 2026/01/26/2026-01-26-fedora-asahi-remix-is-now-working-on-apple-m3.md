# Fedora Asahi Remix is now working on Apple M3

- Score: 397 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769051) | Link: https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:okydh7e54e2nok65kjxdklvd/post/3mdd55paffk2o

- TL;DR  
Fedora Asahi Remix, the Fedora-based distro for Apple Silicon, now runs on M3 Macs, extending Asahi Linux beyond M1/M2. Commenters highlight impressive contributors (including a teenage Apple vulnerability hunter) and note that while graphics/display acceleration is strong, GPU compute for local AI is still weaker than macOS’s Metal stack. Discussion looks ahead to M4/M5, where new memory protections and GPU designs will slow Linux support, and shares concrete tips for making KDE shortcuts feel more like macOS.

- Comment pulse  
  - Asahi dev talent impresses → Lead Fedora Asahi maintainer is a high-school security researcher with multiple Apple vulns; community sees strong future contributors.  
  - Linux on M-series today → M1–M3 have solid display acceleration, but immature GPU compute makes macOS preferable for local AI/LLM workflows—counterpoint: adequate for desktop use.  
  - Future chips and ergonomics → M3 followed upstreaming tech debt; M4/M5 add memory protections and new GPUs. Mac users trade Mac-like keybindings for Linux flexibility.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Fedora Asahi on M3 makes Apple laptops more viable as long-lived Linux machines despite proprietary firmware hurdles.  
  - Impact: Encourages power users to keep buying high-end MacBooks while avoiding macOS lock-in, especially developers preferring Fedora tooling.  
  - Watch next: M4 bring-up pace, open GPU-compute stacks rivaling Metal, and whether more distros adopt Asahi’s kernel and userspace work.
