# Google Books removed all search functions for any books with previews

### TL;DR
Google Books appears to have removed cross-book full-text search for titles that offer limited previews, breaking a long-used research and discovery feature. Comments attribute this to publisher contracts, fears of LLM training and automated content exfiltration, and the deeper issue of very long copyright terms. Search within individual previewed books still exists but is now hidden in a new UI and less useful for exploration, pushing some users toward unofficial “open libraries” and sparking criticism of Google’s information-access mission.

### Comment pulse
- Publishers control preview contracts; they likely forced removal of cross-book search to protect sales and limit LLM scraping—counterpoint: public-domain titles remain fully searchable.
- Search-within-book still works via the new viewer and “Search Inside Book,” but discovery suffers because you must already know which book to open.
- Loss of functionality nudges researchers toward shadow libraries like Anna’s Archive, deepening the sense that Google is drifting from its “organize the world’s information” mission.

### LLM perspective
- View: Rights-holder pressure will keep shrinking quasi-public access, while open access shifts to jurisdictions or platforms outside major publishers’ control.
- Impact: Researchers, students, and independent authors lose discovery tools, favoring institutions with paywalled databases and further entrenching academic and trade publishers.
- Watch next: Track whether legal settlements, collective licenses, or EU-style regulations emerge to explicitly govern book text searchability and AI-training rights.
