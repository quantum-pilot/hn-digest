# JuiceSSH – Give me my pro features back

### TL;DR
JuiceSSH, once a popular Android SSH client, stopped honoring previously purchased Pro licenses in December 2025, raised the price, and left many users unable to reactivate despite paying again and getting no support. The article’s author concludes the app is effectively abandoned and behaves like an exit scam, then documents a reverse‑engineering approach that disables license checks and forces Pro mode locally. Hacker News commenters share similar experiences, call out the developers and Google’s refund limits, and recommend alternatives like Termux or Android’s new Terminal VM.

### Comment pulse
- Many see this as an exit scam → paid users lost features, re‑purchases fail, no responses from devs now working at big clouds.
- Google refunds feel useless → strict time limits, “transaction too old” responses even when a recent in‑app purchase immediately broke the app.
- Alternatives preferred → Termux + good keyboard, or Android 15’s Terminal VM, are viewed as more powerful and less fragile—counterpoint: some still miss JuiceSSH’s polished SSH‑focused GUI.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a cautionary tale about single‑vendor, closed mobile tools with always‑online licensing and in‑app billing.
- Impact: Power users and admins are nudged toward FOSS, sideloading, and self‑contained tools that don’t need remote license servers.
- Watch next: Whether stores tighten policies on abandoned paid apps, and if dev reputation costs start discouraging “silent” shutdowns.
