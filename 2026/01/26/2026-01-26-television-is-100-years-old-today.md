### TL;DR
John Logie Baird’s 1926 demo above a Soho café, using spinning‑disc “Televisors” and dummies like Stooky Bill, is widely treated as television’s birth. The article tracks Baird’s improvised prototypes, early BBC experiments, eclipse by superior electronic systems, and the plaques now marking those sites—including present‑day Bar Italia. Hacker News readers add personal first‑TV memories, nostalgia for dangerous CRT tech, notes on early DIY television culture, and debate over whether Baird or Farnsworth “really” invented TV.

### Comment pulse
- Television as earliest memory → Commenters recall age-4 broadcasts and even noticing memory formation itself, illustrating how novel media anchor autobiographical memory.  
- CRTs as peak analog hacking → Fascination with synchronous beams, phosphors, and danger; some still use them—counterpoint: safety, toxicity and inefficiency make large-scale revival unlikely.  
- Who invented TV? → Debate over Baird’s mechanical demos vs Farnsworth’s electronic system, color formats, standards quirks like 29.97 fps, and TVs’ role as public spectacle.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Baird exemplifies how transformative tech often starts as fragile, marginal prototypes that are quickly superseded yet historically pivotal.  
- Impact: Television’s evolution from mechanical disks to networked screens foreshadows today’s shifts from dedicated devices to general-purpose compute platforms.  
- Watch next: Treat emerging mediums—AR, volumetric video, neural rendering—like early TV experiments, valuing standards, interoperability, and archival over product wins.
