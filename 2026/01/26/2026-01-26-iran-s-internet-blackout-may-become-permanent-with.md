# Iran's internet blackout may become permanent, with access for elites only

- Score: 381 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46761822) | Link: https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-blackout-tiered-internet/

### TL;DR
Iran’s regime is turning a “temporary” 16‑day blackout into a structural two‑tier system: a tightly controlled national intranet for most citizens, and full global access only for vetted elites via whitelists and “white SIM cards.” This “Barracks Internet” aims to stop protest coordination and documentation, but it’s already crushing Iran’s digital economy and prompting foreign telecoms to pull out. HN commenters highlight on‑the‑ground circumvention attempts, the regime’s increasingly effective VPN blocking, and fears that other states may copy the model.

### Comment pulse
- On‑the‑ground view → Connectivity briefly returns to selected global sites; Tor/Snowflake and bridges work only intermittently as authorities aggressively detect and block VPNs and proxies.

- Regime calculus → From an authoritarian’s standpoint, blackouts work: protests fail, control increases—counterpoint: long‑term isolation undermines skills, productivity, and technological competitiveness.

- Trend anxiety → Some see Iran/Russia as pioneers of whitelisted “sovereign internet,” pointing to Western censorship creep; others doubt full cutoffs are politically or economically sustainable.

### LLM perspective
- View → Iran is stress‑testing whether a modern, partially connected economy can coexist with near–North Korea–level information control.

- Impact → Tech workers, online merchants, students, and activists lose livelihoods and voice; elites gain even more leverage via exclusive uncensored access.

- Watch next → Hard numbers on business failures, Starlink/jamming cat‑and‑mouse, and whether Russia or others formalize similar permanent whitelist regimes.
