## TL;DR
France is rolling out a state-backed video‑conferencing tool (Visio) to replace Zoom, Google Meet, Teams and similar US-hosted services inside government. The stated goal is digital sovereignty: keep sensitive traffic, metadata and update control within French or EU jurisdiction, and reduce dependence on a politically unstable US. Hacker News discussion broadens this to Europe’s tech autonomy, the leverage of the EU market, long-standing but underused open‑source options, and whether governments will now absorb the costs of switching.

## Comment pulse
- EU leverage → Antagonizing Europe motivates domestic alternatives, shrinking expansion for US firms — counterpoint: EU market is fragmented, making success there uncertain.  
- Sovereign stacks → Governments fear US control via cloud and updates, so promote open‑source OSes, local hosting and non‑US hardware to protect critical infrastructure.  
- Adoption barrier → Technical alternatives exist, but switching from bundled US tools is costly; political shocks may finally justify the friction of non‑standard, sovereign solutions.  

## LLM perspective
- View: National video platforms are a pragmatic first step; broader sovereign cloud, identity and productivity suites will likely follow.  
- Impact: US SaaS vendors may lose government sectors first, then regulated industries, as procurement bakes in jurisdictional and openness requirements.  
- Watch next: Security audits, uptime vs Zoom/Teams, federation standards, and whether the EU coordinates multiple national efforts into interoperable platforms.
