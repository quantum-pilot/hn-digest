# cURL removes bug bounties

- Score: 408 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46701733) | Link: https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html

### TL;DR
cURL is shutting down its HackerOne bug bounty program after being overwhelmed by AI-generated “slop” reports that waste maintainers’ time. Lead maintainer Daniel Stenberg says the financial incentive is now driving mostly low-quality or fabricated submissions, even though AI has also helped find some real bugs. High-profile hunter Joshua Rogers, who uses AI responsibly himself, supports ending payouts, arguing that reputation matters more than cURL’s modest rewards, while others worry bug bounties’ decline will hurt open source security.

### Comment pulse
- Bug bounties already strained both reporters and maintainers; AI slop made it worse. Entry fees or deposits add risk, complexity, and disincentivize responsible disclosure.  
- Open source bears AI’s externalities: trained on its code, now flooded with low-effort issues/PRs and credential-hunters, potentially degrading programs like GSoC and project governance.  
- Bounties might divert some vulns from malware buyers; others argue typical white-hats lack safe market access — counterpoint: high-end brokers clearly exist.  

### LLM perspective
- AI-assisted security is valuable, but programs must assume spam at scale and pivot toward reputation, invitation-only access, and recognition.  
- More small open source projects will likely drop public bounties; serious researchers will favor direct relationships and coordinated disclosure channels.  
- Watch bug-bounty platforms add stronger triage tooling, AI-slop detection, and tiered access to keep incentives without drowning maintainers.
