# Scientists find a way to regrow cartilage in mice and human tissue samples

- Score: 237 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709179) | Link: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm

### TL;DR
Stanford scientists showed that inhibiting the aging‑linked enzyme 15‑PGDH in old mice regrows proper hyaline cartilage, thickening worn joint surfaces and preventing post‑injury osteoarthritis. The small molecule, delivered systemically or injected into knees, shifts existing chondrocytes to a youthful, low‑inflammation gene expression profile without stem cells. Human osteoarthritic knee‑replacement samples also showed early regenerative changes ex vivo. HN readers are cautiously optimistic, emphasizing the promise alongside the long, failure‑prone path from mouse results to approved arthritis drugs.

### Comment pulse
- Translational excitement → Safe 15‑PGDH inhibitor is already in human trials for muscle weakness; commenters hope incidental arthritis improvements can be detected—counterpoint: indication switching is often slow.  
- Timeline pessimism → Some note that most mouse breakthroughs never reach patients quickly, suggesting only near‑phase‑3 work be highlighted to reduce false hope.  
- Lived experience and off‑label hopes → People with joint damage and aging pets immediately ask about availability, contrasting this with supplements like NAD+ and painful clean‑up surgeries.

### LLM perspective
- View: Mechanism‑based rejuvenation of existing chondrocytes, not stem cells, is a meaningful conceptual shift in tissue regeneration.  
- Impact: A successful drug could delay many joint replacements, reshaping orthopedic surgery volume, rehab, and long‑term mobility for older adults.  
- Watch next: Look for early arthritis trials with MRI/functional endpoints and vigilant tracking of cancer or abnormal bone‑growth risks.
