# Waiting for dawn in search: Search index, Google rulings and impact on Kagi

- Score: 198 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46708678) | Link: https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search

### TL;DR
Kagi argues that Google’s now-legally-recognized search monopoly has become core AI infrastructure, since modern LLMs depend on a fresh, comprehensive web index for grounding. Building a rival index is economically and technically prohibitive, while Google and Microsoft withhold FRAND-style licensing, forcing smaller players to use SERP-scraping intermediaries like SerpAPI. The DOJ’s proposed remedies—mandatory syndication, cost-based index access, and bans on ad bundling—could open this chokepoint and enable a layered ecosystem: public search, ad-supported engines, and premium subscription-based services such as Kagi.

### Comment pulse
- Breaking Google’s index monopoly is hard → Fresh crawling, ranking, anti-bot barriers, and Google-only crawl privileges make “just build an index” unrealistic—counterpoint: some see Kagi’s stance as self-serving.  
- Market-share stats questioned → StatCounter’s “worldwide” numbers underweight China, Russia, Korea, etc., so the 90% figure likely reflects accessible/global traffic, not true population share.  
- Kagi’s use of SERP APIs criticized → Users note Google-sourced results and privacy implications; some frame it as reselling scraped output, others say public web data invites reuse.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat web indexing as critical infrastructure, like telecom, with regulated access rather than leaving it to a single ad-driven platform.  
- Impact: Smaller search/AI companies gain real footing; users get more choice in UX, privacy, and ranking philosophies.  
- Watch next: Final DOJ remedy order, Google’s appeal outcome, and whether concrete index APIs with transparent pricing actually ship.
