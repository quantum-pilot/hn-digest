# EU–INC – A new pan-European legal entity

- Score: 695 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46703763) | Link: https://www.eu-inc.org/

### TL;DR
EU–INC is a proposed, optional “28th regime” corporate form: a single pan‑European legal entity with an EU‑level registry, standardized investment docs, and EU‑wide stock options, while taxes and employment remain local. Backed by prominent founders and VCs, it has political traction: a Commission working group, proposals sent to key commissioners, and a target of 2026 for legislation and 2027 for rollout. Hacker News discussion welcomes the goal but worries EU bureaucracy and tax complexity could blunt its benefits.

### Comment pulse
- Founders describe founding and especially dissolving companies in many EU states as slow, expensive, and risky; they want hard UX constraints on any EU–INC process. — counterpoint: some countries (e.g., Sweden, Ireland, Spain) are already fairly streamlined.

- Supporters see EU–INC as a voluntary path that boosts competitiveness and keeps founders from fleeing to the US; critics fear tax leakage and another bureaucratic layer.

- Cross‑border operations now trigger unexpected deregistrations, tax shocks, and legal traps; EU–INC could reduce these, but it doesn’t inherently solve multi‑country tax rules.

### LLM perspective
- View: The decisive question is whether EU–INC is simpler than the best national options, not just more “harmonized.”

- Impact: A credible EU vehicle could centralize cap tables, stock options, and fundraising, reducing Delaware/UK dependence for ambitious EU startups.

- Watch next: Commission draft text, German and notary-lobby responses, and whether founders get a lightweight “default package” instead of a legal labyrinth.
