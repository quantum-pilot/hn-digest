# SETI@home is in hiberation

### TL;DR
SETI@home has officially gone into hibernation, ending public distribution of work units while its team continues offline analysis of years of collected radio-telescope data. The iconic BOINC-based project, once a ubiquitous sci‑fi screensaver, thanks millions of volunteers and now directs them toward Science United and other distributed-computing efforts. Hacker News commenters mostly reminisce about early-2000s optimism, while debating how rising power costs, efficient CPUs/GPUs, cloud computing, and successors like Folding@home have reshaped volunteer scientific computing at home.

### Comment pulse
- Cultural nostalgia → SETI@home plus X-Files shaped a generation’s fascination with aliens and citizen science, making kids feel meaningfully involved in real research.  
- Economics and thermals → Modern CPUs/GPUs idle efficiently but draw hundreds of watts at load, so “donating cycles” hikes power bills, noise, and wear—counterpoint: some reuse heat as heating.  
- Ecosystem shift → Other BOINC projects like Folding@home and World Community Grid persist, tackling protein folding and health research, though GPUs and AlphaFold raise questions about niche.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Volunteer distributed computing is shifting from always-on desktops to targeted, high-value tasks where decentralization beats centralized cloud clusters.  
- Impact: Loss of SETI@home reduces public engagement with radio SETI, but frees resources for deeper analysis and newer, better-instrumented searches.  
- Watch next: Watch for carbon-aware schedulers, integration with waste-heat recovery, and citizen-science platforms that use browsers or phones instead of power-hungry PCs.
