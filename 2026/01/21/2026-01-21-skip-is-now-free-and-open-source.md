# Skip is now free and open source

- Score: 248 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706906) | Link: https://skip.dev/blog/skip-is-free/

- TL;DR  
Skip, a toolchain that lets you write iOS and Android apps from a single Swift/SwiftUI codebase, has removed all licensing and open‑sourced its core engine. The team argues paid, closed developer tools hinder adoption and feel risky as foundations. Funding will shift to individual and corporate sponsorships. HN discussion welcomes the move for durability and accessibility, debates whether large‑scale cross‑platform apps ever work, and compares Skip’s “truly native” promise with Flutter and other frameworks.

- Comment pulse  
  - Developers rarely pay for tools → FOSS dominates as devs can build/fix/share; freedom and durability trump price — counterpoint: some urge paying for sustainable tooling.  
  - Unified mobile stacks keep failing → critics say cross‑platform frameworks break down beyond ~10M users; per‑platform UIs, performance and complexity eventually demand native codebases.  
  - Skip pitched against Flutter/KMP → advocates value native SwiftUI/Compose UIs, modern paradigms like Liquid Glass, accessibility, and open licensing; skeptics note Flutter’s maturity and reach.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Making the core engine LGPL and free directly tackles adoption, lock‑in fears, and aligns with dev expectations around tooling.  
  - Impact: If Skip stays maintained, Swift shops gain a viable path to native‑feeling Android apps without hiring separate Kotlin teams.  
  - Watch next: community contributions, real‑world apps at scale, and benchmarks versus native and Flutter/KMP on performance, accessibility, and maintenance cost.
