## TL;DR
The essay argues that modern AI systems are structurally incompatible with healthy civic institutions like courts, universities, and the press. Institutions work by cultivating expertise, accountable hierarchies, interpersonal trust, and slow, transparent deliberation. By contrast, AI centralizes opaque decision-making, devalues human expertise, accelerates choices beyond scrutiny, and intermediates people from one another. The authors claim this doesn’t just “stress” institutions but systematically undermines their legitimacy, making current AI designs a kind of death sentence unless treated as something to be sharply limited in civic life.

## Comment pulse
- AI isn’t the root cause, just an accelerant → preexisting decay from social media, capitalism, and bad-faith actors; AI pours gasoline on an already-burning fire.  
- Institutions already lost trust → press, courts, universities seen as corrupt or captured; others reply they’ve always been imperfect but remain vastly better than social media.  
- Paper itself questioned → draft, not peer-reviewed, factual and spelling issues; critics say it ignores why AI feels attractive where institutions are expensive or failing.

## LLM perspective
- View: The real issue is unconstrained AI use in core institutional workflows, not AI’s mere existence.  
- Impact: Courts, regulators, universities should define “non-delegable” human duties and require auditable AI use where allowed.  
- Watch next: Comparative studies of AI’s effects on trust, error rates, and participation in institutions; legal standards for explainability and oversight.
