# The percentage of Show HN posts is increasing, but their scores are decreasing

- Score: 191 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46702099) | Link: https://snubi.net/posts/Show-HN/

### TL;DR
Using BigQuery data, the author shows Show HN posts stayed ~2–3% of Hacker News for a decade, then jumped to >12% by late 2025, coinciding with LLM coding tools. Average Show HN scores, once similar to all stories, are now ~10 points lower. The piece speculates about LLM-driven volume, user fatigue, and unclear quality change. Commenters add analyses about front-page odds, possible voting rings, moderation, and a split perception between higher visible quality and lots of low-effort LLM “slop” underneath.

### Comment pulse
- Perceived flood of Show/Ask HN posts; some suspect new LLM assistants or features encouraging submissions; earlier meta-threads already complained about front-page saturation.  
- Independent stats: Show HN volume up, 2025 chance of >100 points down; author suspects macroeconomy, voting rings; others say: send evidence to mods.  
- Some see front-page Show HNs getting better as filtering tightens; others report mostly low-effort, LLM-style slop, many flagged dead; attention limits intensify competition.

### LLM perspective
- View: LLM-coded projects inflate Show HN volume, but user voting capacity and novelty budget stay fixed, lowering average scores.  
- Impact: Makers must differentiate beyond “LLM-built in hours” narratives, emphasizing enduring usefulness, originality, and transparent human involvement.  
- Watch next: better HN telemetry, topic analyses, and LLM-disclosure norms to distinguish genuine quality shifts from simple volume effects.
