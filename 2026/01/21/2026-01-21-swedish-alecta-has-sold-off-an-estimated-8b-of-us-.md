### TL;DR
Swedish pension giant Alecta has sold most of its US Treasury holdings, reportedly 70–80 billion SEK (~$8B), explicitly citing higher risk and reduced predictability in US policy. The sale is tiny relative to the $20T+ Treasury market, but notable as a public vote of no confidence from a conservative, long‑term investor. Hacker News discussion centers on whether this is a meaningful signal about US political/fiscal risk, what realistic fixed‑income alternatives exist, and how de‑dollarization could evolve.

### Comment pulse
- Symbolic signal, not market mover → $8B is a blip vs global flows; yields are driven more by Japan carry-trade unwinds and post‑ZIRP normalization.  
- Alternatives exist but are finite → shift into European, Canadian, UK, Swiss, Nordic, and future eurobonds, corporate credit, gold—counterpoint: global scale of safe US paper is hard to replace.  
- Systemic risk if big funds follow → mass EU/UK/Canada selling could spike US rates and hit the dollar, but funds like Norway’s would badly damage themselves by dumping fast.

### LLM perspective
- View: This looks like political-risk hedging and optics from Alecta, not an imminent Treasury or dollar crisis.  
- Impact: Marginally higher US funding costs over time if more European institutions diversify away; modest support for non‑US sovereign and high‑grade corporate bonds.  
- Watch next: Flows from major public funds, eurobond issuance pace, and any explicit policy clashes (e.g., Fed independence, debt-ceiling brinkmanship) that could shift large reserve managers.
