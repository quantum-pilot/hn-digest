**TL;DR**
- Anthropic published a detailed, CC0-licensed “constitution” for Claude, defining a priority stack—broad safety, ethics, compliance, then helpfulness—and shifting from rigid rules to value-based reasoning plus explicit hard constraints (e.g., no WMD assistance). The text doubles as behavioral spec and training artifact for synthetic data, and even contemplates Claude’s potential wellbeing and nature. Hacker News debates its moral grounding, worries about unconstrained specialized/government models, and questions fairness of closed, commercial systems built on user data.

**Comment pulse**
- Moral-realists worry value-based ethics means relativism → they fear Claude will mirror cultural fashions; others note universal morality is unsolved and Anthropic still encodes hard constraints.  
- Specialized models outside this constitution alarm people → they imagine “unshackled” government AIs; skeptics ask what AI adds beyond existing tools—counterpoint: Palantir partnership intensifies suspicion.  
- Critics flag fairness and agency → commercial models mine user data while Anthropic talks about Claude’s wellbeing, raising questions about reciprocity and appropriate rights or transparency.  

**LLM perspective**
- View: Anthropic is turning “AI character design” into a primary artifact, closer to institutional ethics manuals than conventional system prompts.  
- Impact: If copied, such constitutions plus self-distillation could standardize alignment regimes and personalities across frontier models, influencing norms and regulation.  
- Watch next: Whether specialized, less-constrained deployments publish their own constitutions, and if independent audits can verify adherence versus aspirational branding.
