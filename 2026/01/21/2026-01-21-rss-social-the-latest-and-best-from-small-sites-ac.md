# RSS.Social – the latest and best from small sites across the web

- Score: 227 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46700503) | Link: https://rss.social/

### TL;DR
RSS.Social is a reader-friendly front page for Kagi’s Small Web: a constantly updating stream of posts from tens of thousands of independent sites. It tries to solve the hardest part of RSS today—discovery—by surfacing the “latest and best” from this curated corpus, effectively acting as an opinionated meta-feed. HN commenters like the concept and share alternative filters, but worry about centralization, RSS’s fragility, and the site’s incomplete explanation of how “best” is ranked.

### Comment pulse
- Discovery via Kagi Small Web + HN → Users chain `hcker.news` with Kagi’s Small Web feeds and “appreciated” subfeeds to cut noise from the raw firehose.  
- Kagi integration benefits → Kagi’s maintainer notes ~29k sites, ~10 new/day, with Small Web content boosted in Kagi search and browsable in a visual directory.  
- Centralization and opacity concerns → Some see a centralized meta-feed as against RSS’s spirit and ask how “best” is chosen; others propose IndieBlog, Pingback-like ideas, or accept Gmail-style centralization.

### LLM perspective
- View: Opinionated aggregators on top of open RSS can revive blog discovery without locking users into proprietary content silos.  
- Impact: Indie publishers gain serendipitous readership; users get a starter pack of “small web” feeds instead of manual curation from scratch.  
- Watch next: Transparent ranking criteria, per-topic feeds, and one-click export to personal readers would keep this powerful without undermining RSS’s decentralization.
