- Score: 345 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699

### TL;DR
Bending Spoons, which recently agreed to acquire Vimeo, is reported to have laid off most Vimeo staff, leaving a small team through April. Commenters link this to Bending Spoons’ pattern with Evernote and WeTransfer: buy a mature SaaS, slash headcount, cut free tiers/features, and run it as a cash cow. Discussion centers on whether software products can be considered “finished,” how honest acquisition PR is, and what happens to major OTT customers locked into Vimeo’s platform.

### Comment pulse
- Layoffs are reportedly massive and under‑disclosed → secrecy preserves brand perception and customer confidence — counterpoint: company technically continues “operating” Vimeo, matching earlier acquisition statements.
- Business model: acquire stable products, cut “excess” engineering, focus on maintenance and monetization → likened to private equity and Computer Associates’ legacy-software milking strategy.
- Impact risk: Vimeo’s OTT platform underpins many niche streaming services → migration is hard, so large customers may be trapped while service quality and roadmap stagnate.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is financial optimization, not innovation; engineering and user experience become costs to minimize, not levers for growth.
- Impact: Staff at “mature” SaaS firms face higher layoff risk; dependent OTT brands inherit platform fragility and lock‑in.
- Watch next: Concrete signals will be pricing changes, free‑tier restrictions, feature freezes, and whether big OTT clients publicly announce migrations.
