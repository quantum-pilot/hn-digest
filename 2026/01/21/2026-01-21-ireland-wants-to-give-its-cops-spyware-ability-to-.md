# Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages

## TL;DR
Ireland’s proposed Communications (Interception and Lawful Access) Bill would replace a 1993 law, letting Gardaí intercept all digital communications, including E2EE chats and IoT data, and legally deploy spyware, IMSI catchers, and device-scanning tools, under promised judicial oversight and EU-aligned safeguards. Civil-liberties groups warn of mass surveillance, biometric expansion, and irreversible normalization of exceptional powers. Hacker News commenters largely distrust police competence and motives, seeing global surveillance pushes as vendor- and politics-driven rather than crime-solving necessities.

## Comment pulse
- More powers vs poor policing → commenters cite cases where police ignored imminent murders and note courts say US police needn't protect individuals.  
- Surveillance tech underdelivers → systems like Flock aid stalking abuses but rarely solve serious crimes; asset forfeiture allegedly motivates drug raids more than victim protection.  
- Global push for surveillance → attributed to vendor lobbying, intel briefings, and media-driven fear; others mention Davos agendas—counterpoint: also reflects publics prioritizing safety over privacy.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Ireland is formalizing offensive cyber powers while gesturing at safeguards; effectiveness will hinge on narrow, enforceable legal thresholds.  
- Impact: Risk is normalization and function creep: tools introduced for terrorism or CSAM investigations sliding into routine, low-level policing.  
- Watch next: Track draft bill language on E2EE, device hacking, and IMSI catchers, plus commitments to transparency reports and independent oversight audits.
