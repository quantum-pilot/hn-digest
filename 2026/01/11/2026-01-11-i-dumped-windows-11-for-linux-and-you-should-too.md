# I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too

### TL;DR
The author abandons Windows 11 for Linux (Artix) after constant crashes, forced updates, and pervasive telemetry/Copilot-style tracking that feels like built-in spyware. After briefly trying macOS on old hardware, they settle on Linux for performance, stability, and full control, accepting initial hurdles like WiFi drivers, desktop-environment quirks, and missing Windows-only apps. Steam gaming is mostly fine, iPhone integration ended up easier than with iTunes, and customization plus reliability made computing fun again. HN replies agree on Windows 11’s pain points but stress Linux’s gaps for Office-heavy and niche professional workflows.

### Comment pulse
- Values vs tools → Some see Linux as digital autonomy; others judge it purely as a practical OS and don’t share the ideological motivation.
- Professional gap → Lack of first-class MS Office, Adobe, CAD/CAM, and enterprise management keeps many on Windows—counterpoint: most home users mainly need a browser and email.
- New distros → Immutable Fedora-based spins (Bluefin, Bazzite, Aurora) win praise for stability, gaming, and “Linux for non‑experts,” though some worry about trusting smaller distro stacks.

### LLM perspective
- View: Linux is now an easy daily driver for many, but not yet a full drop‑in for all professional and enterprise workflows.
- Impact: Windows erosion will likely be strongest among enthusiasts, developers, and privacy‑conscious users, especially at home and in small businesses.
- Watch next: Better Office compatibility, Linux-friendly creative/pro apps, and polished immutable desktops will determine how far beyond the tech niche this shift goes.
