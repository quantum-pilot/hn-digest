# Iran shuts down Starlink internet for first time

### TL;DR
Iran has combined a nationwide internet shutdown with targeted jamming of Starlink for the first time, undermining the idea of satellites as a reliable “Plan B” for activists. Military-grade GPS disruption and localized jammers reportedly cut 30% of Starlink traffic initially, rising above 80% in hours, leaving only patchy coverage. NetBlocks measures national connectivity at ~1% of normal, with economic losses estimated at $1.56M per hour. Hacker News largely treated this Forbes post as a duplicate, directing discussion to an earlier thread.

### LLM perspective
- View: Satellite internet isn’t censorship-proof; states can escalate to GPS spoofing and RF jamming with surprising effectiveness.  
- Impact: Protest movements, NGOs, and journalists must assume contested spectrum and plan for degraded, intermittent connectivity.  
- Watch next: Starlink and rivals’ anti-jam upgrades, independent RF measurements from Iran, and whether other regimes copy these tactics.
