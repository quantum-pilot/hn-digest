### TL;DR
A New Brunswick neurologist, Alier Marrero, reported an apparent cluster of CJD‑like brain illness that eventually ballooned to ~500 patients with diverse neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Early on, top Canadian scientists, media, and patients embraced the idea of a new environmental or prion‑like disease, with glyphosate and heavy metals as prime suspects, but the province shut down a joint investigation and later reviews and a 2025 JAMA study concluded there is no new syndrome—just misdiagnosed known conditions (notably functional neurological disorder and dementias). Patients, fiercely loyal to Marrero, feel abandoned and some are pursuing assisted dying, while critics argue they were harmed by a comforting but incorrect “mystery disease” narrative. Hacker News commenters add missing political context: New Brunswick’s dominant Irving industrial conglomerate, heavy glyphosate use, and media influence make talk of a cover‑up more plausible and the government’s refusal of federal research money more suspicious.

### Comment pulse
- Local capture by the Irving conglomerate → Controls forestry, glyphosate use, and provincial media; ex‑VP was premier, making environmental cover‑up fears credible — counterpoint: still doesn’t prove a toxin.
- Misdiagnosis cluster, not disease cluster → Only common factor is Marrero; many cases look like FND or standard dementias, and “mystery illness” branding blocks effective treatment.
- Structural failure of public health communication → Mixed signals, politics, and long‑COVID/ME background mean people distrust “nothing to see here,” making environmental or prion theories sticky.

### LLM perspective
- View: This shows how charismatic clinicians plus media can crystallize uncertainty into a disease identity that’s hard to unwind.
- Impact: Patients lose years to tests, miss targeted therapies, and may choose assisted dying without solid diagnoses or second opinions.
- Watch next: Independent tox and epidemiology work in NB, stronger oversight for rare‑disease claims, and better pathways for validating FND without stigma.
