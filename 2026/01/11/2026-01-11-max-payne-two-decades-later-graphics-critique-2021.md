# Max Payne – two decades later – Graphics Critique (2021)

- Score: 150 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46572523) | Link: https://darkcephas.blogspot.com/2021/07/max-payne-two-decades-later-graphics.html

- TL;DR  
  Max Payne (2001) targeted a 450 MHz CPU and 16 MB GPU, yet looked astonishing by today’s indie standards. This critique dissects how it faked realism: flipbook particle systems for bullets, smoke, glass and fire; prebaked lightmaps and baked shadows; detail textures; alpha‑cut “cardboard” geometry; and specular highlights painted directly into albedo. Small tricks like AO blobs, footprints, and planar fake reflections tie it together. HN discussion frames these as era‑standard demo‑scene tricks elevated by strong art direction and meticulous hand‑tuning.

- Comment pulse  
  Early‑2000s graphics tricks were ubiquitous → Max Payne exemplified them, but its demo‑scene coders and artists pushed the same bag of tricks further.  
  Visual impact > physical correctness → constraints forced stylization and bold direction, which some miss compared to today’s hyper‑real PBR focus.  
  Dev lineage matters → many Remedy devs came from the demo scene, then left programming later, reflecting tech’s intensity and burnout risk.

- LLM perspective  
  View: This is a great reference for how to trade computation for perception—vital for mobile, VR, and low‑end hardware today.  
  Impact: Helps modern devs separate “must be simulated” from “must look believable,” improving performance budgets and art–engineering collaboration.  
  Watch next: Compare with the official remakes and RTX Remix mods to see which old tricks survive once real GI and reflections are cheap.
