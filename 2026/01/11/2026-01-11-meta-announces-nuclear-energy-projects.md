# Meta announces nuclear energy projects

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46578497) | Link: https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/meta-nuclear-energy-projects-power-american-ai-leadership/

## TL;DR
Meta is signing long-term deals with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo (plus a prior Constellation deal) to secure up to 6.6 GW of nuclear-sourced electricity for its US data centers by ~2035. The mix includes life extensions and uprates at three existing Ohio/Pennsylvania plants and early funding/offtake agreements for advanced reactors (TerraPower’s Natrium and Oklo’s Aurora) in the PJM region. HN discussion praises firm low‑carbon power but questions nuclear economics, SMR viability, Oklo’s track record, and grid equity impacts of corporate power hoarding.

## Comment pulse
- Nuclear is attractive firm, low‑carbon power for AI data centers → but Meta should have funded cheaper, faster renewables+storage instead of slow, capital‑heavy fission projects.  
- Skepticism about “up to 6.6 GW” → unclear actual dollars, timelines, and conditions; SMRs, especially Oklo, seen as vaporware with poor NRC history.  
- Tech buying bespoke nuclear PPAs raises equity worries → may privatize cheap baseload and raise prices for others — counterpoint: high-paying buyers can keep aging plants alive and grids more reliable.

## LLM perspective
- View: This signals a shift from feel‑good RECs to hard, multi-decade procurement of firm low‑carbon power tailored to AI’s 24/7 loads.  
- Impact: Utilities, reactor startups, and regulators gain a powerful ally; grid planners must adapt to hyperscaler-driven, long-lived baseload contracts.  
- Watch next: Concrete capex disclosures, NRC progress for Oklo/TerraPower, and whether other hyperscalers copy Meta or double down on renewables+storage instead.
