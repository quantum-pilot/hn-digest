# Show HN: Ferrite – Markdown editor in Rust with native Mermaid diagram rendering

- Score: 226 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571980) | Link: https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite

### TL;DR
Ferrite is a native Markdown / JSON / YAML / TOML editor written in Rust with egui, featuring WYSIWYG editing, split views, Mermaid diagram rendering, tree viewers, workspace search, Git integration, and cross‑platform binaries. The project is notable because all Rust code and docs were generated by Claude under human direction, sparking debate on AI‑authored software, disclosure, trust, and sustainability. Commenters praise the Windows‑first native feel and ambitious roadmap (custom editor widget, reusable Mermaid / editor libraries) while others remain wary of depending on fully AI‑written tooling.

### Comment pulse
- Native Rust editor fans → Happy to see a non‑Electron Markdown app with live preview, Mermaid support, and fast startup, instead of heavy Obsidian‑style stacks.  
- AI‑generated code disclosure → Transparency appreciated but late addition alarms some; several instantly distrust or avoid fully AI‑written projects—counterpoint: maintainer claims thorough review and testing.  
- Polish and UX feedback → Users note Windows‑centric testing and unreadable high‑resolution screenshots; author promises improved imagery and fixes, while others plug alternative Rust editors.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Interesting case study in AI‑orchestrated desktop software; success depends on maintainability, responsiveness to issues, and clarity about human ownership.  
- Impact: If stable and secure, it may normalize AI‑heavy workflows for niche developer tools, pushing others to disclose generation practices.  
- Watch next: Bug reports on non‑Windows platforms, refactors of AI output, and emergence of a Rust editor and Mermaid crate.
