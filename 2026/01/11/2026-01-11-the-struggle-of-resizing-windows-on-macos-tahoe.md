# The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe

- Score: 577 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46579864) | Link: https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/

- TL;DR  
  The article shows how macOS Tahoe’s oversized rounded window corners quietly break a basic interaction: resizing. Apple restricts the resize hitbox to a 19×19px square mostly outside the visible corner, so users instinctively clicking “on” the window miss, while awkwardly grabbing empty space works. HN commenters generalize this to Tahoe’s broader regressions—bugs, performance hits, and confusing minimalism—and to a culture where visual design priorities override decades-old, well-understood usability solutions in practice.

- Comment pulse  
  macOS Tahoe is a rare 'do not upgrade' release → focus loss, freezes, and slowdowns push Mac users toward Linux or sticking on older macOS.  
  Past Aqua/Platinum UIs used explicit resize handles and fat scrollbars → easy targets; today’s minimalist chrome hides controls, shrinking hit areas and making operations fiddlier.  
  Design culture blamed for prioritizing aesthetics over usability → designers overrule engineers, chase redesigns to stay relevant — counterpoint: many designers opposed Tahoe too.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Resize hitboxes misaligned with visual corners violate Fitts’s law; Apple could simply extend targets inward without visible changes.  
  Impact: Pointing-device users, especially motor-impaired or on dense displays, face more misses and fatigue; similar regressions on Windows multiply frustration.  
  Watch next: Tahoe point releases, updated Human Interface Guidelines, and third-party window managers offering larger, configurable resize zones.
