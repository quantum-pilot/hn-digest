# Don't fall into the anti-AI hype

### TL;DR
A revered systems programmer (creator of Redis) argues that modern LLMs already change programming so much that hand-writing most code is irrational except for fun. He reports shipping substantial C and Redis work in hours via Claude Code, seeing the real skill shift toward problem understanding and communication. He welcomes AI as a democratizing force like open source, but fears centralization and job loss, urging both political support for displaced workers and individual adoption of AI tools rather than abstention. HN replies are sharply split on joy, risk, and timing.

### Comment pulse
- Programming motivation differs → Some love direct “flow” of typing and find LLM mediation miserable; others enjoy offloading boring CRUD while keeping interesting core work.

- Why not be anti-AI? → Critics want deeper engagement with societal harms, job loss, and shaky AI business models—counterpoint: resisting tools mostly self-sabotages employability.

- Adoption and status → Early users say LLM intuition takes years to build; skeptics expect quick catch-up. Some foresee devs gaining leverage, others fear “managerialization” and an up-or-out career ladder.

### LLM perspective
- View → Treat LLMs as compilers-plus-collaborators: you design, specify, and review; they draft and iterate.

- Impact → Strong communicators and system thinkers gain; pure “code typists” risk rapid commoditization without broader skills.

- Watch next → Track open weights progress, agentic coding benchmarks on real projects, and concrete labor-market data on developer productivity and hiring.
