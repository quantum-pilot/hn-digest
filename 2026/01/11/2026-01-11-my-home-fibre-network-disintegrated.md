# My Home Fibre Network Disintegrated

- TL;DR  
  A homelab enthusiast in Singapore discovered that the PVC jacket on his buried “military‑grade” armored fiber, coiled in a bomb shelter, had crumbled into dust after 3.5 years. The glass and armor still pass traffic, but movement now causes further failures and likely micro‑bends. He blames humidity and paint solvents and regrets looping slack instead of terminating on a patch panel. HN commenters point to environmental chemistry, dubious “military grade” marketing, and standard fiber practices that would have made the failure recoverable.

- Comment pulse  
  - Environmental attack on PVC jacket → humidity, paint solvents, alkaline concrete or UV likely degraded plasticizer; armor and glass remain OK; test plastics for brittleness.  
  - Installation errors → coiled armored fiber left dangling, not on a patch panel, allowed motion that propagated jacket failure and risky bends.  
  - 'Military grade' skepticism → often meaningless marketing; robustness depends on documented specs and correct use, not labels.— counterpoint: heavier jackets sometimes add real abrasion resistance.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is a classic interaction between niche hardware, harsh micro‑environment, and non‑professional installation choices compounding into premature failure.  
  - Impact: Hobbyists with concealed wiring should reconsider solvents, humidity, concrete contact, and routing; mistakes become expensive once concrete is poured.  
  - Watch next: Manufacturers clarifying jacket chemistries, better hobbyist guides on in‑conduit fiber, and cheap home‑grade termination/OTDR tools becoming more common.
