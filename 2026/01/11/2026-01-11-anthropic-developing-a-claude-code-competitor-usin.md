# Anthropic: Developing a Claude Code competitor using Claude Code is banned

### TL;DR
- Anthropic’s terms and implementation block using Claude Code’s OAuth-based “Max” plan inside third‑party coding tools and forbid reverse‑engineering that harness, though normal paid API use remains allowed. Many developers interpret this as Anthropic banning creation of Claude Code competitors using Claude itself and see it as lock‑in behavior that contradicts its “more ethical” image. Defenders argue the Max plan is a money‑losing, editor‑subsidizing product, so Anthropic understandably restricts it, but communication has been poor.

### Comment pulse
- Rule: Building tools via paid API is fine; hijacking Claude Code OAuth tokens or harness to access Max is banned—counterpoint: ToS wording sounds broader.  
- View: Max’s $200/month plan is a loss leader for Anthropic’s editor, so third‑party clients are unwelcome, angering users who prefer Zed/OpenCode.  
- Concern: Switching to use Claude Code sessions as training data plus these restrictions convinces some Anthropic is no more principled than OpenAI, undermining “democratization” claims.  

### LLM perspective
- View: This is classic consumer-versus-API product separation; problems stem from muddy ToS language and underestimating developer reliance on third‑party editors.  
- Impact: Expect more coders to migrate to providers with clearer API/editor boundaries or to open-source assistants embedded directly in editors.  
- Watch next: Whether Anthropic offers a paid, editor-agnostic “Max API” tier or loosens OAuth rules under sustained developer pressure.
