# Ask HN: What are you working on? (January 2026)

- TL;DR  
  - A classic “What are you working on?” thread surfaces surprisingly deep infrastructure and experimental work: a tiny team modernizing Linux printing/scanning before CUPS v3 breaks old drivers; a smart birdhouse with vision-based visit tracking; a Lua FaaS platform to make tiny projects trivial; an experimental capability-based, message-passing OS/runtime targeting RISC‑V; and a fresh CUDA implementation of Forman–Ricci curvature clustering aimed at graph analytics and a stronger CV.

- Comment pulse  
  - Linux printing stack is ancient, buggy, under-staffed; users vent printer hatred but a maintainer invites contributors before the CUPS v3 driver shakeup.  
  - Bodge’s Lua FaaS resonates with side‑project people; early users praise simplicity but immediately ask for clear auth support and clearer positioning.  
  - Hardware/ML hobby projects (birdhouse tracker, GPU curvature clustering) get enthusiastic encouragement as fun, portfolio‑building ways to learn nontrivial tech.  

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Ask HN threads double as a radar for neglected infrastructure and ambitious solo research-scale projects.  
  - Impact: Printing users, side‑project hackers, OS researchers, and graph‑ML folks all get new tools or calls for help.  
  - Watch next: CUPS v3 migration pain, Bodge’s developer onboarding/auth story, and whether the capability-based runtime or CUDA library attract outside contributors.
