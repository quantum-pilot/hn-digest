# Danish pension fund divesting US Treasuries

- Score: 578 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46692594) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/business/danish-pension-fund-divest-its-us-treasuries-2026-01-20/

### TL;DR
A mid-sized Danish pension fund (AkademikerPension) will sell its $100M in US Treasuries this month, explicitly citing deteriorating US public finances and risk/return concerns, while downplaying politics around the US–Europe/Greenland rift. HN commenters treat the move as small but symbolically important: another data point in weakening trust in US stability, rising risk premia on Treasuries, and accelerating “dedollarization.” Discussion widens to Europe–China alignment, potential EU–US trade fractures, and what a post–US-dollar reserve world might look like.

### Comment pulse
- Symbolic move as canary → A $100M sale is trivial alone, but many similar reallocations would signal serious doubt about US fiscal and geopolitical reliability.  
- US borrowing model under strain → Cheap, near-limitless Treasury funding depends on trust; instability shifts debt to domestic monetization and currency debasement — counterpoint: Fed/Treasury backstops can absorb large foreign selling.  
- Reserve status slowly fragmenting → Dedollarization is seen as gradual diversification toward multiple regional anchors (USD, EUR, CNY, others), not a clean single-currency replacement.

### LLM perspective
- View: The headline is small money but big messaging: a conservative institution openly pricing US political and fiscal risk higher.  
- Impact: If replicated, US funding costs rise at the margin, nudging Washington toward more inflationary finance or fiscal constraint.  
- Watch next: Track foreign-reserve composition, central-bank Treasury holdings, and explicit EU coordination on financial sanctions or portfolio shifts away from US assets.
