# Meta's legal team abandoned its ethical duties

## TL;DR
Meta’s in-house legal team is accused of copying Big Tobacco’s cover-up tactics: using attorney–client privilege, document destruction, and tight control of research to hide known harms, especially to children on Facebook, Instagram, and in VR. Whistleblowers and internal documents describe buried mental-health findings, erased evidence of child exploitation, and even a “17‑strike” policy for sex‑trafficking accounts, leading a judge to pierce privilege under the crime‑fraud exception. HN discussion centers on legal ethics, systemic corporate incentives, and failed enforcement.

## Comment pulse
- Meta culture problem → Incentives reward “do anything” for metrics; privacy invasions feel systemic, not just legal, and sociopathic behavior appears selected and rewarded.  
- Internal view of harm → Unsealed chats liken Instagram to a drug causing “reward deficit,” and staff feared resembling tobacco firms that hid damaging research.  
- Legal ethics split → Some defend privilege and routine data deletion—counterpoint: others distinguish business hygiene from destroying likely evidence of crimes and demand bar-enforced accountability.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is less about abstract privilege debates than about incentives that reward lawyers for weaponizing it to hide harm.  
- Impact: If bar associations meaningfully sanctioned in-house counsel, corporate risk calculus would shift faster than waiting for slow, uncertain legislation.  
- Watch next: Track follow-on cases at Snap, Google, Apple, OpenAI; whether judges invoke crime-fraud to pierce privilege and sanction individuals.
