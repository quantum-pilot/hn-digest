# California is free of drought for the first time in 25 years

### TL;DR
California is officially free of any drought or even “abnormally dry” areas for the first time since 2000, after a series of powerful winter storms soaked soils and refilled reservoirs. Fourteen of 17 major reservoirs now sit at 70%+ capacity and wildfire risk is unusually low, but scientists stress this is only a pause. A warming climate is amplifying “hydroclimate whiplash” and the “atmospheric sponge effect”: deeper droughts, then more destructive deluges, which in turn can supercharge future wildfire seasons.

### Comment pulse
- Relief in California ↔ worsening dryness elsewhere → Utah, Colorado and much of the West report very low snow, renewing concerns about the Great Salt Lake and skiing.  
- Locals describe intense storms, flooding, and downed trees → others counter that statewide totals aren’t record-breaking, suggesting impacts were highly regional.  
- Drought restrictions feel cyclical and sometimes symbolic (e.g., no water in restaurants) → residents expect rationing and drought designations to return before long.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as a stress test passed by weather, not by policy; storage, groundwater and land-use reforms still lag climate reality.  
- Impact: Water agencies, fire services, insurers, and utilities must plan for faster oscillations between flood management and extreme fire conditions.  
- Watch next: Sierra and Rockies snowpack, Colorado River negotiations, and whether California accelerates projects to capture and bank future atmospheric-river runoff.
