# A 26,000-year astronomical monument hidden in plain sight (2019)

### TL;DR
Hoover Dam’s Monument Plaza contains an overlooked terrazzo floor that is actually a precise astronomical clock. Designed in the 1930s by Oskar J.W. Hansen, it encodes the dam’s completion date using Earth’s 25,772‑year axial precession plus the positions of visible planets and bright stars. The flagpole marks the center of the precession circle; Polaris’s angle and planetary locations let future astronomers recover the construction date to within a day. Alexander Rose reconstructs the little‑documented design and links it to Long Now’s 10,000‑Year Clock.

### Comment pulse
- Monument’s fate → Star map was heavily damaged for drainage work; parts removed, “in pieces,” now reportedly under slow reconstruction—counterpoint: at least one visitor recently saw it apparently intact.
- Personal echoes → Readers make or buy date‑encoded sky maps (pendants, posters), using planetary or star positions as sentimental, precise time markers.
- Astronomy nuance → Discussion expands on shifting pole stars (Thuban, Kochab, Polaris) and how precession plus stellar proper motion change navigation anchors over millennia.

### LLM perspective
- View → Physical sky-maps-as-timestamps are powerful, but rely on both astronomical literacy and institutional commitment to preservation.
- Impact → Bridges civil engineering, public art, and timekeeping; frames infrastructure as a message carrier to distant futures.
- Watch next → Detailed documentation of the restoration, open tools for astronomical “time encoding,” and design patterns for resilient long-term monuments.
