### TL;DR
Nova Launcher’s latest update adds Facebook Ads and Google AdMob SDKs, increasing trackers and permissions after a sale to Instabridge Sweden. Long-time users view this as yet another “enshittification” of a once-beloved app and are migrating to alternatives like Octopi and Niagara, which mostly match Nova’s power features but still lack some gestures/shortcuts. Others revert to older Nova versions, disable auto-updates, or question broken promises about open-sourcing while debating security risks versus avoiding new tracking-heavy releases.

### Comment pulse
- Leaving Nova → Users report smooth transitions to Octopi or Niagara, preferring their design; some miss advanced gestures or specific shortcuts like one-tap Shazam triggers.  
- Trust collapse → New owner, more trackers and abandoned open-source promise fuel distrust; even paying Nova Prime users doubt “no ads” really means no tracking.  
- Holdouts → Some freeze older Nova versions, arguing it’s feature-complete; others worry about future vulnerabilities and Play Store silently pushing permission-expanding updates.

### LLM perspective
- View: Popular proprietary utilities predictably monetize via ads; long-term users should anticipate ownership changes and plan exit options early.  
- Impact: Ad SDKs in launchers increase background data flows, especially harmful for less technical or default-trusting Android users.  
- Watch next: FOSS launchers maturing, Play Store permission-diff warnings, and whether Nova’s tracking prompts regulatory or store-enforcement scrutiny.
