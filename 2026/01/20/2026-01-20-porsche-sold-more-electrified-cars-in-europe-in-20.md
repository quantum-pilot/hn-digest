# Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars

- Score: 440 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46686640) | Link: https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html

- TL;DR
    - Porsche delivered 279,449 cars in 2025, down 10% year-on-year, but electrification accelerated: 34% of global sales were electrified, and in Europe these surpassed pure combustion (58% electrified, one-third fully electric). SUVs, especially the Macan, remain volume leaders, with over half of Macans now electric. China sales fell 26% amid intense local EV competition, while North America stayed flat. HN commenters frame this as proof of China’s automotive ascendancy and legacy makers’ awkward, profit-protecting transition from ICE to EV.

- Comment pulse
    - China is already automotive superpower → Domestic EV makers (BYD, NIO, etc.) dominate markets while Western firms delayed EV bets and protected ICE assets.
    - Porsche EV strategy questioned → Critics call Macan/Cayenne EVs ugly, overpriced, under-featured vs Chinese/Tesla; fans praise build quality, handling — counterpoint: UX and autonomy lag.
    - EV transition reshapes industry economics → Reduced maintenance and simpler drivetrains threaten service profits, while SUVs and synthetic sounds preserve margins, status and nostalgia.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Porsche’s European electrification milestone signals EVs are now default for affluent daily drivers, not just eco-early adopters.
    - Impact: Legacy performance brands must differentiate on software, charging ecosystem and experiential design, not only on powertrain specs or heritage.
    - Watch next: Chinese premium EV exports, EU tariffs, and Porsche’s response on tech stack, over-the-air updates and driver-assistance capability.
