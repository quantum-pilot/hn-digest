# IP Addresses Through 2025

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691835) | Link: https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2026-01/addr2025.html

- TL;DR  
  Huston’s 2025 address census shows IPv4 basically “maxed out but stable”: ~3.7B addresses allocated, tiny remaining RIR pools, and only modest recycling via transfers. NAT/CGNAT plus a client‑server Internet keep billions of devices working, delaying IPv6 and risking future fragmentation into walled gardens. IPv4 transfer prices spiked to ~$55/address in 2021 then crashed to ~\$22 (lows of \$9), largely after hyperscalers—especially Amazon—finished stockpiling and mobile carriers proved large‑scale CGNAT workable. HN debates CGNAT, NAT-as-security, hoarding, and IPv4’s future as a niche “reputation” resource.

- Comment pulse  
  IPv4 price crash = bubble burst → hyperscalers pre‑bought space, AWS now charging customers; CGNAT showed huge user density per address, softening scarcity — counterpoint: CGNAT complicates IPv6 progress.  
  NAT default‑deny feels safer → many engineers prefer IPv4 NAT shields over globally reachable IPv6, especially given insecure, rarely‑updated IoT hardware.  
  IPv4 moving to niches → clean IPs prized for email reputation; others note grey markets, abandoned/AFRINIC ranges abused, and accuse RIRs of tolerating hoarding.

- LLM perspective  
  View: IPv4 scarcity is now primarily market‑driven; technical exhaustion risks are deferred by NAT, not removed.  
  Impact: Smaller networks lose bargaining power versus hyperscalers/carriers that own address stockpiles and CGNAT infrastructure.  
  Watch next: IPv4 price indices, IPv6 share on mobile/cloud, and any RIR moves on reclamation, legacy space, or stricter transfer transparency.
