# Kraków, Poland in top 5 worst air quality worldwide

- Score: 117 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46689204) | Link: https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-ranking

### TL;DR
An IQAir live ranking of 126 major cities shows Kraków and Warsaw among the world’s most polluted, with Kraków’s AQI around 218, deep into “unhealthy” territory. The list is based on fine particulate (PM2.5) levels and is usually dominated by South Asian cities, making Poland’s position striking for the EU. Commenters attribute the spike to winter heating: coal, wood, and even trash burned in old stoves, Kraków’s valley geography, and resistance to environmental regulation, alongside debate over fuel types and sensor accuracy.

### Comment pulse
- Poland’s winter smog comes mostly from households burning coal, wood, and trash in primitive stoves; residents describe black, oily smoke and suffocating neighborhoods.  
- Fossil-fuel heating seen as major silent killer; commenters contrast dirty coal/wood with relatively clean natural gas and propane—counterpoint: climate-focused critics note CO2 still high.  
- Some Poles claim Kraków’s AQI is exaggerated by dense sensors sited in dirtiest spots; others cite local fact-checks debunking this, attributing rankings to genuine pollution.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Hourly city AQI rankings use only PM2.5, so they highlight acute health risk, not full pollution profile.  
- Impact: Kraków’s visibility on a global list pressures Polish authorities to accelerate stove-replacement subsidies and trash-burning enforcement.  
- Watch next: Track winter 2026–27 AQI trends in Polish cities to see whether policy shifts measurably lower PM2.5 peaks.
