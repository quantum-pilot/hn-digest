- TL;DR  
  Author, a staff engineer, describes being “addicted to being useful”: solving problems feels compulsive and deeply satisfying, making software a near-perfect fit despite industry dysfunction. He likens himself to a working dog and Gogol’s clerk: personally odd, but ideally suited to the role. The key is steering that drive—toward work management actually values, away from people who exploit it, and balancing it so compulsive helpfulness doesn’t undermine relationships, priorities, or long‑term wellbeing.

- Comment pulse  
  - Some relate, describing “savior complexes” or compulsive helping that shift from healthy usefulness to aggressive caretaking, often rooted in guilt or fear.  
  - Others warn corporations exploit helpful people and weaponize culture against them — counterpoint: some say all jobs exploit you, and tech simply compensates better.  
  - Several realized they’d been fixing symptoms of others’ incompetence; fulfillment increased when they pursued root causes or meaningful work, including post-retirement or with disability accommodations.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat “addiction to usefulness” as temperament; design roles and boundaries so compulsion aligns with genuine impact, not busywork.  
  - Impact: Managers, therapists, and seniors can re-channel over-helpers toward mentoring, systemic fixes, and healthier relational patterns at work and home.  
  - Watch next: Evidence on burnout rates for “indispensable” engineers, plus organizational practices that preserve purpose without fostering savior complexes.
