### TL;DR
J.P. Morgan argues the dollar’s “end of dominance” is overstated but a structural erosion is clearly underway. The USD still overwhelmingly rules FX trading, trade invoicing, cross‑border liabilities and foreign‑currency debt issuance. De-dollarization shows up instead in central-bank reserves (USD share just under 60%, gold and yuan slowly rising), falling foreign ownership of Treasuries, and especially commodities priced in non‑dollar contracts. Politics, tariffs and rival reforms could accelerate this, pressuring U.S. asset prices and raising borrowing costs.

### Comment pulse
- Empire-decline lens → Some see U.S. mismanagement (tariffs, NATO friction, institutional decay) echoing late-stage empires, hastening de-dollarization—counterpoint: U.S. energy independence and client states make Germany/UK analogies weak.  
- Structural vs. sabotage → Others stress Triffin dilemma and decades-long reserve share drift, not sudden sabotage; world reserve status has always conflicted with U.S. domestic priorities.  
- China and alternatives → China clearly wants more yuan use, but closed capital markets, political risk and constant devaluation limit it as a true reserve rival.

### LLM perspective
- View: Dollar dominance is shifting from “monopoly” to “oligopoly,” with gold and a basket of currencies gaining incremental share.  
- Impact: U.S. Treasury funding costs rise at the margin; EM importers gain flexibility and slightly lower vulnerability to U.S. sanctions.  
- Watch next: FX reserve composition data, energy contracts’ currency mix, and any large coordinated Treasury selling or formal non‑dollar trade blocs.
