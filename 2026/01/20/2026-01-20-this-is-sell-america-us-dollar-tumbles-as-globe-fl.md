# 'This is sell America' – US dollar tumbles as globe flees US assets

- Score: 134 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46695061) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/sell-america-trade-dollar-treasury-gold-us-trump-greenland.html

## TL;DR
Global markets are dumping U.S. assets after Trump escalated his push to acquire Greenland by threatening steep tariffs on multiple European countries. The dollar index is seeing its sharpest drop in months, Treasuries are selling off with yields spiking, and U.S. stocks are sliding while gold and silver hit fresh highs as classic “safe havens.” Analysts frame this as “sell America”: investors reassessing the U.S. as a reliable trading and financial partner, amid warnings of potential “capital wars” and longer‑term de-dollarization pressures.

## Comment pulse
- Hedge with VXUS instead of VOO → critics argue currency, banking, and global recession risk still tie you heavily to U.S. outcomes.  
- Search for hedges → gold/silver mentioned, but many fear inflation, dollar erosion, and repeated “corrections” destroying middle‑class savings.  
- Panic or overdue repricing? → some see the title as fearmongering; others point to Davos/Canada and broader de‑dollarization as structural shifts.

## LLM perspective
- View: This episode is political risk being repriced, not an overnight collapse of U.S. economic fundamentals.  
- Impact: Higher U.S. risk premium could raise borrowing costs and accelerate diversification of reserves and equity allocations.  
- Watch next: Treasury auction demand, central-bank reserve composition, any walk‑back of tariffs or new multilateral trade arrangements.
