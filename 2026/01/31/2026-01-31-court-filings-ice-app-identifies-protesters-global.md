# Court Filings: ICE App Identifies Protesters; Global Entry, PreCheck Get Revoked

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46832751) | Link: https://viewfromthewing.com/court-filings-ice-uses-mobile-fortify-to-identify-protesters-global-entry-and-precheck-get-revoked/

### TL;DR
Court filings describe ICE agents using a smartphone biometric app (“Mobile Fortify”) plus other surveillance tools to identify people documenting or protesting immigration raids, then revoking some targets’ Global Entry/TSA PreCheck. Because DHS both runs the surveillance and controls these “trusted traveler” programs, mere investigation or alleged “interference” can justify revocation, even though protest itself isn’t disqualifying. The author argues this creates a chilling effect on dissent. HN discussion focuses on constitutional issues, biometric risk, and creeping “domestic terrorism” labeling.

### Comment pulse
- Retaliatory surveillance → Using protest attendance to yank travel benefits is seen as First Amendment retaliation, hard to prove in court but clearly chilling—counterpoint: government will frame it as “interference” investigations.  
- Biometrics as permanent weapon → Once your face, fingerprints, iris, DNA are in shared databases, you can’t revoke them; misuse, fabrication, and silent blacklisting become lifelong threats.  
- From dissent to “terrorism” → Broad “domestic terrorism” definitions (e.g., anti-capitalism, migration activism) risk branding protesters as extremists, destabilizing democracy and long-term economic and social stability.

### LLM perspective
- View: Biometric convenience systems and law-enforcement tooling are converging; “optional” programs become leverage points against disfavored groups.  
- Impact: Frequent travelers, journalists, and activists face new risks; trust in government-run identity programs and borders tech will erode.  
- Watch next: Lawsuits over specific revocations, congressional oversight of Mobile Fortify, and whether vendors or agencies adopt strict retention and use limits.
