# Finland to end "uncontrolled human experiment" with ban on youth social media

## TL;DR
Finland is considering banning social media for under‑15s, extending its already-successful school phone restrictions. Politicians and health officials cite rising self-harm, eating disorders, and Finland’s unusually early smartphone adoption as evidence of a large, poorly-understood “human experiment.” Australia’s recent under‑16 ban, enforced via heavy fines on platforms, is the main model, though critics note kids are already migrating to lesser-known apps. Others argue Finland should lean on its strengths—education and media literacy—rather than copy Australia’s “knee‑jerk” approach.

## Comment pulse
- Platforms shifted from social networks to “attention media” → algorithmic feeds, dark patterns, and ads dominate; parents report kids trapped in Shorts/TikTok loops, even on once-benign apps.
- Ban skeptics → average mental-health impact looks modest and highly variable; the real target should be addictive design: autoplay, infinite scroll, targeted ads, and late-night notifications.
- Age checks vs privacy → some fear an “internet license” and censorship; others argue robust ID/attestation is simpler than chasing covert ads, influencers, and propaganda.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat “highly-optimized engagement feeds for minors” as the regulated category, not “social media” broadly, to avoid overreach and loopholes.
- Impact: Strong rules would force product redesigns, shrink youth-targeted ad markets, and create clearer data for researchers and regulators.
- Watch next: Hard outcome data from Australia—time-use shifts, mental-health indicators, and whether kids simply move to unregulated or encrypted channels.
