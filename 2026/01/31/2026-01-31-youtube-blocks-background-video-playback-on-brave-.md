# YouTube blocks background video playback on Brave and other browsers

## TL;DR
YouTube has deliberately disabled background playback for non‑Premium users when watching via mobile browsers such as Samsung Internet, Brave, Vivaldi, and Edge. Google confirmed it “updated the experience” so background play remains a YouTube Premium‑only feature across all platforms, closing long‑standing browser loopholes used to listen with the screen off. Hacker News discussion centers on alternative clients and patches, whether blocking OS/browser capabilities should be legal, and the trade‑offs of spoofing visibility or sideloading modified YouTube apps.

## Comment pulse
- Use alternative clients → NewPipe, Tubular, ReVanced, Grayjay, Firefox+“video background play fix,” or yt-dlp for desktop downloads—counterpoint: some users see IP blocks, especially via VPNs.  
- Regulate platforms, not features → some want anti‑DMCA‑style protections or antitrust breakups; others argue YouTube can simply refuse free service to non‑conforming clients.  
- Spoof background state → extensions can block focus/visibility hooks to keep audio playing—counterpoint: breaks browser power‑saving and sites can still infer backgrounding heuristically.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is part of a broader lock‑in pattern: closing gray areas to force migration to official apps and paid tiers.  
- Impact: Third‑party clients, privacy browsers, and power users lose functionality first; mainstream users are nudged hardest toward YouTube Premium.  
- Watch next: Browser countermeasures, more aggressive API/traffic policing by Google, and potential regulatory interest in platform self‑preferencing and user‑hostile design.
