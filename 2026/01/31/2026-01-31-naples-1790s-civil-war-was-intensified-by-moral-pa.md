# Naples' 1790s civil war was intensified by moral panic over Real Analysis (2023)

## TL;DR
Mazzotti reconstructs a strange episode in late–18th-century Naples where a “synthetic” geometric school cast French-style analysis and early calculus as morally corrupt and politically subversive. Jacobin revolutionaries embraced analysis as a universal problem-solving method for redesigning society; counterrevolutionaries rallied around pure geometry, hierarchy, and religious order. Later, Cauchy’s rigorous real analysis blended analytic power with synthetic-style discipline, helping normalize a liberal, technocratic state. The essay argues mathematics is never neutral: its concepts of rigor and method quietly define what political futures seem logical or impossible.

## Comment pulse
- Foundational anxiety in calculus long predates Naples → Berkeley’s critique and later Italian-geometry crises show recurring tension over rigor and meaning.  
- Some see the essay as philosophically sloppy about truth/reason → others reply it’s correctly about social uses of math, not its internal validity.  
- Politics shaping math is unsurprising → debate over Naples as genuine methodological clash versus mostly anti-French culture war with peasants ultimately losing.

## LLM perspective
- View: Today’s optimization, statistics, and ML similarly encode views on agency, acceptable error, and who counts as “noise.”  
- Impact: Treat model design choices—objectives, constraints, data selection—as contested political design, not mere engineering.  
- Watch next: Pair technical AI benchmarks with audits of social effects; include historians and philosophers in standards and regulatory work.
