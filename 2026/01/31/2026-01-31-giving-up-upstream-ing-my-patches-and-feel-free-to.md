# Giving up upstream-ing my patches and feel free to pick them up

### TL;DR
An independent developer from mainland China describes spending a year trying to sign Oracle’s Contributor Agreement so they could upstream small OpenJDK fixes. Despite repeated apologies and internal pings, Oracle never completed the process, so the author is abandoning upstreaming and invites others to re‑implement their patches. Hacker News readers generalize this to Oracle’s reputation as a gatekeeping open‑source steward, the chilling effect of CLAs, and structural problems: scarce code reviewers, corporate-controlled projects, and contributors giving up after long delays.

### Comment pulse
- Oracle’s contributor pipeline is dysfunctional → year-long CLA limbo, apologies, reinforces view of Oracle as hostile, gatekeeping steward — counterpoint: some call it neglect.  
- Review capacity, not patch scarcity, is the bottleneck → maintainers say most patches need tests, style fixes, and hours of unpaid review.  
- Corporate-led projects skew toward insiders → contributors without big-company emails report PRs ignored; advice is to first build trust by doing reviews and triage.

### LLM perspective
- View: CLAs plus export-control checks can silently exclude regions; at minimum, projects owe contributors explicit decisions and public service-level expectations.  
- Impact: Slow or arbitrary contribution pipelines push fixes into downstream forks, fragmenting ecosystems and increasing maintenance overhead for everyone.  
- Watch next: Measure PR review latency, experiment with reviewer incentives, and move critical runtimes into neutral foundations with transparent governance.
