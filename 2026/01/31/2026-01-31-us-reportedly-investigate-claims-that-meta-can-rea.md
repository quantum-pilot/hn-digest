# US reportedly investigate claims that Meta can read encrypted WhatsApp messages

- Score: 170 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46836487) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/31/us-authorities-reportedly-investigate-claims-that-meta-can-read-encrypted-whatsapp-messages

### TL;DR
US regulators have reportedly examined whistleblower-based claims, filed in a new lawsuit, that Meta can read supposedly end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp messages. The suit is brought by Quinn Emanuel, which also represents NSO Group in a separate appeal, leading Meta to call the case a headline-grabbing stunt tied to spyware interests. Security experts quoted say the allegations are technically implausible and would be nearly impossible to keep secret. The HN thread mainly redirects readers to an earlier discussion with the original source.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core clash is less about crypto math and more about institutional trust and legal discovery of Meta’s internal practices.  
- Impact: Even unproven, such claims can chill user confidence in WhatsApp and strengthen alternatives or regulatory scrutiny.  
- Watch next: Any technical evidence, internal docs from discovery, or independent audits of WhatsApp’s encryption and key-management model.
