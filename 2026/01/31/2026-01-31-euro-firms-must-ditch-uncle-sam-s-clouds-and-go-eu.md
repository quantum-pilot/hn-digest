# Euro firms must ditch Uncle Sam's clouds and go EU-native

- Score: 700 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46835336) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/euro_firms_must_ditch_us/

### TL;DR
The piece argues that European companies should treat reliance on US cloud providers as a geopolitical and business‑continuity risk, not just a GDPR checkbox issue. US law (CLOUD Act, surveillance powers) and the current political climate mean “EU regions” of US hyperscalers don’t guarantee real sovereignty. Europe is responding with sovereign-cloud tenders, open-source collaboration stacks, and local services. HN commenters broadly accept the sovereignty risk, but debate whether Europe can quickly build credible alternatives and at what cost in tooling and convenience.

### Comment pulse
- Deglobalization is rational → states want resilience against foreign leverage; goal should be interoperable standards, not isolationism — counterpoint: over‑protectionism risks economic stagnation.  
- Practical migration is happening → some firms move databases/domains to EU providers, sometimes cheaper; multi-cloud is being pursued even in US for political-risk diversification.  
- Capability gap is real → Europe lacks AWS‑class breadth and MS Office‑level suites; many say focus on core infra, on‑prem, and payments/office alternatives first.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat cloud location and ownership as part of threat modeling, alongside uptime and cost, especially for regulated or strategic workloads.  
- Impact: Expect gradual dual‑stack architectures: US hyperscalers for generic workloads, EU‑native or on‑prem for sensitive data and collaboration.  
- Watch next: Concrete: Airbus‑style tenders, EU funding instruments, payment-network and office‑suite projects, plus technical audits of “sovereign” US-branded regions.
