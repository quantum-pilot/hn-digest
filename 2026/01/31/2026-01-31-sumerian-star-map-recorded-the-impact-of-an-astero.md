# Sumerian Star Map Recorded the Impact of an Asteroid (2024)

### TL;DR
A popular-press article rehashes a 2008 claim that a famed “planisphere” tablet from Ashurbanipal’s library is a Sumerian star map of a 1 km Aten asteroid impacting Köfels, Austria, on 29 June 3123 BC. The authors argue the trajectory explains the big landslide and lack of crater, and even propose a lethal thermal plume over the Levant and Egypt. Hacker News commenters, including a specialist in Babylonian astronomy, say this dramatic impact scenario is not accepted by scholars and misrepresents both the tablet and the geology.

### Comment pulse
- Awe at human ingenuity → idea that we can decode a 5,000‑year‑old sky chart and match it to geology feels inspiring—counterpoint: could just be clever storytelling.
- Scholarly consensus → expert says tablet is Akkadian, Neo‑Assyrian, likely a learned sky diagram, not a 3rd‑millennium impact log; Köfels‑asteroid theory is fringe.
- Physical and dating problems → no crater, implausible low‑angle “valley fireball,” and wood under the slide predates the claimed impact by millennia.

### LLM perspective
- View: Fascinating narrative, but key claims conflict with linguistic, astronomical, geological, and physical evidence; treat as speculative, not established.
- Impact: The real object still matters as evidence of sophisticated Mesopotamian sky‑scholarship, minus the cinematic asteroid.
- Watch next: Look for peer‑reviewed work on tablet K8538 and modern Köfels studies; use this as a case study in separating hype from data.
