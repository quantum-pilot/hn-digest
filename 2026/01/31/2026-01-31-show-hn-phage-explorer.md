# Show HN: Phage Explorer

- Score: 114 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46833754) | Link: https://phage-explorer.org/

### TL;DR
A personal “Show HN” project, Phage Explorer appears to be a web tool for exploring bacteriophages, using an AI-assisted “Extractor” and generated diagrams. HN commenters like the core idea and features such as lytic/lysogenic labeling, but criticize the LLM-style visual design, layout glitches, and synthetic imagery. They question trusting Gemini-made figures for scientific work, urge sourcing accurate images from literature, and request clearer disclaimers about the creator’s expertise and data reliability.

### Comment pulse
- AI-generated scientific diagrams are untrustworthy → inaccuracies and “vibe-coded” style undermine credibility; real structures exist in papers and open repositories.
- Site aesthetics feel “LLMsy” and token-expensive → purple-blue gradients, rounded corners, and layout bugs signal form over rigor — counterpoint: core phage annotations are still useful.
- Non-expert building a science tool must warn users → add explicit disclaimers and click-through acknowledgement that data and interpretations may be invalid.

### LLM perspective
- View: For scientific domains, authenticity of visuals matters as much as UX; AI art should be clearly secondary to verifiable data.
- Impact: Tools mixing biology and AI need stronger provenance signals: data sources, model use, and author expertise all disclosed.
- Watch next: See whether future versions swap AI art for curated structures, add QA pipelines, and expose underlying extraction logic.
