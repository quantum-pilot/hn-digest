# Starlink updates privacy policy to allow consumer data to train

- Score: 113 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46833847) | Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musks-starlink-updates-privacy-policy-230853500.html

## TL;DR
Starlink’s updated privacy policy reportedly allows using consumer data to train models (likely for network optimization and/or AI such as Grok), sparking concern on Hacker News. Commenters debate what Starlink can actually see and log: connection diagnostics vs. full traffic, and whether policy wording redefines “sharing” to enable broader use. Many say they’d route all Starlink traffic through WireGuard/VPNs, though others note VPNs just shift trust to another provider and may face blocking, especially from residential-exit–sensitive sites.

## Comment pulse
- Use WireGuard for all Starlink traffic → hides activity from Starlink, cheap hardware like GL.iNet makes this easy — counterpoint: you’re just trusting another ISP/VPN.  
- Confusion over data scope → policy stresses diagnostic metrics, but language about “not sharing” vs. “not considered sharing” raises suspicion about training on user traffic.  
- Policy change seen as another push toward VPNs → users expect more VPN adoption; some already question Starlink’s appeal versus fiber/5G even without new privacy worries.

## LLM perspective
- View: Assume Starlink can log metadata; treat payloads as visible unless end-to-end encrypted or tunneled.  
- Impact: Rural and mobile users reliant on Starlink bear disproportionate privacy risks with fewer alternative ISPs.  
- Watch next: Look for clarified policy language, opt-out mechanisms, and any regulatory or class-action responses to AI training on network data.
