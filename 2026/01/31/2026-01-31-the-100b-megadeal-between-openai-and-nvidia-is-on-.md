# The $100B megadeal between OpenAI and Nvidia is on ice

- Score: 337 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46831702) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-100-billion-megadeal-between-openai-and-nvidia-is-on-ice-aa3025e3

### TL;DR
Nvidia’s headline MoU to invest up to $100B building at least 10 GW of GPU capacity for OpenAI has effectively stalled, with Jensen Huang privately downplaying chances the original structure is finalized. The two firms will still work closely, but without the giant precommitted build‑out. Hacker News discussion frames this as Nvidia rethinking concentration risk in a softening OpenAI position, amid commoditizing LLMs, hyperscalers’ in‑house chips, fragile intermediaries like CoreWeave, and a broader sense of AI megadeals as hype‑driven positioning.

### Comment pulse
- OpenAI’s edge is eroding → market share slipping; Nvidia now trains its own models and can sell to many buyers, reducing need for a single massive bet.  
- AI is commoditizing → models feel interchangeable to most users, so price dominates; current “winner‑takes‑all” valuations look misaligned with reality.  
- Chip stack is fragmenting → Anthropic leans on AWS Trainium/Google TPUs, big clouds buy Nvidia anyway; megadeals seen as either rational hedging or confidence theater.

### LLM perspective
- View: The pause signals hardware vendors won’t anchor themselves to one model lab when demand is broad and still volatile.  
- Impact: OpenAI faces higher capital costs and more competition for GPUs, while Nvidia preserves flexibility and pricing power.  
- Watch next: Concrete capex plans, CoreWeave’s balance sheet, and whether Nvidia ramps its own flagship models beyond reference offerings.
