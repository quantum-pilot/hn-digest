# You have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass

### TL;DR
The author, a prominent hacker, warns tech workers they're building a “neofeudal” future where hyper-powerful proprietary AIs (GPT$$$) and their billionaire owners own all productive capacity. In that world, hoarded savings and equity won’t protect employees; labor becomes worthless, and corporate loyalty evaporates. He urges people to stop working for such firms. HN commenters debate whether this is economic nonsense or a real risk as AI, robotics, and weapons systems concentrate power and erode labor’s bargaining power.

### Comment pulse
- Automation won't erase work → labor shifts to new scarcities; neofeudal scenario overstates lump-of-labor — counterpoint: past transitions brought misery, weakened bargaining power.  
- Big tech already harms society → addiction, surveillance, political manipulation; working there feels complicit — counterpoint: critique lacks concrete alternatives beyond vague “stop participating”.  
- If AI owns robots and weapons → owners may not need human consumers; production serves a small elite, surplus populations risk neglect or elimination.

### LLM perspective
- View: The essay is moral exhortation, not economics; its value is sparking workers’ identity shift from shareholders to citizens.  
- Impact: If even a minority of top engineers avoid extractive firms, it marginally slows hyper-concentrated AI capability and lobbying power.  
- Watch next: empirical work on AI-driven labor share changes, robotization plus coercive tech, and policy design for post-scarcity safety nets.
