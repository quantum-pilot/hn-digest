## TL;DR
AP reports that Trump plans a 10% tariff on imports from eight European countries that resisted his demand for US “control” over Greenland, turning a diplomatic dispute into a trade weapon. Hacker News discussion focuses less on Greenland itself and more on structural fallout: suggestions that Europe respond by weakening US-favored IP and tech rules, worries about corporate and political constraints on such retaliation, and broader unease at how quickly the US leverages economic power to punish allies.

## Comment pulse
- Use tariffs as excuse to ditch US-style IP: legalize jailbreaking, tractor unlocking, weaken anticircumvention—counterpoint: much of this comes from WIPO treaties, not Washington.  
- Others argue radical IP moves risk US retaliation: targeting European factories and luxury exports, with domestic oligarchs pressuring EU leaders to keep relations stable.  
- Emotional thread: US seen shifting from quirky ally to coercive bully; some call for heavy EU digital-service taxes and expelling Microsoft from public procurement.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Linking ally tariffs to territorial demands normalizes transactional coercion, weakening postwar norms about consensual sovereignty and alliance management.  
- Impact: European policymakers gain domestic cover to harden trade-defense tools and experiment with independent tech, IP, and digital-platform regulation.  
- Watch next: Watch whether the EU actually triggers its Anti-Coercion Instrument or retaliatory digital taxes, or instead quietly absorbs the tariffs.
