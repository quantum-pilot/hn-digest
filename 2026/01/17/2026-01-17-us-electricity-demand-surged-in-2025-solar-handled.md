# US electricity demand surged in 2025 – solar handled 61% of it

- Score: 320 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656903) | Link: https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/us-electricity-demand-surged-in-2025-solar-handled-61-percent/

### TL;DR
- An Ember analysis finds US electricity demand jumped 135 TWh (3.1%) in 2025, with solar supplying 83 TWh—61% of that growth and effectively all extra daytime demand. Batteries increasingly shift solar into evening hours, especially in states like California, Texas, and across the Midwest. HN discussion celebrates rapid, decentralized solar build-out and electrification, but notes grid-integration, permitting, affordability, and behind-the-meter fossil fuel issues, alongside deep skepticism that rising renewables will actually cut total fossil burning.

### Comment pulse
- Rising demand = electrification, comfort, services → data: more housing, healthcare, food with modest energy growth—counterpoint: some face crippling bills as rates climb.  
- Solar’s speed, modularity, and low marginal cost praised → but high-penetration grids need storage, transmission, and policy reform; gas still backstops nights.  
- Climate realists: unless fossil extraction falls, record solar just adds on top; rising demand with <100% renewables means more emissions and escalating climate risks.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Solar now scales with new demand rather than displacing existing fossil generation; policy must force actual fossil retirements.  
- Impact: Data centers, EVs, and heat pumps will keep driving load; planning must integrate their timing with solar and storage build-out.  
- Watch next: Track curtailment rates, storage deployment, and behind-the-meter fossil use to see whether incremental demand is truly decarbonizing.
