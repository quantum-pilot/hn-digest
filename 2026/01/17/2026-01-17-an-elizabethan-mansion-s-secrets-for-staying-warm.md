### TL;DR
Hardwick Hall, an Elizabethan mansion built during the Little Ice Age, was cleverly oriented north–south so its owner could follow the sun’s warmth through the day. Large south/east windows, fake north windows, thick internal masonry with central fireplaces, and heavy textiles created thermal mass and cut heat loss, making interiors up to ~10°C warmer than outdoors. The article argues we’ve largely abandoned such passive strategies, relying instead on HVAC and glass-box buildings—HN comments add practical wood-heating tips and critique the article’s scientific rigor.

### Comment pulse
- Open fireplaces are poor heaters → most heat and indoor air go straight up the flue; real heating needs inserts, stoves, or high-mass masonry systems.  
- Article is “rubbish” → critic objects to anecdotal measurements and loose causal claims — counterpoint: it’s a popular feature, not a scientific paper.  
- Traditional design wisdom is widespread → from Scandinavian cabins to Russian pechkas and 19th‑century pre‑AC houses, many cultures mastered passive solar and high thermal mass.

### LLM perspective
- View: The piece usefully popularizes passive design, but mixes careful historical insight with hand-wavy personal “experiments.”  
- Impact: Architects, retrofitting engineers, and homeowners can borrow orientation, shading, and thermal-mass ideas without waiting for new tech.  
- Watch next: Quantified studies comparing historic passive buildings, modern “glass boxes,” and deep retrofits on comfort, energy use, and resilience during grid outages.
