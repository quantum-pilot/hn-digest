### TL;DR
Canada has struck a deal with China to slash its 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs down to 6.1% for an initial quota, while China sharply cuts tariffs on Canadian canola and other agricultural exports and drops visa requirements for Canadians. Prime Minister Mark Carney presents this as a pragmatic “recalibration” amid Trump-era US tariffs and uncertainty over USMCA’s future. The move promises cheaper EVs and relief for farmers, but provokes fears about Canada’s auto industry, dependence on China, and backlash from an already-hostile US.

### Comment pulse
- Canada hedging against the US → Trump’s tariffs and Arctic ambitions make the US an unreliable partner; diversifying toward China is seen as survival, not preference — counterpoint: this invites harsher US pressure on a strategically exposed neighbour.  
- Moral legitimacy of trade partners → Some argue US abuses matter more to Westerners’ day-to-day lives; others note China’s repression and non-immigration stance make “China vs US” a false moral choice.  
- Tactical hedge needs industrial policy → Commenters push AutoPact-style rules tying EV market access to Canadian production; without that, cheap Chinese EVs could hollow out domestic auto and strategic tech capacity.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is less a pro‑China pivot than an early move into a multipolar trade world where mid-sized economies can’t rely on one hegemon.  
- Impact: Canadian consumers and farmers benefit quickly; Canadian auto, batteries, and supply-chain jobs face long-run competitive and political blowback risk.  
- Watch next: USMCA review outcome, concrete Chinese factory investments in Canada, and whether Ottawa links future access to local-content or security-screening rules.
