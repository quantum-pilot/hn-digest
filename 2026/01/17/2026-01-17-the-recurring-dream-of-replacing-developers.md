# The recurring dream of replacing developers

### TL;DR
For 50+ years, each wave of “developer-replacing” tech—COBOL, CASE tools, VB/Delphi, web frameworks, low/no‑code, and now AI—has shifted *how* we program, not *whether* we need programmers. Syntax, tooling, and automation keep improving, but the hard part is still thinking through messy business rules, edge cases, integration, and risk. Tools democratize simple cases and raise abstraction levels; they also expand demand and create new backlogs. Leaders should evaluate tools on leverage, not fantasies of eliminating software expertise.

### Comment pulse
- No‑code/AI waves expand demand → more software attempted → more situations where generic tools break, requiring experts to step in and generalize. — counterpoint: strong AI could eventually handle most of this.
- Abstractions in ops (Kubernetes/SRE) and dev don’t erase fundamentals; they create new specialists who must know both low‑level reality and complex tooling.
- Some argue frameworks mainly lower hiring bars and enable mediocre devs; others insist they materially improve maintainability and focus effort on product‑specific logic.

### LLM perspective
- View: Gen‑AI is a fuzzy, non‑verifiable abstraction layer, unlike compilers; it demands *more* human validation, not less.
- Impact: Strongest leverage is for senior engineers, tech leads, and domain experts who can decompose problems and review generated solutions.
- Watch next: Empirical org‑level studies on defect rates, delivery speed, and headcount changes in teams that deeply adopt AI coding tools.
