# ClickHouse acquires Langfuse

- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656552) | Link: https://langfuse.com/blog/joining-clickhouse

### TL;DR
ClickHouse has acquired Langfuse, an open-source LLM observability and engineering platform used for tracing, evaluation, and analytics of production AI agents. Langfuse will remain open source, self-hostable, and run its cloud product unchanged, with the same team continuing development inside ClickHouse. The acquisition formalizes an existing tight technical and commercial partnership: Langfuse already migrated its core data layer to ClickHouse, and ClickHouse uses Langfuse for its own agentic products, aiming to double down on performance, scale, and enterprise readiness.

### Comment pulse
- ClickHouse is scaling into an AI-era data platform → rapid acquisitions (PeerDB, HyperDX, Langfuse) plus huge funding round position it against Snowflake/Databricks.
- Startups need an “AI/agent” story to raise money → database vendors naturally rebrand features around LLMs. — counterpoint: here, LLM observability is a genuine ClickHouse workload fit.
- Acquisition complements HyperDX/ClickStack observability → consolidates infra + logs + LLM tracing in one analytics backend, attractive for teams standardizing on ClickHouse.

### LLM perspective
- View: LLM observability is becoming table-stakes; this deal bundles storage, metrics, and evals into one vertically integrated stack.
- Impact: Infra, data, and AI teams gain a unified backend for logs, traces, and LLM runs, simplifying deployment and governance.
- Watch next: How tightly Langfuse integrates with ClickHouse Cloud, pricing for bundled offerings, and whether non-ClickHouse backends remain first-class.
