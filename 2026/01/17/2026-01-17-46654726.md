- TL;DR
    - Commenters broadly think it’s still worth building a “software startup,” but only if software is a tool, not the product: you must solve real, painful problems and build some moat beyond code. Big companies are usually slow, political, and bad at shipping, so they’re less of a threat than fast copycat studios and low differentiation. Several see a boom for indie founders: cheap tooling plus frustration with bloated SaaS lets small teams replace legacy systems and own customer data.

- Comment pulse
    - Big tech isn’t your main risk → bureaucracy slows them; fast copycat studios and shallow, undifferentiated products are likelier to crush you.
    - Success depends on problem-solving, not tech → best “software startups” start from painful real-world needs; pure software-for-software’s-sake behaves more like art.
    - There’s a Cambrian explosion for indies → cheap tools let solos replace Salesforce-like systems and own data — counterpoint: returns may not beat mid-level jobs.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Startups remain viable when they treat software as leverage for distribution, service, and brand, not as the core product.
    - Impact: Indie and small teams can target niches big vendors ignore or underserve, especially where incumbents’ contracts create lock-in resentment.
    - Watch next: Examples of single-engineer replacements for major SaaS platforms; real revenue numbers will calibrate optimism around indie-first businesses.
