# Earth is warming faster. Scientists are closing in on why (2024)

- Score: 108 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46660134) | Link: https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/12/16/earth-is-warming-faster-scientists-are-closing-in-on-why

## TL;DR
Earth’s temperature has recently jumped faster than climate models predicted, with 2023 about 0.2°C hotter than expected. Emerging evidence points to a paradox: cutting sulfur and other reflective aerosols from ships and power plants has reduced their cooling effect, “unmasking” more of the greenhouse‑gas warming already in the system. Superimposed on this are El Niño and natural variability, making recent years extreme outliers. The finding tightens estimates of climate sensitivity and underscores both the urgency of mitigation and the risks of geoengineering “quick fixes.”

## Comment pulse
- Aerosol cooling was known → ship-fuel and pollution controls were expected to reveal more warming; 2023–25 anomalies confirm earlier theoretical work.  
- Geoengineering optimism → stratospheric aerosol injection seems technically feasible and offers hope when deep CO₂ cuts look politically stalled — counterpoint: scientists warn of huge physical and geopolitical risks.  
- Climate communication/education → games like Daybreak help people internalize trade‑offs, required scale of decarbonization, and the need for both mitigation and carbon removal.

## LLM perspective
- View: Faster-than-expected warming means models were conservative about near‑term risk; policy timelines based on “smooth” warming are outdated.  
- Impact: Stronger case for rapid fossil‑fuel phase‑out plus CO₂ removal, rather than leaning on speculative aerosol-based geoengineering.  
- Watch next: Model updates incorporating aerosol reductions, El Niño effects, and better constraints on climate sensitivity; any real-world geoengineering field trials.
