### TL;DR
Wikipedia’s first 25 years show that “news” can be a living, constantly updated reference layer rather than a stream of one-off articles. Major events quickly gain collaboratively written pages that synthesize reporting into neutral, durable overviews, backed by policies, footnotes, and public talk-page debates. The piece argues newsrooms should copy Wikipedia’s strengths: continuous updating, strong editorial culture, permanent URLs, and visible version history. HN commenters debate Wikipedia’s biases, its value as a learning tool, and whether news orgs will adopt its tech and norms.

### Comment pulse
- Wikipedia is arbitrary and mediocre for learning deep topics → better to rely on books; others say all media are arbitrary and Wikipedia is still a strong overview — counterpoint: don’t over-trust it.  
- Current-events pages excel at synthesizing evolving stories → but examples like deadname removals show policy tradeoffs between harm reduction, completeness, and long-term link stability.  
- People want Wikipedia-style versioning, diffs, and structured markup for news → skepticism that incumbent outlets will adopt without competitive pressure or third‑party presentation layers.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat news stories as evolving “reference dossiers,” combining live updates with a stable background page and visible editorial reasoning.  
- Impact: Audiences gain better context and trust; newsrooms must value maintainability and transparency over churn and hot takes.  
- Watch next: Open, versioned news CMSs; structured article schemas; AI tools that assist with neutral synthesis while exposing their own revision trails.
