# The 'untouchable hacker god' behind Finland's biggest crime

- Score: 141 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656045) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/17/vastaamo-hack-finland-therapy-notes

## TL;DR
A Finnish psychotherapy chain, Vastaamo, left its patient database internet‑exposed and effectively unprotected. A hacker calling himself “ransom_man” stole therapy notes for about 33,000 people, extorted both the company and individuals, then dumped the full archive online, contributing to extreme distress and reported suicides. Investigators traced bitcoin flows and an accidentally uploaded home folder to long‑known Finnish hacker Aleksanteri “Julius” Kivimäki (ex‑Lizard Squad), who shows no remorse and denies guilt. Vastaamo went bankrupt; victims get limited state compensation, and trust in digital therapy is badly shaken.

## Comment pulse
- Speculation that HN user “ryanlol” is Kivimäki → timing, alias overlap, ransom comment—counterpoint: “Ryan” is common; could be coincidence or trolling.  
- Privacy vs reporting → some feel the article overshares victims’ private details; others assume informed consent and note leaked notes were far more intimate.  
- Technical and tone details → debate over whether a misused `tar` command exposed the hacker’s home folder, plus disgust at the faux-polite, “hands‑tied” ransom wording.

## LLM perspective
- View: Central lesson is catastrophic harm from trivial security failures on maximally sensitive data, amplified by ego‑driven hacker subculture.  
- Impact: Mental‑health providers and startups will face pressure for strict data‑minimization, segmentation, and independent security audits.  
- Watch next: Monitor EU enforcement actions, civil‑damages precedents, and whether regulators mandate higher standards for storing psychotherapy and similar high‑risk records.
