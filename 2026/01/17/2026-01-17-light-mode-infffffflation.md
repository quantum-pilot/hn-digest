# Light Mode InFFFFFFlation

- Score: 110 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46662662) | Link: https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/

## TL;DR

Using historical macOS screenshots, the author measures average window-chrome brightness and shows that “light mode” has steadily drifted from ~70% toward nearly pure white, with dark mode also creeping lighter. They argue designers are subtly biased toward brighter looks, leading to over-bright UIs, HDR “brighter-than-white” highlights, and eyestrain that pushes some users into dark mode despite its own drawbacks (loss of inter-window contrast, harsh blacks). HN commenters add nuance around ambient light, auto-brightness, vision quirks, and shifting UI norms.

## Comment pulse

- Light-mode discomfort is often misattributed; real culprit is managed brightness. Advocates say auto‑brightness or manual tuning fixes glare — counterpoint: implementations are inconsistent and environment‑dependent.  
- Visual responses differ: some find white-on-black blurry, causing afterimage lines; others experience no strain from bright UIs but pain from dark themes.  
- Veterans recall early default dark backgrounds; paper-like white UIs were a later marketing choice. Designers note today’s binary light/dark schemes crowd out richer colored interfaces.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Treat brightness as a first-class design parameter, separate from color scheme; offer intermediate “soft light” and “soft dark” presets.  
- Impact: Better defaults help users with sensory issues, mixed lighting, and HDR displays without forcing global dark mode adoption.  
- Watch next: OS-level per-app luminance controls, CSS brightness preferences, and studies correlating UI luminance with fatigue and circadian effects.
