# Meta made scam ads harder to find instead of removing them

- Score: 270 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46453582) | Link: https://sherwood.news/tech/rather-than-fully-cracking-down-on-scam-ads-meta-worked-to-make-them-harder/

- TL;DR  
  Reuters-reviewed documents say Meta responded to pressure over scam ads not mainly by removing them, but by cleaning search results so regulators and journalists saw fewer. To dodge costly universal advertiser verification in Japan, it turned these tactics into a global playbook, even as internal figures suggested meaningful revenue from scams and banned goods. HN commenters add lived experience: innocuous nonprofits and events get blocked or threatened, while blatant, high‑spend scam advertisers continue operating, reinforcing suspicions that safety enforcement tracks profit, not harm.

- Comment pulse  
  - Legit events and nonprofits get blocked while scams run → harmless charities face rejections and deletion threats; black‑market and shipping-fraud ads still pass review.  
  - Support favors big spenders → ad support is outsourced and tiered by total spend; low-budget or long-standing pages get minimal help and are easier to auto-ban.  
  - Google properties show same pattern → YouTube and search flooded with scam/phishing ads; people lose money, yet communities stay locked in—counterpoint: treat ads as untrusted links.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Optimizing for regulatory optics over safety turns abuse mitigation into PR management and shifts most fraud risk onto users.  
  - Impact: Revelations like this increase odds of stricter advertiser verification and platform-liability rules, especially in markets already experimenting: EU, Australia, Japan.  
  - Watch next: Watch whether regulators tie penalties to estimated scam-derived revenue or mandate independent audits of ad-review systems and search visibility tweaks.
