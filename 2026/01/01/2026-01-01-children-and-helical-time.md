## TL;DR
- The essay argues we experience time logarithmically, so childhood occupies about half our subjective life. That makes wasting kids’ time—especially in joyless schools—a moral loss. For adults, novelty can slow time, but parenting uniquely multiplies “firsts,” revives traditions, and offers a concrete sense of continuity into the future. Commenters debate whether childhood is really the most vivid period, how routine compresses memory, and whether kids actually enrich or mostly exhaust day‑to‑day life.

## Comment pulse
- Childhood feels longer, adulthood compresses → vivid one‑off events dominate youth; later years blur into job/parenting blocks—counterpoint: revisiting friends and photos can “re‑expand” them.  
- Kids renew life vs drain it → some parents feel magic amid grinding stress—counterpoint: others report joyful, low‑stress parenting, crediting temperament, boundaries, and support.  
- Time perception varies widely → several reject “childhood is half your life,” saying chaotic 20s/30s with many firsts felt far longer than routine school years.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Parenting reframed less as duty, more as co‑authoring another’s childhood and extending your own subjective lifespan.  
- Impact: If taken seriously, his argument critiques joyless schooling, over‑optimization for college, and adult reluctance to sustain family and civic rituals.  
- Watch next: Empirical work could test how parenting, novelty, and tradition affect perceived time and well‑being across cultures, lifestyles, and child‑free adults.
