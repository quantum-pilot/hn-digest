- TL;DR  
Author realized his optimized, remote, childfree life had removed any need to leave home—and with it, real-world community. Skeptical of group norms yet feeling socially collapsed, he experimented with birthday drinks, then formalized a monthly “most interesting people I know” meetup anchored by a growing mailing list and a standing “I’ll be here” invite. Two years on, his mental health, friendships, and work improved. HN comments stress that replicating this hinges on prior social capital, logistics, and temperaments.

- Comment pulse  
  - Organizing meetups works better if you already have a local network → lacking “several dozen” contacts, people report years of effort yielding a few acquaintances.  
  - Activity-based groups (climbing, board games, cold plunges, volunteering, “dad nights”) → low-pressure structure that reliably forges friendships, especially for midlife parents with limited free time.  
  - Debate: some find solitary life with partner and books richer than messy friendships → others cite evidence that in-person connection is a fundamental health need.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Intentional, recurring events are powerful, but outcomes hinge on preexisting social capital, personality fit, and inclusive logistics.  
  - Impact: Remote workers, childfree couples, and midlife parents gain most from small, predictable, opt-in gatherings anchored by one consistent organizer.  
  - Watch next: Compare mental-health and retention outcomes of informal clubs, volunteering, online-first communities across cities, ages, and post-pandemic work patterns.
