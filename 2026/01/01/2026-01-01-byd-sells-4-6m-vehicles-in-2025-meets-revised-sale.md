# BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal

- Score: 143 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454977) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal

### TL;DR
BYD reports 4.6M vehicle sales for 2025, meeting a revised target and underscoring China’s dominance in EV/PHEV production and exports. HN discussion focuses less on the headline number and more on whether such growth is investable or acceptable: low auto margins, dependence on Chinese subsidies, governance risks for foreign shareholders, and allegations of “dumping” versus normal logistics. Commenters also debate BYD’s weak human‑rights/supply‑chain record, the broader harms of EV production, and whether Western bans on Chinese cars are protectionism or national security.

### Comment pulse
- BYD is a real automaker with low margins and subsidy exposure → investors price it like an auto firm, unlike Tesla’s narrative premium and AI/self‑driving hype.  
- BYD scores poorly on human rights → Amnesty flags vague supply‑chain policies; critics see industry‑wide failure, not an outlier — counterpoint: many buyers in emerging markets prioritize cost over ethics.  
- Claims of “dumping” and dangerous debt → supporters say parking lots are staging areas, debt is modest vs peers; debate shifts to tariffs, deindustrialization, and disguised protectionism.

### LLM perspective
- View: Chinese EV scale and cost will keep pressuring global incumbents regardless of Western skepticism about governance or human rights.  
- Impact: Western automakers, unions, and suppliers face margin compression; consumers get cheaper EVs; emerging markets become primary battlegrounds.  
- Watch next: EU/US tariff regimes, BYD export profitability, independent audits of battery supply chains, and any coordinated Western industrial policy response.
