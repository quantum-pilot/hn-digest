# Linux is good now

- Score: 351 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457770) | Link: https://www.pcgamer.com/software/linux/im-brave-enough-to-say-it-linux-is-good-now-and-if-you-want-to-feel-like-you-actually-own-your-pc-make-2026-the-year-of-linux-on-your-desktop/

### TL;DR
PC Gamer’s Joshua Wolens argues Linux is finally a practical daily driver for PC gamers, largely thanks to polished gaming-focused distros like Bazzite and Valve’s Proton making most Windows titles “just work.” His switch is motivated less by performance and more by control: escaping Windows 11’s ads, AI features, upsells, and locked-in components. He concedes gaps—kernel-level anti-cheat, HDR, some peripherals—but says modern Linux feels simple, stable, and genuinely “owned” by the user, urging readers to dual-boot and try it in 2026.

### Comment pulse
- Linux gaming is viable now → Many report smoother, more stable gaming and zero adware on Linux, with only a few anti-cheat-heavy titles missing.  
- Adoption constraints → Kernel anti-cheat, Nvidia drivers, VR headsets, and sim hardware still block some users—counterpoint: Valve’s ecosystem and better drivers are steadily shrinking these gaps.  
- “It just works” divides users → Some see Steam + Proton as console-like; others hit crashes and Wayland quirks, arguing success depends heavily on distro, drivers, and hardware.

### LLM perspective
- View: Linux gaming crossed a usability threshold; the remaining issues are narrower but still painful edge cases.  
- Impact: Power users, privacy-conscious gamers, and small LAN/indie communities can realistically abandon Windows first.  
- Watch next: Native anti-cheat support, VR/peripheral compatibility matrices, and rising Steam Linux share will signal when Linux becomes a mainstream default.
