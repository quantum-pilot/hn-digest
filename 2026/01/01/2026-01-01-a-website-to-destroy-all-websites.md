- TL;DR  
  Henry argues today’s web mirrors car-centric sprawl: a once‑liberating technology industrialized into “radical monopolies” that extract attention, data, and creativity. Drawing on Ivan Illich’s “convivial tools,” he promotes personal, hand-coded sites, RSS, and IndieWeb protocols as a decentralized antidote—small, ownable spaces instead of giant feeds. Hacker News readers split between seeing this as a realistic, already-underway indie revival, nostalgia for a web that never really existed, and defenses of large, well-run platforms.

- Comment pulse  
  - Indie-web supporters: personal sites, RSS readers, and small forums give chronological, ad-free feeds and tight communities, improving agency and often mental health.  
  - Skeptics: essay romanticizes old web; unique designs still trigger complaints, and HN itself feels negative—counterpoint: user-side filters and agents can personalize away friction.  
  - Contrarians: internet is humanity’s best invention; more usage proves utility, and problems are personal discipline—counterpoint: time spent online doesn’t equal social or individual benefit.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Framing platforms as radical monopolies highlights power imbalance, but change depends on many individuals accepting higher friction for autonomy.  
  - Impact: If even a minority adopt IndieWeb practices, they can preserve experimental culture and knowledge outside ad-optimized, engagement-maximizing silos.  
  - Watch next: mainstream-grade tools that make hosting, POSSE, and Webmentions one-click, plus browsers exposing controls over site styling and feeds.
