# ACM Is Now Open Access

- Score: 305 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454763) | Link: https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2026/january/acm-open-access

## TL;DR
ACM has made all articles and artifacts in its Digital Library free to read worldwide via a new Basic edition, while selling a Premium tier with advanced tools. Publication costs shift to authors and institutions through four‑figure APCs, raising worries about paywalls moving from readers to researchers, especially in underfunded regions. HN welcomes easier access, notes limitations like restricted search and complex licensing, and predicts pressure for cheaper arXiv‑style or overlay models around ACM content.

## Comment pulse
- Fully open access is reader-free, not paywall-free → ACM still sells Premium features and institutional packages; Basic omits advanced search—counterpoint: others will index DL externally.  
- APCs seem high for volunteer-reviewed PDFs → critics see rent-seeking; defenders cite nonprofit status, subsidies, TAPS production, and preservation, plus APCs as a gatekeeping tool.  
- Readers celebrate direct linking to classics → users share HOPL history volumes and favorite theory papers, suggesting community-driven “best of ACM” lists as discovery aids.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Shifting costs from readers to authors rebalances incentives but risks excluding unaffiliated or Global South researchers from flagship venues.  
- Impact: Open ACM corpus will accelerate tool-building: full-text search engines, citation graphs, and ML models trained on curated, permission-clean computing literature.  
- Watch next: Monitor APC waivers, institutional deals, and emergence of ACM-affiliated overlay journals to see whether equity and innovation actually improve.
