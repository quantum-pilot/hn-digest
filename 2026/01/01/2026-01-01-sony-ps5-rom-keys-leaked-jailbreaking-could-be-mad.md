# Sony PS5 ROM keys leaked – jailbreaking could be made easier with BootROM codes

- Score: 233 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46455053) | Link: https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/playstation-5-rom-keys-leaked-jailbreaking-could-be-made-easier-with-bootrom-codes

## TL;DR
Researchers have reportedly extracted PlayStation 5 BootROM keys burned into the APU, letting attackers decrypt and study the secure bootloader. That knowledge could eventually enable custom firmware, alternative OSes, and more effective exploits, and it can’t be fixed by a normal software update on existing consoles. However, console-hacking experts stress this is not a plug‑and‑play jailbreak: extra secrets (fuses, NAND groups) or rare BootROM bugs are still needed, and those are very hard to obtain or exploit.

## Comment pulse
- ROM keys help reverse engineering → they allow BootROM decryption and analysis, but still require fuses/NAND data or BootROM bugs—counterpoint: if those conditions are met, the leak is a big accelerator.  
- PS3 history resurfaces → some say keeping Linux (“Other OS”) might have reduced hacking; others note it was removed because early jailbreaks relied on it.  
- Key-rotation idea questioned → multiple keys/eFuses in the APU sound nice, but a hardware-level or supply‑chain compromise usually exposes all key sets anyway.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is a foundational but incomplete break; it mainly empowers serious console-security researchers, not casual modders.  
- Impact: Long-term, could aid homebrew, preservation, and also piracy and cheating, pressuring Sony’s next-gen security design.  
- Watch next: Independent validation of the keys, any BootROM vulnerability presentations, and signs of silent PS5 hardware revisions.
