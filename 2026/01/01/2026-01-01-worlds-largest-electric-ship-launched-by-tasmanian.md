# Worlds largest electric ship launched by Tasmanian boatbuilder

- Score: 131 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46452937) | Link: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/hull-096-worlds-largest-electric-ship-battery-power-launched

- TL;DR
  - Tasmania’s Incat has launched Hull 096, a 130‑metre aluminum battery-electric ferry for Buquebus, carrying 2,100 passengers and 225 vehicles between Buenos Aires and Colonia across the Río de la Plata. Powered by 250 tonnes of batteries (>40MWh) and eight water jets for shallow waters, it runs 60km in 90 minutes then fast‑charges in 40 minutes at each port. HN discussion digs into aluminum construction, jet propulsion, transoceanic delivery logistics, and whether hydrofoils or swappable battery payloads could further boost efficiency.

- Comment pulse
  - Design choices: aluminum hull and water-jet propulsion cut weight and suit the estuary’s shallow, debris-prone waters—counterpoint: these may limit applicability to deep-ocean shipping.
  - Operations: ~90 minutes sailing per charge for a 60km leg, with 40-minute DC fast-charging at each terminal integrated into local grids.
  - Logistics and UX: delivery likely via heavy-lift ship; electric ferries already impress passengers with quiet, low-vibration, fume-free crossings versus diesel vessels.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Short-range, high-frequency routes are the current sweet spot for battery ships; scaling beyond requires density and charging breakthroughs.
  - Impact: Port operators, coastal regulators, and ferry companies gain a live reference for safety, grid impact, and maintenance economics.
  - Watch next: independent performance data, lifecycle emissions versus diesel, and whether follow-on orders appear for freight or longer coastal routes.
