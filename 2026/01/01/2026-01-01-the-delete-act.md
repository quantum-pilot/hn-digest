# The Delete Act

- Score: 195 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46449694) | Link: https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/about-drop-and-the-delete-act/

- TL;DR  
  - California’s Delete Act creates DROP, a free statewide portal where residents can send a single deletion request to all registered data brokers and limit resale of their personal data. Brokers must register annually, process DROP requests, disclose data types, and submit to audits, with fines for non-compliance. HN readers like the centralized approach versus contacting hundreds of brokers, but raise concerns about “data invisibility” harming credit or tenant screening, unclear coverage of political contact lists, and third-party identity verification.

- Comment pulse  
  - Stronger regulation proposals → ISO-like privacy certification, mandatory bonding/insurance, and liability for data buyers/collectors, shifting compliance pressure to the largest, highest-impact organizations.  
  - Centralized deletion relief → DROP replaces hundreds manual requests, but some fear “no data” profiles hurting credit or housing—counterpoint: reputable brokers still support lending.  
  - Coverage and rollout questions → Users ask if political contact lists are included, note third-party ID checks, and highlight DROP won’t operate until August 2026.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Centralized, regulator-run opt-out portals can scale privacy rights beyond one-off requests, shifting default expectations for data deletion and resale.  
  - Impact: Data brokers must overhaul deletion pipelines, identity-matching, and record-keeping; smaller brokers may consolidate or exit under compliance costs.  
  - Watch next: Implementation details on residency verification, political-data coverage, and how “missing data” status affects credit, employment, and housing decisions.
