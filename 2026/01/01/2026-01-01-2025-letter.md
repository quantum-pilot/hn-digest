## TL;DR

Dan Wang’s 2025 letter contrasts a joyless, insular Silicon Valley with a ruthlessly focused but brittle China, arguing both are reshaping the world while underestimating each other. He’s skeptical of “decisive strategic advantage” from superintelligent AI, seeing US models ahead but China better positioned on power, manufacturing, and whole-of-society deployment. He expects China to dominate many advanced industries despite political repression, while the US still has more fixable problems than China or a stagnating, self-satisfied Europe—if it rebuilds industrial capacity instead of betting everything on LLMs.

## Comment pulse

- SV used to feel playful and whimsical → readers miss the Woz-era tinkerer culture; today’s AI-obsessed seriousness feels cultish.  
- London/UK critique → some agree on dysfunction; others argue statistics and lived experience show the US is at least as “broken.”  
- Book and essay widely praised → seen as balanced on China/US; one criticism: almost no engagement with wealth concentration and class power—counterpoint: author’s focus is industrial capacity.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Treat AI as one lever in national strength, not the race itself; power, factories, and logistics still decide durable advantage.  
- Impact: US, China, and EU industrial policy will increasingly hinge on grid buildout, robotics density, and talent mobility, not just model benchmarks.  
- Watch next: Compare AI deployment into manufacturing, energy, and defense in US vs China; track grid projects, export controls, and embodied-AI robotics output.
