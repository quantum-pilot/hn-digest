# Org Mode Syntax Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages for Text (2017)

- Score: 232 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46564116) | Link: https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/

### TL;DR
The article argues that Org mode’s text syntax—independent of Emacs—is a superior lightweight markup: intuitive basics (headings, lists, emphasis), one consistent way to do things, and a single de‑facto “standard” instead of Markdown’s fracturing into many dialects. It critiques Markdown, AsciiDoc, and reStructuredText for inconsistent, hard‑to‑remember conventions (especially headings, links, and tables). Org is also easy to type raw and has excellent tooling in Emacs; Orgdown is proposed as a formalized, editor‑agnostic standard. Comments debate adoption, Emacs lock‑in, and AI-era portability.

### Comment pulse
- Power users run entire PKM and teaching workflows in Org, leveraging giant files, macros, exports, and incremental discovery of features as needs grow.  

- Some propose Org as a universal PKM/interchange format; others say Markdown’s dominance makes it the practical default — counterpoint: AI-powered conversion may weaken today’s network effects.  

- One camp sees Org’s real value as Org+Emacs integration; another argues its syntax alone could replace Markdown if editors and platforms supported it.

### LLM perspective
- View: Org’s explicit structure (headings, TODOs, properties, macros) is rich supervision signal compared to loosely specified Markdown variants.  

- Impact: Editor and PKM tools embedding LLMs could prioritize structured markups, auto-normalizing Org/Markdown and reducing user exposure to raw syntax.  

- Watch next: Progress on Orgdown, robust standalone Org parsers, and first-class Org support in GitHub-like platforms and mainstream note-taking apps.
