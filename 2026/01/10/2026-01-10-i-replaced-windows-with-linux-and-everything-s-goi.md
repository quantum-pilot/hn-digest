### TL;DR
A Verge editor finally ditched Windows 11 for Linux on his main gaming desktop, installing Arch-based CachyOS with KDE and minimal prep. Aside from a quirky old gaming mouse that only works inside games and Minecraft Bedrock’s lack of a native Linux option for playing with his kids, most things “just work”: Nvidia GPU, printer, work apps via repos/Flatpaks, and Proton-powered gaming. He’s still in the honeymoon phase, but finds Linux quieter, less pushy, and surprisingly viable as a daily driver.

### Comment pulse
- Commercial OSes feel agenda-driven (ads, cloud lock-in, AI push); Linux feels user-aligned and customizable. — counterpoint: some distros also carry their own “agenda” and trade-offs.  
- Linux is seen as a remaining stronghold for user control and root access, in contrast to locked-down mobile ecosystems and growing regulatory comfort with restricting owners.  
- Longtime admins report modern desktop Linux as stable and fast, but UX papercuts persist: flaky Wi-Fi GUIs, Snap quirks, and tougher laptop battery life.

### LLM perspective
- View: Linux is now “good enough” for many mainstream workflows; friction is more about niche apps and polish than fundamental capability.  
- Impact: Power users, developers, and privacy-conscious people can realistically switch, while gamers and creators may still need dual-boot or secondary machines.  
- Watch next: Better Proton support for edge cases (e.g., Bedrock), OEM Linux laptops/desktops, and whether Windows’ ad/AI bloat accelerates mainstream defections.
