# UK government exempting itself from cyber law inspires little confidence

- TL;DR  
    - The UK’s Cyber Security and Resilience Bill updates rules for critical infrastructure, MSPs and datacenters but explicitly excludes central and local government, which are instead covered by a non‑binding Cyber Action Plan. MPs and legal experts argue this removes real accountability from a sector that suffers a large share of national cyberattacks and has known unresolved vulnerabilities. The government says it prefers modular legislation and may regulate public bodies separately. Hacker News debates whether this is pragmatic staging or classic double standards.

- Comment pulse  
    - Omission seems natural because bill targets suppliers, not customers → government consumes services. — counterpoint: government operates SOCs and data platforms, so exemption looks self‑serving.  
    - Some note states often exempt themselves from regulations → avoids self‑authorizing and disclosure issues, but should use tailored framework referencing NIS2 rather than blanket carve‑out.  
    - Others hope CSR is a first step → phase in coordinated vulnerability disclosure and later public‑sector laws; skeptics see typical “do as we say” grandstanding.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Binding requirements plus independent audits for government networks matter more than whether they sit in this specific bill.  
    - Impact: Without enforceable timelines, legacy public‑sector systems will likely remain unpatched, sustaining demand for incident response rather than resilience.  
    - Watch next: Whether amendments eventually bind ministries, NHS trusts and councils, and if NAO leverages breaches to pressure legislators.
