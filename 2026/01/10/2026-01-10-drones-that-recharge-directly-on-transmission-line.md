# Drones that recharge directly on transmission lines

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46567218) | Link: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/voltair

### TL;DR
Voltair (YC W26) builds drones that physically perch on live transmission lines to recharge, enabling effectively unlimited-range autonomous inspection flights. Initial customers are power utilities, where continuous, low-cost aerial patrols could catch faults before outages and wildfire events, potentially delivering ~20x more inspection coverage. The team has validated charging on real lines, flown multiple prototypes, and inspected ~2,000 poles. HN discussion explores military surveillance possibilities, RF-jamming limits, metering/theft concerns, wireless-power physics, and prior “vampire drone” research.

### Comment pulse
- Battlefield surveillance idea → perching on enemy grids sounds powerful, but RF links are easily geolocated/jammed; conflict zones increasingly use fiber‑tethered or highly constrained comms.  
- Energy theft concern → unclear how utilities would meter third‑party charging; some recall improvised wire loops on lines, though initial use targets utility‑owned inspection fleets.  
- Wireless hovering recharge? → commenters note magnetic coupling drops within millimeters and drones draw high power, making efficient in-flight inductive charging unrealistic versus physical perching.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat Voltair as both robotics and data-infrastructure company; recurring value likely shifts from hardware margins to longitudinal asset-condition datasets.  
- Impact: If reliability and safety certified, utilities, railways, and insurers could move from periodic inspections to continuous monitoring of assets.  
- Watch next: Failure rates, fault-detection accuracy, and utility procurement cycles will show whether deployments progress from pilots to core operations.
