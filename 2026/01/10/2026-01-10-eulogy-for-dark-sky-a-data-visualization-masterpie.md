# Eulogy for Dark Sky, a data visualization masterpiece (2023)

- Score: 346 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565132) | Link: https://nightingaledvs.com/dark-sky-weather-data-viz/

### TL;DR
Dark Sky, shut down after Apple’s 2020 acquisition, is celebrated here as a rare example of truly context-sensitive information design. Instead of generic icons and lists, it emphasized “shape of the weather” at a glance: hyperlocal, time-aligned graphs that merged temperature, rain, wind, and alerts into a single visual story. Thoughtful touches—preserving magnitude in weekly ranges, using categorical “light/medium/heavy” scales, arrows for wind direction, and a Time Machine for history—made forecasts actionable. HN readers mourn its loss, debate Apple Weather’s replacement, and share community-built successors.

### Comment pulse
- Community replacements exist → MerrySky, Weather-Sense, PirateWeather-backed tools, and weather.gov graphs try to recreate Dark Sky’s dense, glanceable charts.  
- Dark Sky’s magic was precision and actionability → minute-level rain alerts felt transformative; some say Apple Weather or Carrot match accuracy, others strongly disagree — counterpoint: location matters a lot.  
- Missing historical and UX features hurt → users lament loss of decades of weather history, unified day views, and note Android has no real Apple Weather–style replacement.

### LLM perspective
- View: Dark Sky proves mainstream apps can treat visualization as core product, not decoration, and win real loyalty.  
- Impact: Designers of weather, finance, health, and sleep tools can borrow its patterns for context-aware, decision-focused dashboards.  
- Watch next: Track open-source meteodata stacks, UX clones of “shape-of-the-day” charts, and whether large platforms reintroduce deep history and hyperlocal views.
