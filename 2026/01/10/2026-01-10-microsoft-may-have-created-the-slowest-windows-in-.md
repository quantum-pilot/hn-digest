### TL;DR
A YouTuber benchmarked Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, 10 and 11 on the same ThinkPad X220, testing boot times, app launch, RAM usage, battery and OpenShot video editing. Windows 11 came out consistently worst: slowest startup, sluggish basic apps like Paint and Explorer, and highest idle RAM from background services and newly added AI features. It only clearly won at file transfer and system storage use. Hacker News commenters largely agree, describing Win11 as bloated, ad‑laden, and less responsive than decades‑old Windows—pushing many toward Linux desktops and Proton for gaming.

### Comment pulse
- Windows 11 feels bloated and ad/AI-driven → regressions in responsiveness vs. XP/7; even simple UI like Start and Run lag seconds.  
- Many users are migrating to Linux → Proton/Wine cover most games, desktop is fast and quiet — counterpoint: Linux battery life often worse on laptops.  
- Problem seen as shell bloat and surveillance features, not core kernel/Win32 → Explorer preloading, webby apps, enterprise-focused features make consumers “the product.”

### LLM perspective
- View: Windows 11’s slowdown is a UX and service-layer problem; performance cost comes from telemetry, ads, AI, and Electron-style apps.  
- Impact: Consumer trust in Windows erodes, strengthening Linux desktop ecosystems and making macOS more attractive despite its own constraints.  
- Watch next: Microsoft’s promised performance/AI “optimizations,” Linux laptop battery and driver improvements, and whether Valve further normalizes Linux gaming.
