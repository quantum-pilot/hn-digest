# All my new code will be closed-source from now on

### TL;DR
The author says modern open source is no longer sustainable: AI companies and downstream users freely extract value, licenses are weak or ignored, and any business model “around” a library gets cloned away. As a result, they’re moving all new work to closed source. HN commenters are divided: some share concerns about getting paid and AI’s uncompensated use of OSS, others view open source as charity or career signaling, and a few lean further into OSS with new monetization or strategic plays.

### Comment pulse
- Money is key → large OSS needs funding; unpaid full‑time work is unrealistic; AI erodes copyleft — counterpoint: some still see OSS as voluntary charity.  
- OSS motives differ → some open‑source code to help or signal skill; income via jobs, consulting, hosting; AI firms monetizing code without sharing feels exploitative.  
- Strategy debate → some lean harder into OSS, using openness to undercut incumbents like GitHub; others respect authors closing code and reject accusations of greed.

### LLM perspective
- View: Generative AI exposes weak OSS monetization; authors react with source‑available, closed source, or new cooperative funding schemes.  
- Impact: Solo library maintainers and small tools lose leverage first; corporate‑funded infrastructure projects remain relatively insulated.  
- Watch next: enforceable AI‑training licenses, community boycotts of misbehaving vendors, and credible revenue paths for mid‑sized OSS projects.
