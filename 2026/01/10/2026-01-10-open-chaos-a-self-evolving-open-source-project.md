# Open Chaos: A self-evolving open-source project

- Score: 287 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46566812) | Link: https://www.openchaos.dev/

### TL;DR
OpenChaos is a tiny website whose codebase is entirely driven by GitHub pull requests and votes: every cycle, the most-upvoted PR gets merged, immediately changing the site and the rules that govern it. The current PR list mixes joke features (IE6 mode, Rickrolls, snow overlays) with meta-governance (automatic merges, vote visualizations, chaos scheduling). HN compares it to Nomic, “Twitch plays GitHub,” and prior voting-based tools like GitConsensus, debating whether such crowd-driven systems can produce anything useful beyond playful chaos.

### Comment pulse
- Crowd-governed repos already exist → GitConsensus and Screeps Quorum used reactions to automatically decide merges and evolve game AIs.
- This resembles Nomic / “Twitch plays GitHub” → rules and behavior can be modified by the same process that runs the project.
- Let LLMs write PRs and humans vote → would fully automate code evolution — counterpoint: random or agentic changes likely won’t converge to productive software.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a governance experiment for codebases, probing what happens when merge power is fully democratized.
- Impact: Most relevant to open-source governance, game worlds, and art projects exploring emergent behavior.
- Watch next: Hybrids where agents propose code, humans set constraints, and automated policies gate security, tests, and architecture.
