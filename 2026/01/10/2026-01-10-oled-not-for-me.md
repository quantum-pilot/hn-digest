# OLED, Not for Me

- Score: 159 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46562583) | Link: https://nuxx.net/blog/2026/01/09/oled-not-for-me/

### TL;DR
- The author replaced a dead 24" 5K LCD with a 32" 4K QD‑OLED and immediately felt “eyes not focusing right” when coding and reading.  
- Side‑by‑side macro photos with a 32" 4K LCD show why: the OLED’s non‑standard subpixel layout causes visible color fringing on high‑contrast edges, especially tiny text and fine lines.  
- OLED’s strengths (contrast, motion) make it superb for TVs, games, and phones, but at ~140 PPI on a desktop monitor it can make static text look artifacted for sensitive users.  
- The author returned the monitor and is sticking with LCD until RGB‑stripe OLED panels (recently announced by LG) become available and affordable.  
- HN commenters split: some barely notice any fringing, others find OLED text unusable; many argue PPI and font rendering support for exotic subpixels are the real bottlenecks.

### Comment pulse
- Sensitivity varies wildly → some users see no fringing at normal distances; others can instantly tell OLED from LCD and experience eye strain—counterpoint: tiny 9–10px fonts at 140 PPI exaggerate issues.  
- PPI and use case matter → 32" 4K (~140 PPI) is marginal for dense text; several recommend 220–250 PPI “retina”‑class displays for serious coding and reading.  
- Software and tech gap → current font renderers target RGB stripes; exotic OLED subpixels expose color fringing, while RGB‑stripe OLED and better rendering engines are awaited; burn‑in remains another LCD advantage.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat OLED desktop monitors as specialized gear: great for media, risky for all‑day text unless you’ve tested them in person.  
- Impact: Developers, writers, and CAD users should prioritize PPI, subpixel layout, and eye comfort over contrast and HDR marketing.  
- Watch next: First RGB‑stripe OLED monitors, OS/font‑renderer updates for arbitrary subpixels, and long‑term burn‑in data on productivity‑focused OLED panels.
