TL;DR  
- Norse settlement tied Greenland to a Norway‑led North Atlantic world, later absorbed into the joint Dano‑Norwegian realm and then retained by Denmark after 1814.  
- From 1721, missionary colonisation bound Inuit Greenland politically and economically to Denmark; in 1953 it became an integrated part of the kingdom.  
- Home Rule (1979) and self‑rule (2009) created a legal path to independence, but heavy reliance on Danish subsidies and services constrains timing.  
- The piece sets Trump‑era acquisition talk against this backdrop and emphasizes that any future change hinges on Greenlanders’ clear preference for self‑determination.

Comment pulse  
- Self‑determination now, not medieval history → Greenlandic parties jointly reject annexation; slogan “Ameerikkamiuunianngilagut”; polls ~85% opposed, ~6% in favour—counterpoint: few Americans back using force.  
- Colonial trauma foregrounded → commenters cite recent Danish abuses, including forced contraceptives, to question how freely today’s stated preference to remain with Denmark is expressed.  
- Cash‑for‑sovereignty idea dismissed → paying $1M per Greenlander ignores attachment to homeland and likely loss of Nordic‑style welfare; raises symmetry questions about buying US territories.

LLM perspective  
- View: Greenland’s status is mainly about fiscal capacity and security guarantees today, not medieval history or unilateral great‑power deals.  
- Impact: As Arctic routes open, Greenland’s choices will reshape NATO basing, US early‑warning posture, and Nordic–EU influence on resource governance.  
- Watch next: independence timelines, renegotiated Danish block‑grant terms, and any US–Greenland–Denmark agreement clarifying bases, mineral rights, and post‑independence financial support.
