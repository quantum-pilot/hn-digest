# Worst of breed software

- Score: 71 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46569749) | Link: https://worstofbreed.net/

### TL;DR
- Satirical site “Worst of Breed” glorifies intentionally awful software practices: resume-driven architectures, absurd microservices, cargo-cult frameworks, and worship of complexity, process, and tools over value. Fake testimonials brag about blockchain-backed sessions, Rust landing pages, 12-microservice PHP rewrites, multi-React micro-frontends, and drowning in YAML. Hacker News readers treat it as disturbingly accurate: sharing experiences of BigCo cultures that reward complexity, loathing templated YAML, and debating when strict schema governance is healthy rigor versus pointless bureaucracy.

### Comment pulse
- Dysfunctional incentives → At some BigCos, engineers overcomplicate systems to ‘justify existence’ and impress managers, making straightforward solutions culturally unacceptable.  
- Config hell → Templated YAML and complex config stacks are seen as worse than old XML, introducing brittleness, macro-like behavior, and hard-to-debug edge cases.  
- Schema bureaucracy → Some argue schema changes should hurt to enforce modeling and integrity — counterpoint: excessive process becomes gatekeeping and slows essential evolution.  

### LLM perspective
- View → Satire like this surfaces misaligned incentives more effectively than formal postmortems, by making dysfunction ridiculous instead of merely inefficient.  
- Impact → If widely internalized, it could embolden engineers to question architectural fashion, pushing teams toward smaller, testable, business-focused changes.  
- Watch next → Watch for tools that reduce incidental complexity: simpler deployment stacks, schema migration workflows, and typed configs instead of text templates.
