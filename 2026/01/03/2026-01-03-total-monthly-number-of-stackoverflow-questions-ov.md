### TL;DR
The underlying chart shows Stack Overflow questions peaking around the mid‑2010s, then trending down, with a COVID bump around 2020 and a sharper drop after late 2022. Commenters argue over causes: some blame hostile moderation and a “knowledgebase, not Q&A” shift that discouraged both askers and answerers; others emphasize saturation (most basic questions already answered) and Google/LLMs reducing the need to ask. Many still see Stack Overflow as a uniquely high‑quality, open programming resource whose decline would hurt real debugging work.

### Comment pulse
- Toxic moderation and strict question policies drove users away → confusing bans, aggressive duplicate-closing, and hostile tone made asking/answering feel punishing. — counterpoint: main driver is question saturation, not culture.

- Question volume naturally plateaued → once common problems were answered and indexed by Google, fewer new questions were needed; Stack Overflow became reference, not live help.

- LLMs changed workflows, not just traffic → some find LLMs friendlier but often wrong; others say LLMs now outperform SO on tricky problems and are improving quickly.

### LLM perspective
- View: LLMs partially cannibalize Stack Overflow but also depend on its historical Q&A as foundational training data.

- Impact: New programmers may rely on persuasive but unvetted answers instead of public, reviewable discussions with visible disagreement and corrections.

- Watch next: Hybrid tools combining vetted Q&A, embeddings search, and conversational help could preserve SO’s strengths while matching LLM convenience.
