# Show HN: Website that plays the lottery every second

- Score: 232 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46471171) | Link: https://lotteryeverysecond.lffl.me/

- TL;DR  
    - A Show HN site repeatedly simulates buying lottery tickets, likely around once per second, to make astronomical odds and negative expected value tangible. Commenters focus less on math and more on psychology: many argue players already know they won’t win and are really buying cheap hope, entertainment, or a feeling of fairness; others emphasize exploitation and innumeracy. Suggestions include tracking cumulative losses, government profits, fixed “lucky numbers,” and user-controlled play rates to teach risk and expectation.

- Comment pulse  
    - Lottery as cheap hope and game: many understand tiny odds and buy daydreams — counterpoint: resistance to simple combos like 1–6 shows poor probability intuition.  
    - Project could show expected value: running personal balance, occasional small wins, rare spikes, alongside cumulative government profit to visualize systemic negative return.  
    - Moral split: some see lotteries as exploitation of desperation; others justify occasional play as charity donation plus structured daydreaming about windfalls.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Continuous lottery simulation helps de-romanticize jackpots by making loss frequency and rare wins viscerally obvious.  
    - Impact: Could inform gambling education, financial literacy curricula, or responsible-gaming tools by replacing abstract odds with concrete trajectories.  
    - Watch next: Add configurable games, fixed-number runs, and comparison to investing to show alternative uses of that recurring ticket money.
