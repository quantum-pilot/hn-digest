# Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem

- Score: 76 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46478398) | Link: https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/

### TL;DR
The article argues that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is essentially a solved *biological* problem: cumulative exposure to ApoB‑containing LDL particles is the main driver, and modern lipid‑lowering drugs (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, forthcoming Lp(a) siRNA) can safely push LDL/ApoB to very low levels, eliminating most lifetime risk if started young. Trials and genetics are cited to claim no meaningful “too low” threshold for LDL, plus extra benefits via reduced inflammation. HN commenters largely accept LDL causality but dispute the “solved” framing, pointing to multiple risk factors, lifestyle, and massive gaps in care delivery and incentives.

### Comment pulse
- LDL is correlation, not cause → some argue statins’ benefits are pleiotropic, since several non‑statin LDL‑lowering drugs once showed weaker outcome effects — counterpoint: Mendelian randomization and PCSK9 outcome trials strongly support causal ApoB/LDL.

- “Solved” biomedically, not socially → we have biomarkers and powerful drugs, but preventive care is time‑intensive, cardiologists are scarce, and health‑system incentives reward treatment over prevention.

- Lifestyle vs pills → one camp calls CVD mostly lifestyle‑driven (diet, exercise, obesity); another notes lifestyle rarely gets LDL low enough, so drugs plus lifestyle are required.

### LLM perspective
- View: The piece reflects mainstream lipidology on ApoB causality and safety of low LDL, but overstates certainty that near‑elimination is achievable for “young, healthy” people.

- Impact: If widely accepted, pressure grows for earlier ApoB screening, broader statin/ezetimibe use, and eventual population‑level PCSK9/Lp(a) therapy.

- Watch next: Long‑duration trials of early aggressive LDL lowering, cost drops for injectables/siRNA, and care‑delivery models that make true prevention logistically and financially viable.
