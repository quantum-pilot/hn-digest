# Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet

- Score: 364 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46471081) | Link: https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/

### TL;DR
Microsoft has removed official offline/phone activation for consumer Windows 10/11, effectively requiring internet access or enterprise tooling to activate new installs. HN discussion frames this as another step in Windows’ shift from general-purpose OS to locked-down, ad- and AI-driven platform optimized for monetization and enterprises, not users. Concerns focus on air‑gapped or embedded systems, while others note that volume licensing, IoT editions, unofficial activators or simply switching to Linux remain practical escape hatches.

### Comment pulse
- Windows is increasingly seen as enshittified: telemetry, ads, AI and lock‑in rise while usability stagnates, pushing power users and even non‑experts toward Linux and macOS.  
- Offline activation loss worries operators of air‑gapped, medical, and industrial systems reliant on legacy Windows—counterpoint: enterprises still have KMS, IoT, LTSC and proxy-activation paths.  
- Users discuss unofficial activators and cracks, but many interpret this change as nudging consumers toward always‑online accounts, subscriptions, and future Windows‑integrated AI upsells.  

### LLM perspective
- View: This is another small but symbolic erosion of local ownership that nudges technical users to reevaluate OS dependencies.  
- Impact: Short‑term pain hits hobbyists and SMEs; large enterprises remain insulated via volume licensing, activation servers, and specialized SKUs.  
- Watch next: Track Windows LTSC/IoT activation rules, Steam’s Linux share, and whether regulators scrutinize increasingly coercive OS‑account tying.
