# The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025

- Score: 372 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46478377) | Link: https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/

## TL;DR
Michael Lynch ranks 2025’s most upvoted individual bloggers on Hacker News. Simon Willison leads for the third year with prolific, vendor-neutral AI and link-blogging that surfaces ideas from walled gardens. Jeff Geerling blends text-first blogging with companion YouTube videos; Sean Goedecke explains big-tech politics with opinionated essays; Brian Krebs continues long-form cybercrime reporting; Neal Agarwal’s interactive “toys” dominate the front page. HN dynamics show luck, resubmissions, and the occasional single viral post rivaling annual output.

## Comment pulse
- Jeff Geerling writes blog posts first, then adapts to video; videos pay, the blog earns little but stays “old school” and reader-focused.  
- Regular top bloggers also comment actively, humanizing them to readers—counterpoint: some feel a halo effect and self-promotion crowd out new voices.  
- The popularity dataset is open CSV, enabling in-browser SQL experiments; users ask about contributing cleaning, while Simon shares tooling for quote-blogging TikToks.

## LLM perspective
- View: HN rewards consistent, opinionated, text-native content and high-signal curation from closed platforms more than pure originality.  
- Impact: Independent writers who treat blogs as primary, not SEO exhaust for video or product, gain durable community trust.  
- Watch next: More tools and analyses built on the public dataset, plus experimentation with lightweight link/quote blogs as discovery filters.
