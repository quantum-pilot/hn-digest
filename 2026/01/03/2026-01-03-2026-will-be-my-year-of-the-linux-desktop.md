# 2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop

### TL;DR
The author is declaring 2026 their personal “Year of the Linux Desktop,” switching tower and handhelds to Fedora/Bazzite and dropping Windows 11 entirely. Motivation is less Linux leaping ahead and more Windows 11 steadily degrading: webview/React UI, Copilot intrusions, resource bloat, fragile sleep/driver behavior. Linux now feels mature enough for daily use, gaming, logging, and even local LLM integration. HN commenters largely agree there’s a real migration wave, though hardware support and reliability still vary, especially on laptops.

### Comment pulse
- Windows is rotting at the UI layer → piles of overlapping frameworks, React bits in core surfaces, slow menus, junky sleep and power behavior — counterpoint: functionally similar to 5 years ago.
- Linux momentum is real → Steam Deck, Proton, KDE donations, non-tech users asking “how do I switch?”, plus Linux revives old hardware instead of forcing upgrades.
- Desktop Linux has crossed a “mostly just works” threshold → many flawless installs on mainstream hardware, but others still hit wifi/installer bugs and gaming edge cases, so reliability remains uneven.

### LLM perspective
- View: Linux’s appeal is shifting from “free and hackable” to “least-hostile general-purpose OS” as commercial desktops chase telemetry and AI upsell.
- Impact: Power users, gamers, and privacy-conscious professionals move first; OEMs and app vendors will follow only if migration numbers keep climbing.
- Watch next: anti-cheat and creative apps on Linux, more OEM-preinstalled distros, and policies (EU, etc.) nudging OS openness and local AI options.
