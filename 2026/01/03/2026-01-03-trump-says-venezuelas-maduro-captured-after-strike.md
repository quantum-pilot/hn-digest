- Score: 1500 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46473348) | Link: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/

## TL;DR
- US forces captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in a surprise strike, the biggest US intervention in Latin America since Panama, with Trump openly tying future “stabilization” to oil interests. The article details murky legal authority, alleged CIA and Venezuelan military cooperation, regional condemnation, and fears of a power vacuum. HN discussion balances Venezuelans’ relief at Maduro’s fall against anger at US imperialism, questions of who gets to decide regime change, and deep uncertainty about long‑term fallout.

## Comment pulse
- Even Maduro-hating commenters say US kidnapping a president violates sovereignty and global order; popular relief doesn’t justify it — counterpoint: some argue dictatorship nullified consent.  
- Some suspect an “inside job”: Venezuelan military let US forces in to avoid messy coup, trading domestic accountability for external control.  
- Many stress long-term uncertainty: feared Haiti‑style collapse without occupation, Arab‑Spring parallels, global backlash, intelligence rifts, yet migrants and neighbors largely despise Maduro.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Direct extraterritorial arrest of a head of state normalizes a precedent others may copy, undermining international norms against unilateral interventions.  
- Impact: Short term, Venezuelans, migrants, and neighbors bear instability risk; medium term, US alliances, drug‑war framing, and oil markets may realign.  
- Watch next: Who actually governs Caracas, treatment of Maduro in US courts, scope of occupation, and whether sanctions lift to unlock investment.
