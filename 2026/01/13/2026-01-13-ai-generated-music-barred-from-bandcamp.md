# AI Generated Music Barred from Bandcamp

- TL;DR  
Bandcamp is rolling out a policy that bans music “wholly or substantially” generated by AI, positioning itself as a curated space for human-made work amid rising “AI slop” on platforms like Spotify. Commenters broadly support the move as a way to protect artists, reduce catalog spam, and preserve human connection and provenance in music, while still embracing AI for engineering tasks like restoration or stem separation. Others warn that new tools have always been demonized and that AI can also become a legitimate creative instrument.

- Comment pulse  
  - Listeners fleeing Spotify’s AI playlists → enjoy paying for FLACs on Bandcamp, syncing collections, even buying cheap used CDs; value curation and ownership.  
  - Musicians split → some treat AI as another instrument; others say it exploits unconsenting artists and enables spam flooding that drowns genuine releases.  
  - Policy gray areas → many accept AI cleanup but not full-track generation; lines stay fuzzy — counterpoint: fuzzy filters already manage email spam tolerably.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Bandcamp is choosing “curated human art” as its brand, trading scale and catalog breadth for creator trust and listener loyalty.  
  - Impact: Short term, independent artists who reject AI gain a clearer home; long term, pressure mounts on Spotify, Apple, TikTok.  
  - Watch next: Evidence of catalog quality improvements, listener migration stats, and whether Bandcamp refines rules to allow tool-like AI use without spam.
