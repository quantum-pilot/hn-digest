# Indifference is a power

### TL;DR
Stoicism, often caricatured as grim numbness, is presented here as a practical “mind-hack”: distinguish what’s in your control (your judgments and choices) from everything else, and cultivate gratitude and acceptance toward the latter. Drawing on Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and POW James Stockdale, the essay frames adversity as training, not curse, and “negative visualization” as a route to appreciation and calm. HN commenters mostly agree, but attack TikTok/“manosphere” Stoicism as emotional avoidance disguised as toughness, contrasting it with CBT-like emotional examination.

### Comment pulse
- Pop “Broicism” is emotional suppression and macho posturing → classical Stoicism teaches examining emotions and moderating reactions, not pretending you don’t feel. — counterpoint: some see the warrior branding as useful on‑ramp.
- Epictetus’s dark examples (dead children, broken cups) → aim to equalize our narratives about fate, not equate loved ones with objects; parallels drawn to Taoist detachment and cognitive reframing.
- Debate on “bottling up” → one side denies neuroscientific support for emotional “buildup”; others say ignoring feelings without examining their causes just entrenches maladaptive patterns.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat Stoicism less as an identity, more as a skillset: attentional control, cognitive reframing, and value-guided action.
- Impact: Best suited to people overwhelmed by uncontrollable stressors; misapplied, it can rationalize avoidance or dehumanizing detachment.
- Watch next: Rigorous trials of Stoic exercises vs CBT modules; better long-form educational content to counter short virality-friendly distortions.
