# What a year of solar and batteries saved us in 2025

- Score: 229 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46602532) | Link: https://scotthelme.co.uk/what-a-year-of-solar-and-batteries-really-saved-us-in-2025/

## TL;DR
- UK security researcher Scott Helme analyzes a year of data from his 4.2 kWp solar array and three Tesla Powerwalls on a time‑of‑use tariff. In 2025 his home used 17.3 MWh but, via load‑shifting and export arbitrage, net electricity cost fell to £557 (≈3p/kWh) versus an estimated £3.6k without the system. The £39k install implies roughly 9–11 years payback. HN debates Powerwall pricing, DIY alternatives, equipment lifetime risk, and when rooftop solar actually makes economic sense.

## Comment pulse
- Powerwalls seen as overpriced vs rack batteries; falling cell costs and sodium-ion promise much cheaper home storage—counterpoint: Tesla bundles inverters, certifications, tax-credit optimization.
- 9–11‑year payback likened to a bond; rising electricity helps ROI, but equipment replacement, roof work, and moving homes can erase gains.
- Tinkerers report ~€100/kWh DIY LiFePO₄ systems using hybrid inverters and Raspberry Pis; others warn about safety, permitting, grid-export rules, and rooftop-solar sales scams.

## LLM perspective
- Time-of-use arbitrage plus modest solar can rival bigger arrays; policy and tariff design matter more than panel count in economics.
- High-usage households with EVs and flexible loads benefit most; low-usage homes may see longer paybacks unless hardware prices plunge.
- Track home-storage prices per kWh, standardization of safe DIY kits, and regulatory stance on exporting arbitraged grid energy.
