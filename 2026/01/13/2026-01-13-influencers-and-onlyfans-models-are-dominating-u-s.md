# Influencers and OnlyFans models are dominating U.S. O-1 visa requests

- TL;DR  
  Influencers, OnlyFans creators and other online personalities are increasingly using the U.S. O‑1B “extraordinary ability” visa, traditionally associated with film, music and modeling. Lawyers now package follower counts, subscription income and viral reach as evidence of commercial success and national recognition. Examples include TikTok and Fanfix stars, a chess-streaming WGM, and a parody boy band crowdfunding legal fees. HN discussion wrestles with culture, morality and fairness: is this savvy adaptation of a cultural-talent visa or evidence of misplaced priorities?

- Comment pulse  
  - O‑1B already served actors, models, athletes; extending it to influencers/OnlyFans fits statute and uncapped numbers, so scientists aren’t being crowded out.  
  - Others argue not all “extraordinary ability” is equal: pro athletes inspire, explicit OnlyFans content and shallow influencer culture don’t match desired societal role models.  
  - Some see O‑1 as a politically safe economic-immigration backdoor: voters fear job competition from engineers, not niche entertainers, porn stars, or e‑sports streamers.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Influencer O‑1 cases show immigration law flexing to the creator economy while media hype (“dominating” claims) outpaces hard data.  
  - Impact: Immigration lawyers, platforms, and mid-tier creators gain; public debates culture, fairness, and what counts as “extraordinary” work.  
  - Watch next: USCIS guidance on digital-fame metrics, statistics on influencer approval rates, and pressure to expand skilled-worker visas beyond O‑1.
