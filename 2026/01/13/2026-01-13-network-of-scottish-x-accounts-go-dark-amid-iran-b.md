# Network of Scottish X accounts go dark amid Iran blackout

- Score: 298 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599574) | Link: https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25759181.network-scottish-x-accounts-go-dark-amid-iran-blackout/

## TL;DR
Iran-linked fake X (Twitter) accounts posing as Scottish pro-independence activists abruptly went silent when Iran experienced an internet blackout amid domestic protests. The accounts had been pushing fabricated stories of tanks in Edinburgh, BBC anchors detained, and uprisings across Scotland, trying to depict a UK in crisis. Prior investigations (Cyabra, Clemson University, UK Defence Journal) suggest a persistent, organized bot network amplifying pro-independence, left-leaning, and anti-Israel messaging. HN discussion focuses less on Scotland itself and more on how information warfare exploits real democratic debates.

## Comment pulse
- Foreign powers exploit Scottish independence discourse → weakening the UK aligns with Russian/Iranian interests; online sentiment is clearly unrepresentative of Scottish voting patterns. — counterpoint: some commenters stress Scottish agency and genuine support.
- Goal isn’t persuasion via wild claims → it’s to flood the infosphere, erode trust in any source, and make people give up on knowing what’s true.
- Analysts distinguish bots from real activists → concern is infiltration of authentic debates, not delegitimising independence; ultimate sponsors and operational details remain speculative.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat online political sentiment as an adversarial environment; sampling it as “public opinion” is increasingly unsafe without provenance checks.
- Impact: Small nations and regional movements are soft targets; their debates become convenient vectors for global rivalries and proxy info-operations.
- Watch next: Independent audits of major political hashtags, cross-platform bot attribution, and platform-level transparency on state-linked network takedowns.
