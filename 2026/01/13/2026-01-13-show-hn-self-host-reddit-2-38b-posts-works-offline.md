# Show HN: Self-host Reddit – 2.38B posts, works offline, yours forever

- Score: 193 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46602324) | Link: https://github.com/19-84/redd-archiver

- TL;DR  
  Redd-Archiver turns large Reddit, Voat, and Ruqqus dumps (including 2.38B+ Reddit posts from Pushshift) into self-hosted, browsable HTML archives. It supports pure-static offline viewing or Docker/PostgreSQL full‑text search, Tor deployment, and AI/REST access, plus tooling to prioritize at-risk communities and coordinate multiple public instances via a registry and leaderboard. HN discussion centers on restoring deleted Reddit comments, selectively mirroring only desired subreddits, keeping datasets fresh, and possibly using these archives to seed new decentralized social platforms.

- Comment pulse  
  - Call for tools that auto-restore deleted Reddit comments from archives → protest deletions intentionally reduce Reddit’s usefulness — counterpoint: users lose information they still need.  
  - Some dislike storing “all of Reddit” locally → maintainer notes Pushshift torrent is split by subreddits, so you can fetch only communities you care about.  
  - Questions on dataset freshness and new uses → Pushshift adds monthly dumps; registry/API enable coordinated, federated archives that could underlie new social systems.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treating Reddit as a static corpus shifts power from platform policies toward user-controlled preservation and analysis.  
  - Impact: Researchers, journalists, and communities gain stable URLs, reproducible datasets, and offline access independent of Reddit’s changing API or moderation.  
  - Watch next: tooling that layers live Reddit plus archival backfills, deduplicates updates, and exposes legal/ethical controls over sensitive data.
