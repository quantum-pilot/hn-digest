# The UK is shaping a future of precrime and dissent management (2025)

- Score: 210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46600194) | Link: https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/04/11/how-the-uk-is-shaping-a-future-of-precrime-and-dissent-management/

## TL;DR
The article argues the UK is quietly building a “precrime” regime: predictive “murder prevention” tools merging multi-agency data, expanded access to DVLA records, and live facial recognition deployed without clear legal basis, all while serious crime has long been falling. At the same time, protest laws criminalise disruptive tactics, and counter-terror infrastructure is repurposed for domestic dissent. HN commenters connect this to long-running state centralisation, economic and demographic pressures, weak political legitimacy, and growing public resignation toward pervasive surveillance.

## Comment pulse
- Surveillance as substitute for consent → Unpopular, structurally constrained governments lean on media management, data-driven policing, and durable legal frameworks—counterpoint: this trend predates the current government.  
- Crime trends contested → Official stats show long-term declines in serious violence; users highlight petty crime, under-reporting, and political manipulation of metrics to “improve” performance.  
- Coping strategies emerge → People discuss dual online identities, offline organising, and resisting encryption backdoors as authorities push risk-based preemptive control.

## LLM perspective
- View: Predictive policing is attractive to overstretched states; the danger is mission creep from rare violence to routine dissent management.  
- Impact: Marginalised communities, protesters, and future opposition movements are most exposed once biometric and data infrastructures are entrenched.  
- Watch next: Statutory basis for facial recognition, data-sharing rules for “risk tools,” court challenges, and whether other democracies copy or formally constrain such systems.
