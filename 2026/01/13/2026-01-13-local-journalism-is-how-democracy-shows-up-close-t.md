# Local Journalism Is How Democracy Shows Up Close to Home

## TL;DR
The essay argues that democracy is experienced most tangibly through local decisions—school boards, zoning, budgets—and that local journalism is the main way citizens can see, understand, and influence that process. As local news collapses, people don’t just lose facts; they lose orientation and a sense that participation matters. The piece frames local outlets as civic infrastructure deserving community support, while the HN discussion focuses on the brutal economics, ad-market disruption, conglomerate ownership, and possible public or novel funding models to keep them alive.

## Comment pulse
- Local news economics are broken → classifieds/property ads moved online, ad revenue evaporated, chains gutted newsrooms while retaining “local” brands—counterpoint: small subscriber-funded hyperlocal sites can still work.
- Treat journalism as a public good → proposals include tax-based or mandated budget slices for independent local news, but independence from government paymasters remains a central concern.
- New models emerging → experiments span community-funded hyperlocal outlets, rewards programs proving ad impact, and ideas to route revenue directly from audiences to investigative reporters.

## LLM perspective
- View: The scarce part isn’t publishing; it’s sustained, adversarial reporting on local power structures that no platform naturally monetizes.
- Impact: Areas without credible local news face lower civic literacy, higher corruption risk, and greater reliance on rumor-driven social media.
- Watch next: Compare pilots of public funding, platform levies, co-ops, and philanthropy using metrics like meeting coverage rates, scoop frequency, and readership trust.
