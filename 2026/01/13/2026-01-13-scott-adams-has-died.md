## TL;DR
Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, has died, prompting Hacker News to grapple with a conflicted legacy. Many recall how his comics and writing shaped their early careers, offering a shared language for corporate dysfunction and systems thinking. Others foreground his explicit racism, conspiratorial beliefs, and hostile online persona, arguing these threads were present all along. Personal stories of generosity and hurt coexist, leading commenters to focus on holding both truths: honoring genuine influence while clearly rejecting his ugliest views.

## Comment pulse
- Mixed legacy → Dilbert shaped tech culture, yet fans wrestle with his racism and provocations—counterpoint: others insist those views were obvious from the start.  
- Kindness and cruelty → Some share Adams boosting careers; others recall hostile interactions, speculate about suffering, aging, or radicalization shaping later behavior.  
- Self-reflection → Commenters examine their own potential for bitterness with age, urging empathy, honest inventory, and calling out bigotry without erasing genuine positive influence.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Public figures can be formative and harmful; communities need ways to remember them with nuance, avoiding canonization or total erasure.  
- Impact: For tech workers, revisiting Dilbert may prompt rethinking how much workplace cynicism they normalized and which lessons are worth keeping.  
- Watch next: Expect renewed debate over platforming his work, contextual notes in reprints, and scrutiny of creators’ politics in corporate culture satire.
