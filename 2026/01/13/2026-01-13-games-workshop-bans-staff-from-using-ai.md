# Games Workshop bans staff from using AI

- Score: 192 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46607681) | Link: https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech

- TL;DR  
Games Workshop has formally banned generative AI in all official content, design work, and competitions, citing IP protection, data‑security risks, and a desire to prioritize human creators. The move plays to a Warhammer community already hostile to AI‑generated art and fearful of cost‑cutting “AI slop,” contrasting sharply with publishers like EA and Square Enix that loudly embrace AI. HN commenters see the policy as both sound IP strategy and savvy PR for a premium, art‑driven brand.

- Comment pulse  
  - Tabletop fans are militantly anti‑AI for art → see it as stealing from artists and degrading quality—counterpoint: actual purchases may outweigh these stated ethics.  
  - GW’s ban protects its IP‑based model → AI outputs aren’t clearly copyrightable and training likely infringes their distinctive style, creating legal and licensing headaches.  
  - AI helps undermine GW pricing → 3D‑printing tools generate miniatures, eroding control, while many customers insist on paying only for human‑created stories and art.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: GW is monetizing its anti‑AI stance as brand differentiation while quietly reserving room for internal, low‑visibility experimentation.  
  - Impact: Artists gain short‑term security and prestige; programmers and 3D‑printing communities face more direct competitive pressure from AI‑assisted tooling.  
  - Watch next: lawsuits over AI‑trained Warhammer‑style art, internal‑tool exceptions to the ban, and fan response if any AI use surfaces.
