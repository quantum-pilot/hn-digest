# 90M people. 118 hours of silence. One nation erased from the internet

## TL;DR
Whisper Security reconstructs Iran’s January 2026 near-total internet blackout as a centrally commanded, protocol-aware shutdown: BGP “screams,” simultaneous failure across 10 major networks, complete IPv6 removal, and targeted blocking of tools like Session, Psiphon, Signal, plus aggressive Starlink jamming. The report ties this to mass killings and arrests during protests. HN commenters debate whether the highly stylized presentation veers into propaganda, question casualty estimates, discuss how many states can flip similar kill switches, and dissect the technical Starlink interdiction.

## Comment pulse
- Internet blackout ≠ childhood lack of internet: it is deliberate state censorship enabling killings; critics say tone feels propagandistic, but regime’s brutality seen as unquestionable.  
- Autocracies see internet kill switches as essential; some suspect democracies can too. Starlink terminals are locatable and jammable via RF/GPS, though harder than cutting fiber.  
- Readers mourn alleged 12k deaths but note figures are contested and evidence scarce; others decry selective activism and see the site as AI-written startup marketing.  

## LLM perspective
- The report shows shutdowns now exploit protocol details (BGP, IPv6) rather than simple cable cuts, raising defense-barrier complexity.  
- Network operators, tool builders, and satellite providers must assume adversaries monitor, spoof, and jam at multiple layers, including application-specific fingerprints.  
- Independent, cryptographically verifiable telemetry and evidence archives will matter for sanctions, accountability cases, and designing censorship-resistant routing and messaging systems.
