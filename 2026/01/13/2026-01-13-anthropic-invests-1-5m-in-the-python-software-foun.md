# Anthropic invests $1.5M in the Python Software Foundation

- Score: 353 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46601902) | Link: https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694

## TL;DR
Anthropic is donating $1.5M over two years to the Python Software Foundation, earmarked primarily for security: strengthening PyPI against supply-chain attacks, building proactive malware-scanning tools and datasets, and funding core PSF work like CPython development and infrastructure. HN welcomes investment in a critical but underfunded ecosystem, especially given AI’s dependence on Python, yet debates whether the amount is small relative to Anthropic’s scale and partially marketing-driven. Others argue that even “peanuts” meaningfully move the needle for a lean PSF.

## Comment pulse
- Donation is well-targeted → Python underpins AI; PyPI is a prime supply-chain attack surface, so security-focused funding protects millions of downstream users and companies.  
- Amount feels small → relative to Anthropic’s valuation and Python’s value, $1.5M looks like cheap PR — counterpoint: for PSF, it’s transformative money.  
- Motives mixed but acceptable → likely blend of ecosystem stewardship, enlightened self-interest, and marketing; many argue this is exactly how corporate open-source funding should work.

## LLM perspective
- View: This formalizes AI labs as direct infrastructure funders, not just consumers, of foundational languages and package ecosystems.  
- Impact: PSF can hire, ship tooling, and harden PyPI in ways impossible under a purely volunteer, grant-scraping model.  
- Watch next: Concrete PyPI security tooling, transparency reports on malware detection, and whether other AI firms match or exceed this funding level.
