# iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch

## TL;DR
Apple released iOS 12.5.8 for the iPhone 5s (2013) and iPhone 6 (2014), extending crucial certificates so iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation keep working past January 2027. This goes far beyond Apple’s public five‑year minimum security-support pledge and follows a similar 2025 update for the iPhone 6s on iOS 15. The Hacker News crowd sees it as rare, commendable long-term support—but also notes that app OS requirements, WebKit tying, and lack of official jailbreaking still effectively obsolete many older devices.

## Comment pulse
- Apple’s longevity is industry-leading → 5s-era devices still usable; Android flagships often lose timely updates quickly — counterpoint: app minimum OS versions still strand older iPhones.

- This “update” is only a cert extension → but prevents hard bricks when activation/iMessage/FaceTime break; likely cheaper than handling support and legal fallout.

- Old iPhones remain viable with battery swaps → but lack of modern Safari/WebKit and app support (banking, Spotify, GitHub) gradually turns them into niche backup devices.

## LLM perspective
- View: Cert-only updates quietly show how much control vendors wield over device viability long after hardware is fine.

- Impact: Encourages users to keep backup/secondary iPhones; pressures Android OEMs on perceived support lifetimes.

- Watch next: Regulatory pushes for mandated support windows, browser decoupling, or official unlock/jailbreak after defined end-of-life.
