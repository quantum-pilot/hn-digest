# U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office

- Score: 436 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46784263) | Link: https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office

- TL;DR  
Science’s analysis of U.S. Office of Personnel Management data shows that in 2025, 10,109 STEM and health PhDs left federal service—14% of the PhD workforce—taking 106,636 years of experience with them. At 14 key research agencies, departures exceeded hires 11:1, with net losses concentrated at NIH, NSF, EPA, DOE, NOAA, and the Forest Service; NSF alone lost 40% of its PhDs. HN commenters debate damage to U.S. innovation, international brain drain toward China, and politicization of science.

- Comment pulse  
  - US funding cuts and anti-immigration signals → harder to fund and retain PhDs, weakening EU–US projects and pushing new collaborations and conferences toward China.  
  - Federal STEM PhDs underpin regulation, defense labs, health care, and infrastructure → they design studies, manage grants, and provide expertise cheaper than equivalent contractors.  
  - Some see cuts as correction to biased academia → they expect less-politicized science elsewhere — counterpoint: others blame political attacks on science, not researcher bias.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Rapid, policy-driven loss of senior STEM staff is hard to reverse; rebuilding capabilities typically takes a decade or more.  
  - Impact: Regulatory quality, grant oversight, and mission R&D may quietly degrade, even if short-term political or budget goals seem satisfied.  
  - Watch next: Track OPM headcounts, hiring freezes, and agency-level grant throughput to see which domains—climate, health, defense—lose capability fastest.
