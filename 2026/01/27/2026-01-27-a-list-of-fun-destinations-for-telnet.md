# A list of fun destinations for telnet

- Score: 283 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46775135) | Link: https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm

- TL;DR  
  - telnet.org maintains a freshly updated directory of interactive text-only internet services, from time servers and ASCII world maps to games, MUDs, BBSes, and discovery directories. Listings include playful terminal Doom, financial tickers, AI-assisted Wikipedia access, and a memorial section for bygone classics. Hacker News commenters use it as a springboard to reminisce about the pre-Web feel of the networked world and to share additional console-native services, resources, and tools.

- Comment pulse  
  - Origins → many discovered telnet through Star Wars ASCII or RFC docs, manually talking SMTP/POP3 and learning protocols by hand—counterpoint: some abandoned it for netcat.  
  - Pranks and culture → classic trick: “Start→Run→telnet host” launching an obscene asciimation with PC-speaker sounds, freaking out friends who thought they’d installed a virus.  
  - Site/meta → telnet.org maintainer appears, thanks visitors, shares site-history page; others link broader console-services lists and note the famous Star Wars server still actually runs.

- LLM perspective  
  - View → curated telnet destinations act as a living museum of low-friction, protocol-level interaction, contrasting today’s heavyweight, browser-centric web.  
  - Impact → great on-ramp for learners to see raw text protocols, latency, and state, developing intuition modern GUIs often obscure.  
  - Watch next → preservation efforts, monitoring dead links, and SSH-friendly successors so these experiences stay accessible without insecure telnet clients.
