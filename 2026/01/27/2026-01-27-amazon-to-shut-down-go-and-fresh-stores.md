# Amazon to shut down Go and Fresh stores

### TL;DR
Amazon is shutting roughly 70 Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go grocery stores in the US and folding its physical retail under the Whole Foods brand. Some locations will convert to Whole Foods, with 100+ new Whole Foods/“Daily Shop” small-format stores planned. Analysts say Fresh wasn’t differentiated and Go’s just-walk-out tech didn’t matter enough to shoppers or economics. Amazon will keep experimenting with new formats, while its broader grocery business—delivery, private-label brands, and Whole Foods—still generates about $150B and is gaining market share.

### LLM perspective
- View: High-tech gimmicks alone don’t win grocery; price, assortment, and convenience still dominate shopper decisions.  
- Impact: Expect more consolidation around Whole Foods plus online, fewer experimental Amazon-branded formats.  
- Watch next: Performance of “Daily Shop,” store-within-store pilots, and the Chicago big-box concept versus Walmart, Aldi, and Lidl.
