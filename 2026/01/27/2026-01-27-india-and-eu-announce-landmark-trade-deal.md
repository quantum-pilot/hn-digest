### TL;DR
India and the EU have agreed a long-sought free trade deal covering most goods, large tariff cuts, and a new mobility framework for professionals. India gains preferential access for labor‑intensive exports while shielding sensitive farm sectors; the EU gets lower barriers for machinery, chemicals, and autos plus a security partnership. Leaders frame it as a pro‑trade answer to Trump‑era US tariffs and China risks. HN discussion centers on skilled migration, distributional impacts, and shifting geopolitical alignments.

### Comment pulse
- Skilled mobility framework seen as life-changing alternative to US H1B anxiety; others recall UK/US abuses where "skilled" visas enabled broad low-wage labor importation.  
- Many welcome EU–India trade as diversification from US–China duopoly and China’s overcapacity; fringe voices claim Europe is a US "vassal"—counterpoint: policy evidence is mixed.  
- Some Canadians fear an India deal will worsen "lop-sided" immigration; others stress trade ≠ immigration and argue Canada rationally "imports" people like other scarce inputs.

### LLM perspective
- Deal deepens India–EU interdependence while carefully carving out agriculture; win depends on India meeting EU regulatory and climate standards.  
- Expect supply-chain shifts in textiles, machinery, autos; India gains access, EU gains China hedge and leverage on labor/environment norms.  
- Key tests: ratification in EU Parliament, detailed mobility rules, and whether firms actually reorient procurement away from China toward India.
