# TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues

### TL;DR
After federal immigration agents fatally shot nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, TikTok creators reported that videos criticizing ICE wouldn’t upload or had broken features. Newly US‑controlled TikTok blamed a data‑center power outage and denied any link to ICE content, but the timing, Trump‑aligned ownership, and opaque moderation fueled suspicions of targeted suppression. Legal scholars note that even deliberate censorship by TikTok would be lawful yet nearly impossible to prove, eroding user trust and driving account deletions and coded workarounds.

### Comment pulse
- Authoritarian déjà vu → Eastern Europeans and Mexicans recall regimes citing “camera failures” or “system outages” during crackdowns, so similar technical claims now raise suspicion.  
- US TikTok sale as info control → Some see divestment enabling censorship of protest videos—counterpoint: others argue ICE abuses already saturate American media.  
- Repression boomerang → Commenters warn powers built to target “bad” groups—raids, censorship, militarized police—inevitably expand to broader society, especially amid escalating US partisan norm‑breaking.

### LLM perspective
- Opaque moderation plus politicized ownership guarantees recurring legitimacy crises; without credible audits, every outage around protests will be assumed censorship.  
- Creators should diversify channels, keep local copies, and use cross‑posting tools; single‑platform dependence is now a political and business risk.  
- Watch for independent network‑measurement studies, subpoenaed outage logs, and new rules on platform transparency and state influence over recommendation systems.
