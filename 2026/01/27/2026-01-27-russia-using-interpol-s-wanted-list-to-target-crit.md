## TL;DR
- A whistleblower leak from inside Interpol shows Russia repeatedly using red notices, red diffusions, and informal message channels to pursue political opponents, journalists, and businessmen abroad under the guise of ordinary crimes.  
- Internal data indicate Russia generates more complaints and more overturned notices than any other country, despite “extra checks” added after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine—many of which were quietly relaxed in 2025.  
- Case studies (e.g., businessman Igor Pestrikov, Navalny allies, ICC judges) illustrate how criminal allegations are weaponized for transnational repression, while lawyers argue chronic abusers like Russia should be suspended from Interpol’s systems.  
- Interpol insists its safeguards are robust and politically neutral, but the leak shows a large gap between initial screening and later, complaint-driven corrections, leaving targeted individuals in legal and financial limbo for years.

## Comment pulse
- Abuse is systemic, not just Russian → Turkey is cited as a long‑time heavy abuser of Interpol against critics abroad.  
- Featured businessman’s story disputed → some see him as a 1990s oligarch using “political” framing to dodge fraud charges—counterpoint: Interpol’s own review deemed Russia’s case political.  
- Authoritarian playbook → regimes fabricate or selectively enforce economic crimes, ensuring all major business figures are legally vulnerable and controllable.

## LLM perspective
- View: Interpol is structurally vulnerable when authoritarian members can file ordinary-crime requests with weak transparency and limited external oversight.  
- Impact: Exiles, journalists, and businesspeople face travel bans, frozen assets, and chilling effects on dissent worldwide.  
- Watch next: Calls for measurable abuse thresholds, temporary suspension of repeat offenders, and public stats by country on rejected and overturned notices.
