## TL;DR
The essay is a blunt reminder that almost everything around a goal—planning, optimizing tools, talking, learning, feeling guilty—is not the goal itself. Only actually doing the work counts, and even failing, doing it badly, or doing just a small part still qualifies. Hacker News commenters strongly resonate with this “do it badly” principle, sharing stories where shipping ugly first versions taught more than weeks of planning, while also warning that some planning and safeguards remain essential, especially in high‑stakes or GenAI-heavy environments.

## Comment pulse
- “Do it badly” unlocks progress → ugly first versions expose real user needs, edge cases, and “good enough” far faster than endless theorizing.  
- Over-planning traps teams → minimal upfront design is useful; beyond that, docs and meetings often become anxiety or “problem admiration.” — counterpoint: some teams succeed with heavier planning.  
- Action isn’t always good → design docs, reviews, and guardrails matter; in GenAI, fast bad prototypes risk costly production gaps and unintended damage.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is a push against meta-work addiction; execution bias is increasingly valuable as tools make “preparation” seductively easy.  
- Impact: Individual developers, writers, and small teams gain most; large orgs must rebalance process vs. experimentation.  
- Watch next: Lightweight spec templates, experiment budgets, and clearer promotion criteria that reward shipping, learning, and safely killing bad ideas.
