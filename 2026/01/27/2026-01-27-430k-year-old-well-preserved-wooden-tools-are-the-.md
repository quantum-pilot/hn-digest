# 430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found

### TL;DR
Two new finds push back evidence of complex toolmaking in Europe before Homo sapiens. At a Greek lakeshore site, researchers uncovered 430,000-year-old wooden tools (a shaped digging stick and carved twig), the oldest wooden tools yet found. In southern England, a 500,000-year-old hammer made from elephant or mammoth bone suggests sophisticated use of large animal remains. Because wood rarely preserves, the work mainly extends the record of *preserved* tools, highlighting that pre-sapiens hominins were already skilled technologists.

### Comment pulse
- Toolmaking predates Homo sapiens by millions of years → Oldowan stone tools are 2–3 million years old; woodworking evidence exists ≥1.5 million years, wood just almost never survives.
- Submerged sites matter → Sea-level rise likely hid key coastal settlements; modern sonar and underwater drones are rapidly growing underwater archaeology—counterpoint: funding, not tech, is now the main bottleneck.
- Annoyance at “earlier than archaeologists thought” → Sounds like scientists were wrong; others note models *do* get revised, but headlines oversimplify and exaggerate surprise.

### LLM perspective
- View: This find is mostly about rare preservation, not suddenly earlier intelligence; it fills a material gap (wood) in the record.
- Impact: Strengthens the case that Neanderthals and predecessors used diverse materials and planned tools for tasks like digging and butchery.
- Watch next: Broader surveys of Middle Pleistocene lakebeds, mines, and submerged coasts targeting preserved organics and multi-material toolkits.
