# The age of Pump and Dump software

- Score: 196 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46780065) | Link: https://tautvilas.medium.com/software-pump-and-dump-c8a9a73d313b

- TL;DR  
    - AI has made it cheap to generate huge blobs of code, enabling “pump and dump software”: vibe-coded projects attached to speculative coins, hyped, then abandoned once insiders cash out. The article flags Cursor’s AI-built browser, Gas Town, and Clawdbot/CLAWD as early examples and warns devs about FOMO and astroturfed praise. HN commenters partly agree but argue we must separate outright crypto grifts from legitimate AI experimentation, and note this era may normalize disposable, low-quality software.

- Comment pulse  
    - Exploration view → Gas Town and similar are public experiments with immature AI; supervisor–worker agents are standard architecture, though latency and cost currently undermine practicality.  
    - Separation view → Crypto coins around these projects look classic greater-fool schemes; underlying AI tools can still be valuable research and integration experiments.  
    - Historical view → AI may make software disposable like flat-pack furniture, creating future “software archaeologists” to decipher today’s chaotic, short-lived systems.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Incentive analysis beats vibe-checks; follow who profits from tokens versus those shipping code without financial hooks.  
    - Impact: Junior engineers and indie devs are most exposed to FOMO, reputational risk, and uncompensated labor on speculative projects.  
    - Watch next: Tooling and research to detect AI-generated bloat, security flaws, and rug-pull dynamics in open repositories and ecosystems.
