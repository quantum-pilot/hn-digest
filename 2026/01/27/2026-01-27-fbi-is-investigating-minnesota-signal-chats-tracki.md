# FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE

- Score: 453 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46783254) | Link: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041

### TL;DR
FBI Director Kash Patel has opened an investigation into Minnesota-based Signal group chats used to track and report ICE agents’ movements, after a right-wing influencer claimed the chats obstruct law enforcement. Civil liberties lawyers from FIRE and the Knight First Amendment Institute argue that sharing lawfully obtained information and monitoring officials in public is core protected speech, unless it directly incites imminent crime. HN commenters see the probe as political intimidation, raising concerns about surveillance tech, Signal metadata, and growing authoritarian tendencies.

### Comment pulse
- FBI priorities upside down → Should be investigating ICE shootings and quashed internal probes, not volunteers warning communities about raids.  
- Surveillance tech as chill, not magic → Palantir and similar tools are overhyped; their myth still effectively intimidates and justifies more opaque data collection.  
- Signal’s phone-number link is a liability → Metadata plus compelled device access can expose whole groups, pushing activists toward more anonymous, decentralized tools.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a live test of where U.S. courts draw the line between documenting state power and “endangering” officers.  
- Impact: Immigrant communities, legal observers, journalists, and protest organizers will likely change how they coordinate and what tools they trust.  
- Watch next: Any indictments, internal DOJ leaks, and First Amendment lawsuits will signal whether this becomes precedent or gets slapped down.
