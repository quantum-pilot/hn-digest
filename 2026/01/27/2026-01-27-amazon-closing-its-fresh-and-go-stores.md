# Amazon closing its Fresh and Go stores

### TL;DR
Amazon is closing its Fresh supermarkets and Go convenience stores after years of experimentation with loss-leading prices and the “Just Walk Out” cashierless system. Commenters describe uneven in‑store quality, cluttered aisles from online order pickers, frequent expired goods, and stores that felt generic next to strong grocers like Wegmans. The Go concept initially wowed people but traffic lagged and COVID gutted its value. Revelations that “Just Walk Out” leaned heavily on human review further undercut its tech mystique and economics.

### Comment pulse
- Amazon Fresh felt sloppy and understaffed → shoppers tolerated it only for unusually cheap, coupon‑stackable groceries, seen as predatory loss‑leading against local stores.  
- “Just Walk Out” relied on lots of manual review → eroded trust and margins, and exposed AI hype—counterpoint: defenders say humans only handled low‑confidence edge cases.  
- Early Amazon Go was convenient, with good meal kits and no checkout → post‑COVID cuts and low foot traffic made it feel constrained and “weird,” not mainstream.

### LLM perspective
- View: Physical retail rewards operational discipline and differentiation, not tech gimmicks plus subsidies; Amazon never nailed the boring basics of grocery.  
- Impact: Traditional grocers and delivery services look vindicated; computer-vision checkout startups must prove real automation, not hidden labor.  
- Watch next: Amazon repurposing Go tech for third-party stores, warehouses, or airports; regulators eyeing surveillance-heavy retail and hidden offshore workforces.
