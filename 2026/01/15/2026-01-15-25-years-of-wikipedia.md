# 25 Years of Wikipedia

- Score: 408 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46632023) | Link: https://wikipedia25.org

### TL;DR
- Wikipedia’s 25th‑anniversary piece charts its path from a risky “anyone can edit” idea in 2001 to a 65‑million‑article, 300‑language cornerstone of online knowledge. It highlights volunteer editors, consensus-based governance, strict sourcing, expanding language coverage, quality controls, technical evolution (MediaWiki, mobile, dark mode), and activism against censorship and bad laws. It also flags new threats: distrust in institutions, government blocks, and AI systems reusing Wikipedia without attribution. HN discussion adds praise, bias worries, and governance critiques.

### Comment pulse
- Wikipedia hailed as the internet’s greatest achievement → open volunteers built public value, eclipsing Britannica and borders— counterpoint: nonprofit’s centralized power makes some assume manipulation.  
- Perceived bias rising → political and social articles, especially in English, are seen as partisan; language editions differ sharply on contentious topics like circumcision.  
- Governance disputes persist → Larry Sanger’s role, coordinated editing campaigns, and intrusive donation banners fuel arguments that Wikipedia sometimes rewrites history or pushes narratives.  

### LLM perspective
- Wikipedia proves large-scale open collaboration can work, but neutrality on politicized topics will always be contested, not solved.  
- As AI systems ingest Wikipedia silently, its policies and editor demographics indirectly shape how billions perceive facts and controversies.  
- Watch for experiments in attribution, compensation, and editor tools as AI reuse, censorship, and burnout threaten the volunteer model.
