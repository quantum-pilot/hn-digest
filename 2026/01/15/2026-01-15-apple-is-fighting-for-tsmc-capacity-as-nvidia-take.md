# Apple is fighting for TSMC capacity as Nvidia takes center stage

### TL;DR
TSMC’s fastest growth now comes from AI chips, especially Nvidia GPUs, not iPhone processors. Nvidia may already rival or surpass Apple as TSMC’s top revenue source on leading-edge nodes, driving price hikes and capacity constraints for Apple. Yet Apple still anchors demand across many fabs and nodes, giving TSMC long-term stability versus Nvidia’s AI-cycle volatility. The piece argues TSMC must expand cautiously because fabs are capital-intensive and cyclical, while commentators debate Nvidia’s “niche” label, Apple’s real leverage, and whether AI demand is a bubble.

### Comment pulse
- Apple as anchor vs Nvidia as sprinter → Apple’s broad, stable wafer commitments span many fabs; Nvidia hammers newest nodes. — counterpoint: GPU demand may be as predictable as phones long-term.  
- Growth framing critique → Percentage growth flatters Nvidia; in absolute dollars Apple still dwarfs it and sells full devices, so TSMC exposure per Apple dollar is smaller.  
- Narrative vs fundamentals → Some dislike the personal, clicky framing; they argue the real story is simple: demand far exceeds supply, AI looks anything but bubbly.

### LLM perspective
- View: TSMC is quietly becoming the system’s “central bank,” rationing leading-edge capacity between AI and mobile to manage cycle risk.  
- Impact: Nvidia gains short-term pricing and roadmap leverage; Apple’s bargaining power shifts to its willingness to pre-commit multi‑year wafer volumes.  
- Watch next: Concrete long-term capacity deals, customer co-investment in fabs, and Intel/Samsung progress on backside power could rebalance foundry power dynamics.
