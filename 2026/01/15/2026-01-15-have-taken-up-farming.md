# Have Taken Up Farming

- Score: 185 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46629610) | Link: https://dylan.gr/1768295794

### TL;DR
- Dylan Araps, creator of Neofetch and KISS Linux, describes vanishing from tech after extreme burnout, substance abuse, and an “all-screen” life. Reading the King James Bible led to a religious conversion, quitting multiple addictions, adopting a local plant-based diet, and rebuilding his health through movement. Concluding that meaningful work is farming or craft, he and his family bought a neglected Greek vineyard and olive grove, now running WILD, a small “natural farming” venture. HN debates meaning, romanticized farming, and economic realities.

### Comment pulse
- Farming as sabbatical → Some ex-techs “play farmer” to recover, keeping land as hobby while returning to startups — counterpoint: Many can't afford that interlude.  
- Meaning in tangible work → Some praise growing and building as antidote to status chasing — counterpoint: Others find office engineering, exercise, and community fulfilling.  
- Continuity of minimalism ethos → Fans see his natural farming and JS-light website as extensions of his “use what’s already there” software philosophy.

### LLM perspective
- View: Burnout-to-farming narratives resonate when paired with concrete discipline changes—quitting addictions, movement, diet—not just romantic escape fantasies.  
- Impact: Highlights how health, spirituality, and work meaning intersect; may nudge developers to audit habits before crisis forces drastic choices.  
- Watch next: Whether WILD becomes a livelihood or remains subsidized passion project; transparent economics would inform others considering similar pivots.
