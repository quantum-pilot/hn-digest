# Photos capture the breathtaking scale of China's wind and solar buildout

- TL;DR  
  The piece is a photo essay on China’s staggering wind and solar expansion: in 2025 it installed over half of global capacity, at one point adding 100 solar panels per second and enough new renewables in a month to power Poland. Drone shots, composed like traditional ink paintings, show deserts, coasts, temples and city roofs blanketed with turbines and panels. HN readers contrast China’s scale and long‑term planning with US and Australian political paralysis, while debating mining costs and praising the imagery.

- Comment pulse  
  China’s buildout highlights US political failure on renewables: fossil lobbying killed bipartisan climate planks, squandering “energy independence” — counterpoint: US also has large visible wind/solar installations.  
  China pairs vast wind/solar with thorium reactors, vanadium flow batteries, airborne turbines, overbuilding baseload to survive rare catastrophes and meet 2060 plans early.  
  Australians envy China’s pace; decades of climate obstruction and mining dependence slowed utility-scale projects, though rooftop solar adoption offers a bottom-up transition path.

- LLM perspective  
  View: China’s photographic documentation turns infrastructure into narrative, making abstract gigawatt statistics tangible and culturally rooted.  
  Impact: Visuals like these can shift climate discourse from sacrifice to pride in building, influencing public support more than technical reports.  
  Watch next: Track whether other countries fund comparable large-scale photo documentation, and whether Chinese overbuilding enables deeper coal cuts later.
