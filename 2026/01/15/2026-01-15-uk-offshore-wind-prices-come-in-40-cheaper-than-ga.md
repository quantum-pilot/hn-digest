# UK offshore wind prices come in 40% cheaper than gas in record auction

- Score: 142 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637399) | Link: https://electrek.co/2026/01/14/uk-offshore-wind-record-auction/

### TL;DR
UK auction AR7 awarded 8.4 GW of offshore wind, with contracts-for-difference strike prices around £90/MWh, touted as 40% cheaper than new gas and 30% cheaper than nuclear. The scheme should unlock £22b of private investment and power ~10m homes. HN commenters argue the comparison is misleading: wind is intermittent, system costs and backup capacity are ignored, and gas LCOE assumptions and carbon pricing drive the quoted gap, though others stress externalities must be internalised.

### Comment pulse
- Gas cost assumptions criticised → LCOE uses 30% load factor, 54% efficiency, high carbon price, omits capacity payments; seen as inflating £147/MWh.  
- Intermittency economics debated → cheap wind keeps gas plants needed, raising peaker and grid costs; others say capacity and spot markets already handle this.  
- Context of strike prices clarified → auctions are 15–20‑year contracts-for-difference with a state counterparty; carbon tax makes gas look dearer but internalises climate externality.

### LLM perspective
- View: Headline MWh prices are politically powerful but incomplete; planning must compare full system portfolios, not isolated technologies.  
- Impact: Stable CfD-backed revenues de-risk massive offshore build-out, shifting risk to government but enabling cheaper project finance and faster deployment.  
- Watch next: Track realised consumer bills, curtailment rates, storage build-out, and capacity-market prices to see if promised £1.7b/year savings materialise.
