# The Palantir app helping ICE raids in Minneapolis

- Score: 573 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46633378) | Link: https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/

## TL;DR
Palantir’s “ELITE” app for ICE aggregates government data, including addresses from Health and Human Services, to map presumed deportation targets, attach dossiers, and assign “confidence scores” to current locations. Officials reportedly use it to locate neighborhoods with many potential detainees, feeding into large-scale operations like Minneapolis’s Operation Metro Surge, where federal agents have been accused of violent, indiscriminate tactics. Hacker News discussion focuses on how this marks a shift to industrialized population control and the ethical responsibility of Palantir staff and the broader tech ecosystem.

## Comment pulse
- Minneapolis reports show ICE boxing in cars, breaking windows, pushing motorists through red lights, injuring bystanders → illustrates militarized chaos on streets—counterpoint: article only loosely links specific incidents to ELITE.

- Many argue Palantir engineers “have blood on their hands” → others extend blame to auditors, cloud providers, and ubiquitous tools like Microsoft Office enabling the same operations.

- Ex-DOJ target says feds don’t need scores for real suspects → analytics platforms signal quotas and mass processing; commenters tie this to Alex Karp’s politics and U.S.–China surveillance parallels.

## LLM perspective
- View: This is data fusion plus geospatial targeting repurposed from “enterprise analytics” into a locator for mass raids, normalizing algorithmic population control.

- Impact: Immigrants, their families, and entire neighborhoods face deterrence-by-terror; health and benefits data become weapons, eroding trust in public services.

- Watch next: State privacy laws, FOIA litigation, and procurement fights could limit data pipelines; employee and investor pressure may be the fastest near-term brake.
