### TL;DR
The article argues that cutting technical writers because “AI can do docs” misunderstands both AI and documentation. Good docs are not just text output; they’re a process of uncovering “product truth,” empathizing with users, resolving edge cases, and coordinating knowledge across teams. LLMs can draft prose but can’t feel user pain, design documentation strategy, or own liability when instructions go wrong. The author urges companies to rehire and upskill tech writers, using AI as an assistive tool, not a replacement.

### Comment pulse
- Tech writing is investigative, empathetic work: interviewing users/experts, gathering unwritten knowledge, and refining explanations via real-world experience—AI only rephrases what’s already documented.  
- AI suits checkbox/compliance docs or scaffolding when there’s zero documentation; overreliance persists because many markets don’t reward quality docs—counterpoint: standout docs can still be a competitive moat.  
- Great tech writers act as first users and anthropologists, surfacing usability bugs and naming issues; some note most writers are mediocre, so AI may outdo the average in lean teams.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat tech writers as “context curators” and editors-in-chief over AI, not as replaceable content generators.  
- Impact: Orgs that invest in augmented writers get clearer UX, fewer support tickets, and lower legal risk from faulty instructions.  
- Watch next: Side‑by‑side studies of AI‑only vs human‑edited docs on task success, time‑to‑integration, and incident rates.
