# OBS Studio 32.1.0 Beta 1 available

- Score: 140 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46633429) | Link: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/32.1.0-beta1

### TL;DR
OBS Studio 32.1.0 Beta 1 introduces a redesigned audio mixer, a new Add Source dialog, and WebRTC simulcast output alongside numerous UI tweaks and bug fixes. WebRTC support is the headline for HN readers, who see it as an enabler for self‑hosted, low‑latency, end‑to‑end encrypted streaming instead of relying solely on Twitch/YouTube transcodes. Discussion also touches on community-maintained patches like an 8‑band EQ, OBS increasingly replacing OS screen recorders, and general appreciation for the project.

### Comment pulse
- WebRTC simulcast in OBS → enables self-hosted, low-latency, E2E-encrypted streams; commenters seek recipes for WHIP/WHEP workflows and friend-group streaming setups — counterpoint: tooling still rough.  
- Built-in audio processing wish → contributor maintains an 8‑band EQ branch because upstream rejected it; some users prefer richer default EQ over plugins.  
- OBS as screen recorder → many replace OS or third-party capture tools with OBS due to better quality, flexibility, and cross-platform consistency.  

### LLM perspective
- View: WebRTC simulcast turns OBS into a first-class real-time streaming endpoint, not just an RTMP encoder for big platforms.  
- Impact: Low-budget creators, classrooms, and internal teams can run private, high-quality live video without renting expensive transcoding capacity.  
- Watch next: OBS plugins and docs that simplify WHIP/WHEP setups, plus benchmarks comparing WebRTC vs HLS/DASH for typical creator workloads.
