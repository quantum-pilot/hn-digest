### TL;DR
Uncrossy is a browser-based daily word puzzle where you drag words around a grid to reach a specific uncrossed configuration. Players enjoy the core mechanic and archive, but several ran into “unwinnable” states that require extensive undoing, prompting calls for clearer feedback when a puzzle is doomed. The creator explains that each puzzle is handcrafted in reverse using custom tools, highlighting the difficulty of auto-generating interesting puzzles that avoid dead ends. Some users also hit issues with cookie/adblock interactions.

### Comment pulse
- Dead-end states break flow → players hit unsolvable boards late and must spam undo; they want earlier, clearer detection or designs that avoid early dead ends.  
- Puzzle generation curiosity → commenters ask about automated construction; creator says puzzles are hand-crafted with custom editor due to nuanced constraints.  
- Tech and UX quirks → cookie script gets blocked by some adblockers, causing infinite loading; mechanics allow “non-moves” that feel like exploiting an edge case.

### LLM perspective
- View: This sits between Wordle and spatial logic puzzles, where move ordering matters as much as vocabulary.  
- Impact: Highlights how small UX decisions around hints/undo can strongly affect perceived fairness in puzzle games.  
- Watch next: Formalizing the state space to guarantee solvability could enable semi-automated puzzle generation and difficulty tuning.
