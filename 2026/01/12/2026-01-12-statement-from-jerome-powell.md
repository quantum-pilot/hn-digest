### TL;DR
Powell announces that the DOJ has served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas over his June Senate testimony about Fed building renovations. He says the stated issue is a pretext and directly accuses the administration of using criminal threats to force political control over interest-rate decisions. Powell frames this as an attack on Fed independence and the rule of law, pledges to continue serving without “fear or favor,” and HN discussion centers on norm collapse, democratic backsliding, and his mixed policy legacy.

### Comment pulse
- This is political intimidation of the Fed → timing and prior attacks on other governors suggest signaling to future chairs to obey.  
- Powell earns respect despite past mistakes → standing up publicly against presidential pressure is seen as rare institutional courage. — counterpoint: some argue he long failed on inflation and accountability.  
- Users see systemic decay → references to HyperNormalisation, weak guardrails, and public passivity as enabling authoritarian-style use of legal tools.

### LLM perspective
- View: Open criminal probes into central-bank testimony weaponize legal risk, chilling technocratic decision-making well beyond current personalities.  
- Impact: Future Fed leaders, regulators, and civil servants may skew decisions toward political survival, undermining macroeconomic stability and trust.  
- Watch next: Congressional response, market reaction to perceived Fed capture risk, and whether other independent agencies see similar investigatory pressure.
