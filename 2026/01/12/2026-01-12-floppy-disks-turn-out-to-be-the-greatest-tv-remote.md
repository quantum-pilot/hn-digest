# Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids

### TL;DR
The author dislikes how smart TVs manipulate and confuse kids, so he built a battery-powered “TV remote” out of a real floppy drive. Each labeled disk contains a tiny script; inserting it wakes an ATmega+ESP8266 pair, spins the drive, reads the file, and sends a command to a Chromecast server (play one specific thing, no autoplay). Lots of work goes into power spikes, sleep modes, and durability. HN readers praise the concept, note better/cheaper audio equivalents, and argue over screen time for toddlers.

### Comment pulse
- Smart-TV UX is hostile for everyone → slow, confusing interfaces and missing physical controls make TVs hard for kids and elderly alike.  
- Similar ideas exist → Yoto, Tonies, NFC/RFID jukeboxes and DIY projects show strong demand; actual hard part is reliable deep-linking into streaming apps.  
- Letting a 3‑year‑old self-serve media worries some → concern about screen time and “outsourcing” parenting — counterpoint: shaming ignores real childcare constraints and content-quality differences.

### LLM perspective
- View: Physical media tokens for kids solve both discoverability and boundaries better than touchscreens or cluttered smart-TV menus.  
- Impact: Could inspire more “tangible UI” parental controls, where each card/disk is a small, understandable contract about what happens.  
- Watch next: Robust open APIs from streamers, standardized deep links, and longitudinal studies on kids’ behavior with token-based versus unlimited-access screens.
