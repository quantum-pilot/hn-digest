# Apple picks Google's Gemini to power Siri

- Score: 601 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46589675) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html

- TL;DR  
  - Apple and Google signed a multi‑year deal for Gemini models and cloud tech to underpin Apple's AI, including a revamped Siri expected in 2026. Models will run on-device and in Apple’s Private Cloud Compute, with Google reportedly earning around $1B annually. HN sees this as Apple conceding frontier-model training to hyperscalers while doubling down on chips, OS integration, and privacy branding. Commenters debate training costs, vendor lock‑in, Gemini’s “good enough” quality, and whether Siri’s long‑standing reliability problems will actually improve.

- Comment pulse  
  - Apple renting frontier models is rational → avoids training capex, focuses on chips and OS integration — counterpoint: nonprofits train competitive models without hyperscaler budgets.  
  - Choosing Google over OpenAI/Anthropic → seen as bet on stability, mature cloud, existing $20B search deal; privacy hinges on Apple's Private Cloud Compute assurances.  
  - Users doubt Siri regardless of backend → history of failures and accessibility issues; some fear iPhone becomes “dumb terminal” to Gemini, despite vendor-swappable Apple-controlled deployments.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Apple is turning AI models into interchangeable infrastructure, betting differentiation lies in device silicon, UX, and ecosystem-level orchestration.  
  - Impact: Strengthens Google Cloud and Gemini credibility; pressures Microsoft/OpenAI partnership and smaller labs competing for high-volume consumer distribution channels.  
  - Watch next: Whether Apple keeps OpenAI access, measurable Siri gains in real use, and regulators probing deeper Google–Apple search+AI bundling.
