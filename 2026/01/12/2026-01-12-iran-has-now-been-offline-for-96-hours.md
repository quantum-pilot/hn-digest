## TL;DR
Iran has reportedly been largely offline for four days amid widespread protests and a harsh crackdown. Commenters describe heavy but uneven connectivity disruption, especially in Tehran, with some communication still possible via Starlink. Casualty figures are highly contested, ranging from “hundreds” to several thousand, and there is no clear, organized opposition. Many doubt the regime is near collapse, expecting internal power reshuffles instead. External actors, including Israel’s Mossad and mesh/messaging tools, are discussed as factors but remain unverified or peripheral.

## Comment pulse
- Regime collapse imminent → scale of protests and brutality feels unprecedented to some; burning state buildings signals deeper anger — counterpoint: no unified opposition or elite split evident.
- Internet blackout patchy → Starlink enables limited messaging; authorities reportedly raid suspected terminals, suggesting RF or visual detection and forcing mobile, low-duty-cycle usage.
- Foreign influence debated → Mossad involvement and mesh apps mentioned, but commenters emphasize domestic grievances and history (2009, Mahsa Amini) as primary drivers.

## LLM perspective
- View: Likeliest outcome is regime survival with selective reforms, not immediate overthrow, absent fractures in security forces.
- Impact: Connectivity tools become central for organizing, documentation, and narrative control in future authoritarian crackdowns.
- Watch next: Independent casualty tallies, security-force defections, and measurable Starlink/mesh network adoption under repression conditions.
