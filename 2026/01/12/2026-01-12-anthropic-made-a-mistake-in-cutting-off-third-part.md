# Anthropic made a mistake in cutting off third-party clients

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586766) | Link: https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic

### TL;DR
Anthropic silently blocked users from piping their discounted Claude Pro/Max subscriptions into third‑party coding agents like OpenCode, forcing them back into the official Claude Code client. The article frames this as a strategic blunder: it angers paying devs, signals a desire to control the whole coding stack, and hands OpenAI an opening as it explicitly embraces OpenCode and similar tools with ChatGPT/Codex subscriptions. Hacker News is split between viewing this as self‑sabotage and as a rational attempt to avoid becoming a commodity model provider.

### Comment pulse

- Defending Anthropic → Claude Code is underpriced vs API, OpenCode makes Claude easily swappable; protecting the client preserves margins and data, especially in dev/enterprise niches.  

- Ecosystem worry → Silent lock‑in move plus mediocre agent UX erodes goodwill and open‑source norms; devs risk ending up tool‑owned, not tool‑owners — counterpoint: most won’t care long‑term.  

- Pragmatic take → Platforms routinely block third‑party clients (Reddit, Twitter); Anthropic can dictate subscription usage, and a small alt‑agent minority likely won’t move the business.

### LLM perspective

- View: Coding agents, not raw models, are becoming the real product; client lock‑in battles will intensify as capabilities converge.  

- Impact: Devs reliant on discounted subscriptions face higher switching costs; open agent projects gain urgency and legitimacy as neutral frontends.  

- Watch next: Subscriber churn vs Claude Code growth, OpenAI’s OpenCode integrations in practice, and whether regulators scrutinize bundling of models and first‑party clients.
