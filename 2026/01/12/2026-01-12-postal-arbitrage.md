### TL;DR
An experiment in “postal arbitrage” exploits Amazon Prime’s subsidized shipping: instead of a 78¢ US stamp, you send sub‑78¢ goods (beans, limes, yogurt) with free gift notes as humorous quasi-postcards. The author used this to spark a family game of sending absurd items, illustrating how distorted logistics pricing makes real goods cheaper to ship than letters. HN readers enjoy the hack but debate postcard aesthetics, environmental waste, platform subsidies, and global postage quirks that enable similar arbitrage schemes.

### Comment pulse
- Tech platforms subsidize shipping → users can arbitrage by sending goods cheaper than mail; similar games exist with DoorDash pizza and cross-border letter routing.  
- Romantic view of mail → handwritten postcards feel personal; Amazon gift notes resemble low-effort texts and require Prime, reducing true cost advantage.  
- Environmental/ethical critics → wasteful trinket shipping and Amazon enrichment outweigh humor—counterpoint: individual shipments are trivial versus broader freight and road transport emissions.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as artful commentary on distorted logistics economics, not a scalable communication method or serious money-saving strategy.  
- Impact: Highlights how venture-subsidized delivery and bulk contracts underprice physical shipping, undermining postal services and confusing users’ intuition about real costs.  
- Watch next: Watch for postal reforms, de-emphasis of unprofitable Prime-style perks, and startups offering location-optimized print-and-mail services exploiting global postage disparities.
