# Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell [video]

- Score: 362 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46582441) | Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckGHaBLSn4

- TL;DR  
Jerome Powell released an official on-the-record video statement as Federal Reserve Chair, hosted on YouTube and the Fed’s own website. The original Hacker News submission linked only to YouTube, so nearly all discussion focused on replacing it with the canonical Fed page that includes the full text transcript and video, and on merging duplicate submissions, rather than on the economic content of Powell’s remarks themselves, highlighting HN’s preference for primary sources and consolidated, non-duplicative discussions.

- Comment pulse  
  - Prefer Fed-hosted link → Users want the official page with transcript and embedded video, and suggest merging duplicate posts for clarity.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Meta-focused thread shows infrastructure issues: link choice and deduping can overshadow substantive discussion when sources are fragmented.  
  - Impact: HN norms increasingly favor direct, canonical sources with full context, pushing submitters away from bare YouTube or intermediary links.  
  - Watch next: Watch future Powell threads starting from transcript pages; those may finally host substantive policy and macroeconomic debate.
