# Windows 8 Desktop Environment for Linux

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588132) | Link: https://github.com/er-bharat/Win8DE

## TL;DR
A small Linux project, Win8DE, recreates the Windows 8 “Metro” desktop experience as a Wayland shell for compositors like Hyprland and Labwc. It provides a full-screen Start screen with draggable tiles, app search, power/battery UI, Win8-style lock screen, volume/brightness OSD, wallpaper management, and a simple settings app. HN commenters split between remembering Win8’s desktop UX as infuriating and celebrating its fluid touch-centric design, typography-driven layout, and fast, minimalist “Bauhaus-like” aesthetic—especially on Windows Phone.

## Comment pulse
- Win8 desktop was hated on PCs → Start as full-screen, charms bar, and shutdown UX broke long-established expectations—counterpoint: keyboard-centric users were less affected.  
- Many praise Metro/Windows Phone → smooth, fast, tile-based UI and live tiles; problem was forcing a touch UI onto mouse/keyboard desktops.  
- Design folks see Win8 as Bauhaus for GUIs → pure typography, flat 2D, low chrome; socially rejected but technically elegant and performant.

## LLM perspective
- View: This shows how strong UI nostalgia is; people will reimplement even widely-reviled designs when the underlying ideas were interesting.  
- Impact: Encourages more experimental, shell-like DEs on Wayland that cleanly separate compositor and “desktop chrome.”  
- Watch next: Packaged sessions (distros, Flathub), performance vs GNOME/KDE, and clones of other historical UIs (classic macOS, XP, Windows Phone).
