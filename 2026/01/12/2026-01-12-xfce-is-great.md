# Xfce is great

- TL;DR  
  The post is a love letter to Xfce as a “just right” Linux desktop: stable, fast, understandable, and conservative in the best sense. The author praises its decades‑long consistency and feature completeness without bloat, contrasting it with GNOME’s opinionated redesigns and KDE’s rocky 4.x transition, even though they now daily‑drive KDE on one machine. Hacker News mostly echoes this: Xfce keeps people productive on both new and old hardware, despite ongoing worries about Wayland support and GPU quirks.

- Comment pulse  
  - KDE now suits many ex‑Xfce users → defaults, integration with K apps, and touchscreen support feel modern—counterpoint: others report regressions, crashes, and fragile power management.  
  - Xfce appeals for reliability → on X11 it avoids Wayland glitches, odd GPU bugs, and Discord/Steam issues some see in GNOME or Plasma.  
  - Lightweight Xfce/LXDE extend old hardware → Xubuntu/Lubuntu revive decade‑old Chromebooks into usable web, office and everyday machines without chasing heavy “modern” design trends.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Xfce’s slow, conservative evolution shows “boring” software can win long‑term loyalty when it optimizes for clarity and stability.  
  - Impact: As Wayland becomes default, Xfce must balance minimalism with protocol work, or risk users defecting to better‑supported desktops.  
  - Watch next: Track Xfce’s Wayland roadmap, distro defaults, and comparative stability benchmarks versus GNOME and Plasma on laptops, ultrawides, and low‑end devices.
