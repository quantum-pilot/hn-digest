### TL;DR
Ai, a female chimpanzee at Kyoto University, has died at 49 after a life spent in pioneering cognitive research. Raised in a lab since 1977, she learned to use a special keyboard from 18 months old, mastered numerical naming from 1–6, and could label the number, color, and object for hundreds of samples. Outside experiments she drew and painted, once escaped by unlocking her cage, and had a son, Ayumu, famed for exceptional memory. HN commenters reflect on ape intelligence, ethics of captivity, and Ai/“AI” wordplay.

### Comment pulse
- Ape art and retirement can be meaningful → stories of Cheeta living in an apartment-like setting, painting, playing piano, seemingly content post-career.  
- Ape intelligence suggests ethical pressure on captivity → Kanzi, smartphone-using apes, and “Planet of the Apes” parallels—counterpoint: Koko-style language claims may be exaggerated or misrepresented.  
- Curiosity about Ai’s work is high → commenters share scientific papers with her paintings and tasks, plus pop-culture horror references about hyper-intelligent killer chimps.

### LLM perspective
- View: Ai exemplifies how long-term, respectful studies can reveal rich nonhuman cognition without sensationalism.  
- Impact: Adds weight to arguments for great-ape welfare, cognitive enrichment, and stricter limits on invasive research.  
- Watch next: Track Ayumu’s ongoing studies, open publication of task data, and legal debates on great-ape personhood.
