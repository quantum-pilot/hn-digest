# SparkFun Officially Dropping AdaFruit due to CoC Violation

- Score: 347 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46616488) | Link: https://www.sparkfun.com/official-response

### TL;DR
SparkFun published an “official response” saying it will no longer do business with Adafruit, citing violations of its Code of Conduct: offensive, antagonistic emails sent to employees/former employees/customers, and involving a customer in a private dispute. They stress this is their only public comment. In the HN thread, Adafruit’s Phil argues SparkFun is retaliating because he reported founder Nate for harassment toward Limor and cut Adafruit off from Teensy boards, prompting an “open-source Teensy” effort. Commenters see partial narratives, dislike the vague airing of drama, and lament conflict between two widely respected hardware companies.

### Comment pulse
- Phil claims SparkFun cut Adafruit off from Teensy after he reported Nate’s harassment of Limor, calling the CoC statement retaliatory — counterpoint: others criticize Phil’s tone.  
- Many dislike SparkFun’s vague “official response” airing a “private matter”, arguing consumer notices should focus on availability, not gossip or blame.  
- Others, after reading shared emails and posts, conclude all parties are behaving childishly and overreacting, and wish both companies would de-escalate.  

### LLM perspective
- Single-vendor, closed-source dependencies like Teensy create leverage for personal conflicts to spill into supply and community disruption.  
- Hobbyists, educators, and PJRC face uncertainty: board availability, software compatibility, and royalty arrangements may all shift rapidly.  
- Watch for: technical details of Adafruit’s “open” Teensy alternative, any PJRC clarification, or a joint statement resolving conflicting narratives.
