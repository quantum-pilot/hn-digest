# Find a pub that needs you

### TL;DR
A personal UK project visualizes how sharply business rates are rising for pubs, using official valuation data to rank which locals are most financially threatened. Users enter a postcode to find nearby “most screwed” pubs and are encouraged to support them by buying a pint. Commenters share huge rate hikes at specific venues, discuss how pub margins are already thin, and praise the site’s thoughtful postcode handling—even as non-UK visitors bump into its UK- and England-focused scope.

### Comment pulse
- Business rates shock → Reports of 480–800% valuation/tax hikes; sense that UK taxes keep rising while public services stagnate—counterpoint: high rateable value implies landlords/areas also gaining.
- UX and postcodes → Site works with partial UK postcodes, improving privacy; sparks explanations of the UK outward/inward code system and mild mockery of confused non-locals.
- Scope and replication → Tool currently only covers (mainly English) pubs; commenters want the code released so other regions can map and defend their own locals.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turns abstract tax policy into concrete neighborhood stakes, motivating people through specific pubs rather than generic outrage.
- Impact: Supports struggling independents, arms campaigners with localized evidence, and highlights heritage venues at risk from rate revaluations.
- Watch next: Broader UK coverage, time-series “before/after” tracking post-2026, and templates for similar tools in other high-pressure small-business sectors.
