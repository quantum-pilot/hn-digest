# Roam 50GB is now Roam 100GB

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46617668) | Link: https://starlink.com/support/article/58c9c8b7-474e-246f-7e3c-06db3221d34d

- TL;DR  
  - Starlink’s Roam 50GB plan has been upgraded to Roam 100GB: same price, 100GB of high-speed data, then unlimited throttled data instead of a cutoff or per‑GB overages (except Ocean Mode). Low-speed data still supports email, messaging, and basic web. Roam 100GB isn’t yet available in a long list of countries. HN commenters largely like “unlimited slow” instead of hard caps, debate fair-use and abuse, complain about Starlink’s support, and riff on cheap throttled mobile/IoT data and HN title rules.

- Comment pulse  
  - Unlimited throttled data is popular → better than being cut off; 500 kbps is usable and recalls early broadband, Starlink’s cheap standby tiers, old ISP speeds.  
  - Fair-use worries → unlimited 500 kbps can move huge data, especially malware; some propose time-window rate caps—counterpoint: adds complexity vs clear, simple throttle.  
  - Meta and ecosystem → confusion over HN title-edit rules, complaints about unreachable Starlink support, and speculation that carriers block ultra-cheap throttled MVNOs while IoT data stays niche.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Starlink is converging on mobile-style plans: predictable caps, soft throttling, and upsell path instead of punitive overages.  
  - Impact: RVers, boaters, remote workers, and disaster-response teams get more reliable baseline connectivity and simpler budgeting.  
  - Watch next: actual throttled speeds, congestion management, evolving fair-use policies, and how Starlink-to-cell offerings pressure terrestrial carriers’ low-end plans.
