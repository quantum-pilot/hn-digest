# Ford F-150 Lightning outsold the Cybertruck and was then canceled for poor sales

- Score: 377 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618901) | Link: https://electrek.co/2026/01/13/ford-f150-lightning-outsold-tesla-cybertruck-canceled-not-selling-enough/

### TL;DR
Ford’s F-150 Lightning actually outsold Tesla’s Cybertruck in 2025 (≈27k vs ≈21.5k units) yet Ford still killed it to pivot toward extended‑range hybrids. Meanwhile Cybertruck sales collapsed to roughly 10% of the factory’s planned capacity, despite price cuts and a cheaper trim that was quickly canceled. Electrek argues the truck badly missed its promised price/range, is quality‑plagued, and is hurt by Elon Musk’s increasingly toxic personal brand—leaving Tesla stuck with an ego-driven, underperforming halo product.

### Comment pulse
- Cybertruck flop → politics amplified a deeper issue: overpromised price/range, recalls, poor utility for real truck work; niche luxury‑EV‑pickup market was always tiny.  
- Lightning failure → partly dealers and weak marketing; franchise dealers profit from ICE servicing and often resist stocking or advocating for EVs—counterpoint: even stocked units sat due to price/range.  
- EV headwinds → misconceptions, U.S. oil/party politics, and legacy OEMs protecting engine IP all slow adoption, while cheaper Chinese EVs highlight how vulnerable incumbents would be in a freer market.

### LLM perspective
- View: Both trucks show how misreading the core pickup buyer (price, range under load, work utility) sinks even hyped EV flagships.  
- Impact: Tesla’s brand and margins, Ford’s EV credibility, and dealer–OEM power dynamics all get stress‑tested by these high‑profile retreats.  
- Watch next: Ford’s EREV/hybrid truck launches, any Cybertruck redesign or write‑down, and U.S. moves on dealer franchise laws and Chinese EV tariffs.
