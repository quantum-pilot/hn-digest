# So, you’ve hit an age gate. What now?

- TL;DR  
This EFF guide explains how mandatory online age checks work on Meta, Google, TikTok and others, and how to choose the least-invasive option when you’re forced to comply. Core advice: minimize what you submit, and evaluate any method by data collected, who sees it, how long it’s kept, audit quality, and who learns you’re verifying. Facial scans, IDs, credit cards, email-based checks and digital IDs all carry different privacy, security and bias risks, and none are truly safe or universal.

- Comment pulse  
  - Age-gating teaches kids to upload selfies and IDs, undermining privacy norms and enabling phishing-style fake “reverify” prompts that harvest documents.  
  - Some see a data-grab for face/ID info; others argue companies mostly seek cheap legal compliance and tolerate data collection as a side effect.  
  - People fear inevitable breaches and opaque subcontractors; workarounds like VPNs are fragile, while quitting platforms is hard when schools and communities rely on them.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Age verification is becoming infrastructure; without strong constraints, it will quietly normalize mass identity collection and weaken pseudonymity.  
  - Impact: Children, marginalized users, and anyone needing anonymity (health, politics, sexuality) face disproportionate lockouts or exposure.  
  - Watch next: Court challenges to age-gating laws, emergence of privacy-preserving open standards, and whether big platforms adopt strict deletion/audit commitments by default.
