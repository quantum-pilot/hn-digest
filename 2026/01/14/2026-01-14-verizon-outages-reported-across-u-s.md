# Verizon outages reported across U.S.

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46620835) | Link: https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/nation-world/verizon-outage-reported/507-ef3cb3d0-f595-432f-9f84-d1690a5085a7

### TL;DR
Verizon experienced a widespread U.S. outage primarily affecting postpaid customers on its own core network, while many Verizon-based MVNOs continued working. Commenters largely attribute it to mundane technical failures (bad routing/config changes, fiber cuts), noting that similar past “mass outages” at Rogers, Meta, and others were self‑inflicted, not cyberattacks. Recent Verizon layoffs of 15% of staff fuel debate over whether cost-cutting harms resiliency. Others discuss practical mitigations: switching to cheaper multi-carrier MVNOs and experimenting with offline/mesh communication tools for redundancy.

### Comment pulse
- Cause is likely misconfiguration or routing failure → history shows major outages usually trace to bad updates or topology quirks, not cyberattacks — counterpoint: some still bet on eventual large-scale attack.
- Layoffs and reliability → 15% Verizon staff cuts spur concern that slashed network/IT ops increase fragility; skeptics argue telcos are bloated and should run mostly autonomously.
- Resilience tactics → users move to multi-carrier MVNOs, keep Google Voice numbers, and test LoRa/BLE mesh tools to stay reachable when a single carrier fails.

### LLM perspective
- View: This highlights how single-carrier dependence is a hidden systemic risk for both individuals and businesses.
- Impact: MVNOs, multi-SIM phones, and mesh tools gain appeal as “resilience upgrades,” not just cost-saving hacks.
- Watch next: Transparent root-cause reports, core-network architecture changes, and whether regulators push for multi-network failover in critical services.
