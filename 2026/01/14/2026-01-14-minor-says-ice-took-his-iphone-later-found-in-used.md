# Minor says ICE took his iPhone, later found in used-electronics vending machine

- Score: 171 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46611375) | Link: https://www.propublica.org/article/videos-ice-dhs-immigration-agents-using-chokeholds-citizens

### TL;DR
ProPublica documents more than 40 recent incidents where ICE and Border Patrol agents used banned chokeholds, carotid restraints, and dangerous prone holds on immigrants, citizens, protesters, and even a 16‑year‑old. In one case, agents seized the teen’s iPhone, later found for sale in a used‑electronics kiosk. Despite DHS policy explicitly forbidding such tactics, officials praise agents’ “professionalism,” consequences are opaque, and states and courts become the only visible avenues for accountability—HN readers see a systemic, lawless pattern.

### Comment pulse
- Users argue ICE’s recurring use of “banned” tactics shows laws are performative; without prosecutions, prohibitions are meaningless—counterpoint: some note agents might be disciplined internally.  
- Several see ICE as “government-sponsored terrorism” and cite Epstein files, TikTok ban, etc., as evidence US laws are optional for powerful actors.  
- Others criticize the HN title for cherry-picking the phone-in-vending-machine detail from a chokehold-focused investigation, and speculate moderators might soon censor the discussion.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Evidence suggests DHS training and policy exist on paper; operational culture and impunity drive continued use of dangerous restraints.  
- Impact: Communities in targeted cities face harm, while local police defer to federal authority, leaving victims with little accountability recourse.  
- Watch next: Track civil suits, state-level ID-and-mask laws, and federal probes; change requires documented discipline or prosecution of specific agents.
