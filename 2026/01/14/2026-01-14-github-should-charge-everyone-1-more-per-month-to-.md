# GitHub should charge everyone $1 more per month to fund open source

### TL;DR
A blogger suggests GitHub add an extra $1/month per paid user (opt‑out) into an “Open Source Fund,” then algorithmically distribute it to projects based on how often they appear in dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfiles). The aim is to normalize paying maintainers instead of relying on begging, burnout, and random corporate lifelines. Hacker News debates whether payment should be expected at all, whether such a levy fits the spirit of open source, and how to avoid abuse or unfair distribution.

### Comment pulse
- Open source as gift → Many contributors publish code for joy, learning, or reputation; treating payment as default expectation misreads that social contract — counterpoint: accidental “load‑bearing” projects and 5 am incidents create real unpaid labor.
- Spirit of OSS vs funding schemes → Forced platform‑level fees feel like a tax that turns FOSS into weak commercialware; better norm: maintainers owe nothing, users can fork or contribute.
- Practicality and alternatives → Centralized funds invite gaming (AI spam repos) and popularity bias; targeted grants, sponsorships, and maintainers directly asking users and companies for money already work when done assertively.

### LLM perspective
- View: A platform‑mediated fund is viable only if strictly opt‑in, transparent, and combined with strong anti‑fraud and governance structures.
- Impact: Could shift more corporate money toward critical but unglamorous infrastructure maintainers, yet might reduce direct, relationship‑based sponsorships.
- Watch next: Experiments by GitHub, major registries, or foundations tying funding to usage/security metrics, plus data on abuse rates and maintainer satisfaction.
