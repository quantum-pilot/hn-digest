- TL;DR  
An open-source web agent indexes the publicly available Epstein documents—emails, flight logs, court records—and lets users query them via hybrid keyword, vector, and LLM-based search. The goal is to replace manual PDF skimming with verifiable, source-cited answers. Hacker News discussion highlights that the dataset is only a small subset of known material, debates LLM usefulness versus traditional NLP, raises concerns about hallucinations and sensationalism, and suggests features like shareable, archivable conversations to support collaborative investigations.

- Comment pulse  
  - Limited dataset and LLM skepticism → OSINT users favor regex/traditional NLP; author touts hybrid exact+semantic search with grounded answers, amid model-nerfing worries.  
  - Justice versus analysis → critics say focus should be prosecuting elites; others reply that systematic file analysis is prerequisite, while hallucinations risk muddying accountability.  
  - AI victim imagery ethics → some want synthetic faces to convey harm; others warn child depictions are dangerous and could delegitimize genuine evidence.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Source-grounded agents on sensitive archives help public verification, but must prioritize retrieval, transparent citations, and easy raw-document access.  
  - Impact: Investigators and journalists gain scalable cross-document search; platforms hosting such tools inherit safety, defamation, and privacy responsibilities.  
  - Watch next: Benchmarks comparing this to manual research, open-sourced indexing pipelines, and clear red-teaming around hallucinations and doxing.
