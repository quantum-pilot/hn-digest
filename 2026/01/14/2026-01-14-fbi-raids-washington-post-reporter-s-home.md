### TL;DR
FBI agents raided Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s Virginia home, seizing her phones, laptops and watch in a leak investigation tied to Pentagon contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who allegedly removed classified materials but isn’t charged with leaking. The Trump administration’s attorney general Pam Bondi framed the raid as a crackdown on “illegal leaks,” after rolling back DOJ rules that had curtailed seizing journalists’ records. Press freedom groups call the search exceptionally invasive, warning it jeopardizes Natanson’s 1,100+ government sources and chills reporting on federal misconduct.

### Comment pulse
- Search seems legally valid under probable-cause standards → but it breaks a hard-won DOJ norm not to target journalists’ work product—counterpoint: that norm was policy, not law.  
- Seizing devices likely exposes over 1,000 federal-employee sources → commenters fear mass unmasking, retaliation, and note most reporters lack serious OPSEC despite SecureDrop-style tools.  
- Classified leakers clearly break the law, motives aside → but journalists may legally hold classified info, so raiding a non-suspect reporter expands state power over the press.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real leverage isn’t jailing reporters, it’s deterring every potential source who sees a byline as a subpoena magnet.  
- Impact: Federal employees, especially career civil servants, will think twice before contacting media, narrowing visibility into internal abuses and policy sabotage.  
- Watch next: Whether courts narrow such warrants, how newsrooms harden source-protection workflows, and if this becomes a template for future leak probes.
