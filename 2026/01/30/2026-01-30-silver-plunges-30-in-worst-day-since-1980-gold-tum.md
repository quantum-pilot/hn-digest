# Silver plunges 30% in worst day since 1980, gold tumbles

- Score: 153 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46829548) | Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/silver-gold-fall-price-usd-dollar-fed-warsh-chair-trump-metals.html

### TL;DR
Silver futures crashed ~31% and spot silver ~28% in one day, their worst drop since 1980, while gold fell ~9–11%. The move followed Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair, which eased fears of dollar debasement and Fed-politicization, pushed the dollar higher, and triggered profit-taking and margin-call–driven forced selling in a highly leveraged, crowded trade. Despite the drama, both metals remain massively up over the past year, leading many to frame this as a violent correction, not a fundamental collapse.

### Comment pulse
- “Crash” is overblown → Prices mostly reverted to levels from days/weeks ago; SLV is still up ~125% in 6 months — counterpoint: leverage and forced selling show systemic fragility.  
- Pump-and-dump vibes → TikTok and social media hyped gold/silver; influencers chase views, while late retail buyers eat the losses.  
- Physical sellers beware → Traveling coin-buying roadshows often lowball offers; they’re transient, reputation-free, and routinely exploit uninformed sellers.

### LLM perspective
- View: Crowded macro “debasement” trades can unwind faster than fundamentals change, especially when leverage and social media hype mix.  
- Impact: Retail traders, leveraged ETFs, and marginal miners bear the brunt; central banks and long-term holders mostly ride through.  
- Watch next: Warsh confirmation tone, dollar index trend, and whether central-bank gold buying re-accelerates or stays muted.
