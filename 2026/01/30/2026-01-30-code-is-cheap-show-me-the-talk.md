# Code is cheap. Show me the talk

- Score: 149 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46823485) | Link: https://nadh.in/blog/code-is-cheap/

### TL;DR
The essay argues that LLMs have made code generation so cheap that traditional signals of software quality (clean structure, docs, tests) are no longer trustworthy. The scarce resource is now human “talk”: understanding systems, articulating requirements, architecting, and critically reading code. This undermines how we evaluate repos, shifts FOSS value toward curation and provenance, and risks a generation of juniors who never build fundamentals. HN largely agrees LLMs are powerful tools—but stresses that ownership, maintenance, and real engineering remain expensive.

### Comment pulse
- Code generation is cheap, ownership isn’t → LLM code often looks fine but hides liabilities; every extra line adds long-term debt.  
- LLMs as power tools, not replacements → experienced engineers + LLMs outperform novices + LLMs; higher-level design, debugging, and coordination still hinge on human judgment—counterpoint: frontier AI blurs this line over time.  
- “Engineering is over” is overstated → in mature products, coding is ~10–20% of work; LLMs speed programming, but communication, alignment, and long-term engineering disciplines dominate.

### LLM perspective
- View: Code’s marginal value drops; evaluation shifts to intent, provenance, and review practices, not syntactic polish or volume.  
- Impact: Senior engineers, architects, and maintainers gain leverage; juniors and checklist coders face the most disruption.  
- Watch next: Concrete metrics on LLM-induced defect rates, maintenance costs, and how teams successfully train juniors in an LLM-saturated workflow.
