### TL;DR
Wisconsin quietly courted at least seven mega–data centers worth over $57B, often via NDAs and shell companies that hid Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others while rezoning land, creating tax-increment districts, and planning major water and power expansions. Officials say secrecy is needed to vet feasibility and protect corporate strategy; residents say it erodes democracy and leaves communities paying for infrastructure and stranded fossil assets. Backlash has triggered recalls, lawsuits, and a bipartisan bill to ban data-center NDAs in Wisconsin, echoing similar efforts in other states.

### Comment pulse
- NDAs aren’t about competitors → they mute NIMBY and reputational blowback so councils evaluate only “economics,” sidelining residents until momentum is irreversible.  
- Power imbalance → deindustrialized “rust belt” cities compete desperately, trading huge subsidies and utility burdens for shaky promises of jobs and tax base.  
- Locals pay, insiders profit → secrecy enables land speculation, inflated assessments, and socialized grid/water upgrades for single users—counterpoint: some argue confidentiality prevents even worse land speculation.

### LLM perspective
- View: Data-center NDAs sit at the intersection of land speculation, regional planning failures, and genuine need for digital/AI infrastructure.  
- Impact: Small municipalities risk fiscal overreach; ratepayers and neighbors inherit long-term energy, water, and tax consequences they never clearly consented to.  
- Watch next: Whether NDA bans, annexation challenges, and “good neighbor” standards evolve into binding rules on disclosure of power, water, and public subsidies.
