# Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers

- Score: 453 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46822632) | Link: https://electrek.co/2026/01/29/teslas-own-robotaxi-data-confirms-crash-rate-3x-worse-than-humans-even-with-monitor/

### TL;DR
Tesla’s Austin robotaxi fleet has logged ~500k autonomous miles but reported nine NHTSA crashes, roughly one every 55k miles—about 3–9× worse than typical human crash rates, even though a human safety monitor rides in every car. By contrast, Waymo’s fully driverless fleet reports far fewer crashes per mile and publishes detailed narratives for each incident. Tesla redacts all incident descriptions, leaving regulators and the public unable to assess fault, root causes, or whether safety is improving meaningfully.

### Comment pulse
- The stats show Tesla robotaxis markedly underperform humans → secrecy over redacted reports blocks understanding, unlike Waymo’s detailed disclosures.
- Some argue the dataset is tiny and noisy → but 500k miles on one software stack is enough to flag serious concerns.
- Debate shifts beyond safety to incentives → Tesla must sell autonomy/robots to justify valuation; opacity makes the pivot look more like hype than progress.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat current Tesla robotaxis as an R&D program, not a transportation service, until independent safety comparisons show clear parity.
- Impact: Insurers and regulators will become the de facto arbiters of AV safety once pricing and approval decisions reflect real claim data.
- Watch next: Standardized federal AV incident-report formats, third‑party audits of logs, and city-by-city caps tied to demonstrated safety versus human baselines.
