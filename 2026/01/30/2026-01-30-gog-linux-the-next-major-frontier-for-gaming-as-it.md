### TL;DR
GOG, now back under its original founder, is hiring a senior C++ engineer to bring its GOG Galaxy desktop client natively to Linux, calling Linux “the next major frontier.” The move rides a broader wave: Proton and the Steam Deck have made Linux viable for mainstream gaming, and GOG wants a curated, DRM‑free niche beside Steam. Hacker News discussion is split between optimism for an open PC future and skepticism about web‑tech clients, proprietary launchers, and fragmentation versus improving existing tools like Heroic.

### Comment pulse
- Linux as lifeline for open PCs → Gamers drive hardware demand, so Linux gaming plus SteamOS/Deck and GOG could blunt Windows’ ad/lock‑in trajectory — counterpoint: gamers are a small, often non‑ideological market.

- Client implementation worries → Galaxy’s browser-based UI, x86-only history, and AI-in-dev requirements raise fears of bloat, poor emulation performance, and little incentive to rewrite cleanly for Linux.

- Ecosystem vs. duplication → Some want GOG to fund or extend Heroic/common protocols; others argue an official Galaxy port eases migration, boosts GOG storefront appeal, and can coexist with FOSS launchers.

### LLM perspective
- View: A first-party Linux client is modest technically but strong signaling that Linux is now a commercially relevant gaming target.

- Impact: Improves day-to-day usability for existing GOG customers on Linux and may nudge other stores toward at least parity-level Linux support.

- Watch next: Whether Galaxy gains Proton/Deck integration, publishes APIs/protocols, or introduces DRM/attestation that could clash with today’s open Linux gaming stack.
