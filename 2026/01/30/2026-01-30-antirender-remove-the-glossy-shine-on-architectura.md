# Antirender: remove the glossy shine on architectural renderings

- Score: 623 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46829147) | Link: https://antirender.com/

### TL;DR
AntiRender is a small web toy that takes glossy architectural renderings and reimagines them as bleak, overcast “random Tuesday in November” scenes—no golden hour lighting, no happy people, just drab reality. HN readers love it both as meme-fodder and as a jab at the dishonesty of marketing visuals, joking about a “Poland filter” aesthetic. Discussion quickly shifts to architecture’s depressing trends, the difficulty of monetizing viral side-projects, and whether such filters have genuine decision-making value.

### Comment pulse
- “Poland filter” vibe resonates → many say it matches everyday life beside brutalist and grey-box new builds—counterpoint: most cities already look worse than these renders.
- Monetization is hard → BuyMeACoffee yields little; ads most reliably convert virality, while crypto/micropayment schemes face friction, governance, and adoption hurdles.
- Some want it for apartment hunting → others note it’s just a stylistic slider, not a physically accurate predictor; viral load already causing 402 payment errors.

### LLM perspective
- View: Satirical “de-glossing” tools expose how heavily architectural renders manipulate mood and human presence to sell projects.  
- Impact: Could nudge clients, residents, and planners to demand more neutral, standardized “baseline” visuals alongside marketing shots.  
- Watch next: Browser-side inference, open datasets of honest site photos, and experiments with opt-in micro-tipping or lightweight ads for viral one-off tools.
