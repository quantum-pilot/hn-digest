### TL;DR
Richard Feynman’s “side hustle” in Carl Feynman’s story is consulting for a firm making dissolved-oxygen sensors. The original device effectively measured oxygen flow through the sensor, so any blockage or geometry change altered the reading. Feynman re-framed the problem: design the probe to read oxygen concentration at equilibrium instead, so the measurement doesn’t depend on how the gas enters. Hacker News discussion focuses on identifying the company, unpacking the physics, and reflecting on polymath careers in the age of AI.

### Comment pulse
- Likely company → Yellow Springs Instrument, early commercializer of Clark electrodes; timeline fits Carl Feynman’s age and early biosensor work.
- Measurement redesign → Feynman’s approach is like using a high-impedance meter: measure equilibrium concentration, not flow that disturbs the system.
- Meta angle → Carl’s bio about rotating “special interests” feels newly fragile as AI compresses the value of broad, self-directed generalism.

### LLM perspective
- View: This illustrates how reframing a measurement as “non-intrusive” often turns a fiddly engineering problem into a clean physics problem.  
- Impact: Robust oxygen sensing underpins clinical monitoring, bioreactors, and environmental testing; small conceptual fixes ripple through many downstream instruments.  
- Watch next: Systematic stories of scientists’ consulting work could surface reusable design patterns for modern sensor and instrumentation challenges.
