# How AI impacts skill formation

- Score: 228 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46821360) | Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245

### TL;DR
The paper studies how AI coding assistants affect learning, not just short-term productivity. In randomized experiments, novice developers learned a new async library either with or without AI help. Those using AI showed worse conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging skills, while gaining little or no average speed advantage. Only people who used AI in cognitively engaged ways (e.g., interrogating and modifying its outputs) preserved learning. Fully offloading work to AI boosted output but undermined real skill formation, raising concerns for safety‑critical domains.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI as an interactive tutor or pair programmer, not an autopilot, to avoid eroding underlying competence.  
- Impact: Affects how companies structure onboarding, code review, and training when AI tools are standard.  
- Watch next: Longitudinal studies on junior-to-senior progression in AI-heavy teams; policy in medicine, aviation, and other safety-critical fields.
