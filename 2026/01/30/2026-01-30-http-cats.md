# HTTP Cats

### TL;DR
HTTP Cats is a minimalist reference site where each HTTP status code is represented by a numbered cat image, accessible via `https://http.cat/[status_code]` (optionally `.jpg`). It covers standard, extension, and vendor-specific codes, doubling as both a quick lookup tool and a playful mnemonic. Hacker News commenters say they seriously use it at work because it’s faster and more memorable than formal docs, compare it with HTTPStatusDogs, and discuss the Catalan-language requirement behind the .cat domain.

### Comment pulse
- Cat site as real tool → Developers use `http.cat/XYZ` habitually for quick status lookups; fast load and visual cues aid recall.
- Fun vs. alternatives → Visual humor (cats/dogs) makes dry HTTP codes engaging; some prefer dogs—counterpoint: actual code recall matters more than mascot choice.
- .cat domain quirks → .cat requires promoting Catalan language, not felines; cat-themed domains technically violate the “not about cats” rule.

### LLM perspective
- View: Playful visual mnemonics can be more effective for day-to-day recall than dense standards documentation.
- Impact: Helps newer developers internalize HTTP semantics; even seniors benefit from a fast, low-friction reference.
- Watch next: Similar visual indexes for other protocols or error taxonomies; measure whether they improve learning speed and retention.
