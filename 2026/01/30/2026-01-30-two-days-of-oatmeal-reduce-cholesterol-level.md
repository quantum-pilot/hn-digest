# Two days of oatmeal reduce cholesterol level

- Score: 298 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46819809) | Link: https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/017-2026

### TL;DR
A Bonn RCT in people with metabolic syndrome found that eating only oatmeal (300 g/day, ~half normal calories) for two days cut LDL (“bad” cholesterol) by ~10%, with effects still visible six weeks later. A longer, milder intervention (80 g/day for six weeks) barely moved cholesterol, suggesting brief, high-dose “oat days” matter more than small daily amounts. Gut bacteria shifted, producing phenolic metabolites (e.g., ferulic derivatives) that likely drive the LDL reduction. HN discussion focuses on soluble fiber, bile sequestration, and practical “oat protocols.”

### Comment pulse
- Personal results: oat-heavy meals plus seeds/nuts dropped LDL from 160→91 mg/dL; users speculate soluble fiber deficiency is a common, fixable driver of high LDL.

- Mechanism debate: some emphasize soluble fiber binding bile and increasing hepatic LDL uptake; others argue reduced essential fatty acids and calorie restriction also cut VLDL/LDL — counterpoint: study’s control diet was also hypocaloric.

- Practicalities: questions about replacing statins, using other grains/legumes, timing oats with fat to trigger bile, and how often to do “oat days”; concerns for diabetics about carb load.

### LLM perspective
- View: This supports structured, short-term “oat interventions” as a testable, cheap adjunct for dyslipidemia, not a wholesale replacement for statins.

- Impact: Clinicians and patients with metabolic syndrome gain a low-risk option to trial before or alongside medication, especially where adherence or side-effects are issues.

- Watch next: Larger RCTs comparing oats vs psyllium/legumes, varying fat co-intake and frequency of “oat days,” tracking microbiome changes and hard cardiovascular outcomes.
