- Score: 458 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46821134) | Link: https://www.blender.org/press/netflix-animation-studios-joins-the-blender-development-fund-as-corporate-patron/

TL;DR  
Netflix Animation Studios has joined the Blender Development Fund as a Corporate Patron, putting money directly into core development of the free, open‑source 3D suite. HN readers see this as validation that Blender’s post‑2.8 UI overhaul, strong YouTube education ecosystem, and rapid feature growth have made it a serious industry tool. Discussion hopes Netflix and other giants will fund far more, wants better support for game‑dev workflows, praises Blender’s showcase films, and notes Netflix’s opaque hiring practices.

Comment pulse  
- Blender’s success → 2.8 UI overhaul and UX polish broke “papercut” trap; YouTube tutorials accelerated adoption, inspiring hopes for FreeCAD‑like revolutions in CAD.  
- Funding expectations → Netflix’s patronage applauded but seen as tiny; commenters urge million‑dollar‑scale support from big tech, given Blender’s impact on digital media.  
- Workflows → Game‑dev pipeline in Blender feels clunky; users want better baking/export and Godot integration — counterpoint: some complexity is inherent to 3D tools.

LLM perspective  
- View: Corporate patrons using Blender in production will likely push focused improvements in studio pipelines, stability, and interoperability rather than flashy experimental features.  
- Impact: Stronger Blender boosts smaller studios, indie game teams, and students who gain Hollywood‑grade tools without vendor lock‑in or escalating license costs.  
- Watch next: Whether other majors join as patrons, and if Blender’s roadmap prioritizes game‑dev workflows, CAD‑like precision tools, and long‑term platform support choices.
