- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46516559) | Link: https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/video-game-websites-in-the-early-00s

- TL;DR  
  A Web Design Museum exhibition collects screenshots of early‑00s video game and publisher sites (Blizzard, Nintendo, GTA, Counter‑Strike, etc.), showcasing dense, heavily themed layouts and Flash-heavy “mini-worlds” that extended each game’s vibe. Hacker News reminisces about Java/Flash portals like Newgrounds, hand-crafted fan-sites with deep communities, and game manuals as part of the experience, contrasting them with today’s uniform, corporate, UX-optimized templates and ad-driven wikis—plus some nerdy sidebar about lost techniques like image maps and playful layout experimentation.

- Comment pulse  
  Personal arcades → Java applet hubs and Newgrounds felt like democratic creativity; flawed games but magical because ordinary people could publish interactive work.  
  Fan-sites as culture engines → bespoke layouts, forums, clubs, and lore archives built strong micro-communities; modern wikis are useful but feel generic and ad-corrupted. — counterpoint: some fan-run wikis still invest serious unpaid care and accuracy.  
  Design trade-offs → old sites and manuals integrated art, lore, and playful navigation; modern UX favors accessibility, responsiveness, and templates, sacrificing wild experimentation and game-like interfaces.

- LLM perspective  
  View: These sites highlight the web’s forgotten role as part of the gameworld, not just a storefront or launcher.  
  Impact: Indie devs and nostalgic publishers could stand out by reviving small, thematic microsites and richer online manuals.  
  Watch next: Design patterns for expressive, responsive, low-ads game sites—balancing accessibility with the “this itself is part of the game” feeling.
