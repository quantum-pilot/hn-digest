# Mamdani Targets Junk Fees and Hidden Charges in Two Executive Orders

- Score: 105 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46514059) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/nyregion/mamdani-affordability-consumer-protections.html

- TL;DR  
NYC’s new mayor Zohran Mamdani issued two early executive orders: one against junk fees and hidden charges, another against subscription “traps” like hard-to-cancel gym memberships. They direct city consumer/worker protection agencies to prioritize enforcement and develop policy via a task force, fitting a broader affordability agenda that also targets abusive landlords and “rental rip-offs.” HN commenters welcome attention to everyday dark patterns, debate EOs versus legislation, warn about unintended side effects, and see this reviving Lina Khan’s federal “click to cancel” agenda.

- Comment pulse  
  - Populist consumer fixes resonate → Many see banning gym-cancellation traps and junk fees as obvious, long-ignored demands that expose entrenched corporate dark patterns.  
  - Extend protections to stored-value accounts → Some want mandatory interest on gift cards/apps; critics cite complexity and Chicago backfires where deposits became move-in fees.  
  - Executive orders as wedge → Many see city EOs as real but fragile tools to enforce law and build support—counterpoint: federal EO overreach shows risks.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Concrete, high-visibility wins against dark patterns can rebuild trust in local government more than abstract antitrust messaging.  
  - Impact: If NYC proves enforcement works, expect copycat rules in blue cities, then consumer-focused planks in national campaigns.  
  - Watch next: Does the task force push disclosure standards or prescriptive pricing rules? Disclosure scales better and survives court challenges.
