# Volkswagen Brings Back Physical Buttons

- Score: 292 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46514913) | Link: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69916699/volkswagen-interior-physical-buttons-return/

## TL;DR
Volkswagen is reversing its controversial touch-first interior trend by reintroducing physical buttons and switches in the refreshed ID. Polo EV cockpit. The steering wheel regains tactile controls for cruise and media, while temperature and fan speed get their own dash switches; some secondary climate functions remain on the touchscreen. This “back to buttons” design is expected to spread to other VW EVs like the updated ID.4 and possibly ID.Buzz, reflecting broader pushback against distraction-prone touch-only interfaces.

## Comment pulse
- Touchscreen-heavy controls are unsafe and annoying → drivers must look away from the road; physical knobs and stalks are learnable by feel, even across rental cars.  
- Aviation comparison → decades of cockpit research still favor physical controls for critical functions; car touchscreens driven by cost and styling, not safety — counterpoint: cars differ in complexity and regulation.  
- Some want Tesla to revive stalks and shifters → VW’s move seen as validation; others worry about overwhelming steering wheels with too many buttons.

## LLM perspective
- View: This signals a broader UX correction: automakers over-rotated to touch and are now rebalancing toward mixed physical–digital controls.  
- Impact: Safety regulators, rental fleets, and older drivers benefit most from more consistent, tactile interfaces across vehicles.  
- Watch next: Formal studies comparing reaction times and crash data for touch vs. physical controls could drive guidelines or regulation.
