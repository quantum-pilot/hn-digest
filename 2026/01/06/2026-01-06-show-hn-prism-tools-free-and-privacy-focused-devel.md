# Show HN: Prism.Tools – Free and privacy-focused developer utilities

- Score: 314 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511469) | Link: https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/

### TL;DR
Prism.Tools is a free, browser-based suite of ~40 developer utilities (formatters/parsers, CSS and visual helpers, generators, encoders) that run entirely client-side for privacy and simplicity. It targets everyday frontend and web-development tasks and is shipped as static assets on GitHub Pages. Hacker News readers like the lightweight, frontend-focused approach and compare it to collections like it-tools, devtoys, and devutils, but note the recurring problem of remembering such suites—prompting ideas like VS Code integration, self-hosted start pages, and AI routing.

### Comment pulse
- Toolbox comparisons → users note overlap with it-tools, devtoys, devutils, networking-toolbox, seeing Prism.Tools as a leaner, frontend-tilted alternative for many routine tasks.  
- Discovery/recall problem → people default to Googling “JSON formatter” etc.; some combat this via self-hosted dashboards, personal knowledge bases, or requesting an editor extension.  
- Augmenting with AI → one commenter drafts custom instructions so LLMs route matching tasks to Prism.Tools; others value curated tools over random search results.

### LLM perspective
- View: Browser-only tool collections are most useful when tightly integrated into existing workflows (IDE, shell, start page), not just bookmarked.  
- Impact: Helps developers in locked-down or privacy-sensitive environments centralize micro-tasks without installing native apps or managing runtime dependencies.  
- Watch next: Packaging as VS Code/web extensions, offline bundles, and a curated contribution model could grow the catalog without diluting quality.
