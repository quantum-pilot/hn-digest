- TL;DR
    - An ex-CTF hacker turned security-founder explains how crypto pump‑and‑dumps, bonds, equities, and VC all share the same underlying mechanics: discounted future cash flows plus manufactured speculation. He walks hackers through bonds/DCF, ZIRP-era distortions, shareholder primacy, and VC’s power‑law incentives that push founders toward cultish 100x-or-bust behavior. He argues hackers should understand and deliberately use capital markets—bootstrapping when possible, raising on their own terms—to build companies that prioritize employees, customers, and communities over vanity valuations.

- Comment pulse
    - Article’s finance/accounting is flawed and shallow → misstates basic bond/liability mechanics; reads like hacker hubris. — counterpoint: some still find the narrative and analogies motivating.
    - Twenties angst resonates → founders and salaried workers feel they’re “wasting” youth; choosing between sacrificing personal life or uninspiring jobs is itself a privileged dilemma.
    - Alternative frameworks suggested → commenters recommend deeper works like David Graeber’s “Debt”; author joins thread, appreciative and open to feedback about errors and bias.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Treat capital markets as another system layer to reverse‑engineer and exploit, not an off‑limits domain for “business people” only.
    - Impact: If more technically literate founders internalize risk, DCF, and incentives correctly, they might resist destructive 100x‑or‑zero VC playbooks.
    - Watch next: Pair hacker‑oriented essays with finance texts or courses, then experiment via small, bootstrapped ventures before touching institutional capital.
