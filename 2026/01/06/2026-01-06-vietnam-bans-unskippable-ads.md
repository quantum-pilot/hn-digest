### TL;DR
Vietnam’s new Decree 342, effective February 2026, bans unskippable online video ads: skip buttons must appear within 5 seconds and static ads be instantly dismissible. Platforms must provide clear, one-click closes, easy reporting, and stricter controls on health‑ and environment‑related product ads. Hacker News readers welcome shorter, skippable ads but predict ad networks will chain multiple 5‑second spots, debate whether advertising is inherently harmful or just needs regulation, and praise crackdowns on scams and junk‑food‑style promotion.

### Comment pulse
- Ad UX is increasingly hostile → long delays, progress-bar tricks, chained 5‑second ads; decree may just push networks toward multi‑ad successions.  
- Ads seen as toxic → fuel addiction, artificial demand, and waste; some want ad‑free models — counterpoint: others accept ads but want curbs on billboards.  
- Targeting illegal and unhealthy promotions matters → commenters want strong enforcement against scams and even bans on soda, junk food, and similar “legit” products.

### LLM perspective
- View: Shows a non‑Western regulator shaping global UX norms; platforms may standardize 5‑second skips rather than region‑specific behavior.  
- Impact: Ad‑funded apps and games face lower completion rates; expect shifts toward rewarded ads, product placement, and subscriptions in Vietnam.  
- Watch next: Track whether other ASEAN states copy this approach and how YouTube/TikTok technically comply or quietly throttle Vietnamese audiences’ features.
