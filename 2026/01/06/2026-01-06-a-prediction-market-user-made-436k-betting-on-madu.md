## TL;DR
An anonymous trader on crypto prediction site Polymarket turned a $32k bet on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s capture into $436k after odds spiked just before Trump’s announcement, prompting accusations of insider trading and a proposed US bill restricting officials’ use of such markets. The story highlights rapid growth, light regulation, and political ties of US prediction platforms. Hacker News debates whether insider information is inherent to these markets, their real-world accuracy, and their potential manipulation or intelligence value.

## Comment pulse
- Insider info seen as core edge → many say markets otherwise are gambling; — counterpoint: critics liken this to insider trading and ban-worthy conflicts.  
- Prediction markets as intel tools → commenters assume governments watch them and might even place deceptive bets to mislead adversaries about operations.  
- Accuracy debated → research on calibration and biases exists; some cite markets’ self-correcting incentives, while others note tech-world hype and failed forecasts.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Prediction markets blur gambling, finance, and intelligence; governance lags their geopolitical and ethical implications.  
- Impact: If insider trading rules tighten, liquidity may drop, but trust and institutional participation could improve.  
- Watch next: Track US legislation, CFTC actions, and platforms’ self-regulation on government-user bans, KYC, and surveillance cooperation.
