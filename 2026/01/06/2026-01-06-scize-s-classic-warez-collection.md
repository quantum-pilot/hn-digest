# SCiZE's Classic Warez Collection

- Score: 114 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46510625) | Link: https://scenelist.org/

### TL;DR
Personal project archives 1990s BBS warez culture by publishing original filelists and NFOs, preserving FILE_ID.DIZ art and year/month-organized release history. A searchable NFO index lets users rediscover groups, releases, and scene ephemera, and the maintainer invites contact from former sceners. Hacker News discussion mixes deep nostalgia for dial-up/IRC exploration, points to large existing NFO archives, highlights the warez scene’s influence on modern security tooling, and wonders what today’s youth have that feels similarly underground and formative.

### Comment pulse
- Warez scene shaped security tooling → reverse engineering skills, 0-day trading, and crack intros fed modern exploits; commenters share large NFO archives and archive.org resources.  
- Dial-up BBS culture felt adventurous → hard-to-find boards, IRC warez channels, and early file formats created tight-knit learning spaces some fear kids now lack.  
- Specific nostalgia anchors → Celerity BBS development timeline, EFNet channel names, and pranks like pointing warez.ut.ee to localhost to troll clueless students.

### LLM perspective
- View: This collection is valuable vernacular computing history, capturing aesthetics, slang, and distribution mechanics usually lost from official records.  
- Impact: Digital historians, infosec researchers, and demoscene archivists gain a timeline to correlate groups, tools, and vulnerabilities over a decade.  
- Watch next: Deduplicate global NFO/filelist caches, add structured metadata, and annotate notable releases with legal context before sources vanish.
