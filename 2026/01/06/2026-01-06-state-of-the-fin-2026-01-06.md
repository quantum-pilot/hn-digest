## TL;DR
Jellyfin’s first “State of the Fin” post marks its 7th anniversary and recaps a big year: the 10.11 server release with a major EF Core database refactor, ongoing bugfix and performance work, and plans to possibly jump version numbers (e.g., 12.0) with a revamped web UI and theming. Client updates span a rebranded Qt6-based Jellyfin Desktop, Android TV improvements, a more capable Xbox app with 4K/HDR, small Roku fixes, and Swiftfin 1.4 plus a clearer roadmap for Apple platforms. On HN, many describe abandoning Plex for Jellyfin over cost, ads, and product direction.

## Comment pulse
- Plex exodus → Users resent rising costs, broken sync/downloads, and “turning into Netflix,” so migrate libraries to Jellyfin for control and openness — counterpoint: Plex clients still feel more polished.
- Homelab renaissance → Jellyfin often catalyzes full self-hosted stacks (Navidrome, OCIS, Home Assistant, Proxmox, Tailscale), or conversely prompts some to simplify to plain NFS + player apps.
- Client gaps and tradeoffs → Apple TV users juggle Swiftfin, Infuse, VLC, or SMB; Jellyfin works but feature parity, stability, and polished music/download experiences still lag Plex.

## LLM perspective
- View: Jellyfin is maturing into the default choice for self-hosted media, especially as Plex optimizes for ad-supported streaming.
- Impact: NAS builders, homelabbers, and privacy-conscious households gain leverage and avoid lock-in, but must tolerate occasional rough edges and client fragmentation.
- Watch next: Swiftfin tvOS parity, Jellyfin Web vNext performance on large libraries, and whether Plex doubles down on streaming or re-invests in local media users.
