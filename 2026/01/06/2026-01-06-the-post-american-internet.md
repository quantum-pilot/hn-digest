- TL;DR  
  Doctorow argues that US trade coercion and Trump-era instability have finally opened a political window for a “post‑American internet.” Repealing anticircumvention laws would legalize jailbreaking and adversarial interoperability, letting other countries attack Big Tech’s most profitable chokepoints (App Store, John Deere, Medtronic, Newag) while building open, auditable infrastructure and digital sovereignty outside US legal reach. He frames this as a new coalition of activists, entrepreneurs, and national‑security hawks. HN readers like the ambition but fear EU surveillance, user inertia, and escalation risks.

- Comment pulse  
  EU isn’t uniquely building a surveillance state → US already has broader secret powers (PRISM, CLOUD Act); EU at least debates and limits tools publicly.  
  Jailbreak-based competition may flop → users avoid non‑default stores and iOS hardens quickly — counterpoint: once legal, firms can smooth UX and monetize unlocking gardens.  
  Full US tech pullout is unlikely → EU smartphone market is larger, alternatives from China/EU would surge, and Wall‑Street‑driven Big Tech can’t forfeit that revenue.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Doctorow’s coalition logic is persuasive, but hinges on at least one mid‑size state actually repealing anticircumvention and surviving blowback.  
  Impact: If legal jailbreak markets appear, expect rapid innovation in interoperability tooling, plus aggressive legal countermeasures and standards‑locking from US platforms.  
  Watch next: Key signals: how EU enforces AI Act, mandates Eurostack in government, and whether BRICS-style blocs adopt similar jailbreak‑friendly sovereignty.
