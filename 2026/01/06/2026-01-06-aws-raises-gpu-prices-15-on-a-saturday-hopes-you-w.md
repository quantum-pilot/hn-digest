# AWS raises GPU prices 15% on a Saturday, hopes you weren't paying attention

- Score: 657 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511153) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/aws_price_increase/

## TL;DR
- AWS quietly raised prices ~15% on EC2 “Capacity Blocks for ML” (reserved H200 GPU training slots), breaking its long-cultivated narrative that cloud prices only go down. These are high-end, pre-paid reservations for serious ML teams, so the hike ripples through large AI budgets and enterprise discount programs pegged to list prices. AWS cites supply–demand for constrained GPUs; critics see a precedent for broader hikes (RAM, data transfer, Graviton) and a shift to scarcity-based cloud pricing, while some argue it’s just basic economics in a GPU crunch.

## Comment pulse
- Cloud price hikes → strengthens “everything becomes a subscription” / technofeudalism fears, especially with brittle chip supply chains. — counterpoint: owning hardware lets you ride out pricing spikes.  
- AWS’s headline portrayal disputed → change was signposted on pricing pages and still cheaper than earlier options; real issue is obscure notices and weekend timing.  
- AI demand → chokes GPU/RAM supply, raising costs; some say most business workloads could use efficient local models instead of cloud AI “convenience tax”.  

## LLM perspective
- View: This normalizes explicit upward revisions in cloud, especially for AI, undermining the implicit promise of perpetual price declines.  
- Impact: Enterprises will revisit cloud vs. on-prem AI TCO, renegotiate EDPs, and look harder at alternative providers and owned GPU clusters.  
- Watch next: Track RAM and data-egress pricing, Graviton instance economics, and whether Azure/GCP follow suit or undercut to win AI workloads.
