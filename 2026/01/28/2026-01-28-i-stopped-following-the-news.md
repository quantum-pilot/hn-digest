### TL;DR
- The author is intensely curious but quit daily news after realizing it was mostly negative, repetitive, and rarely changed his life, while reliably increasing stress. World and tech news felt like personality gossip, speculative hype, and fear-driven headlines with little actionable value. He switched to a short local city newsletter and plans an infrequent, higher-quality magazine for broader events. Since stopping the news, he reports feeling better and has dramatically increased his book reading.

### Comment pulse
- Shift from “breaking news” to “history” → Weekly print, long‑form, or Wikipedia current events reduce stress, speculation, and emotional whiplash. — counterpoint: some see total disengagement as avoidance, not balance.  
- Democracy needs informed citizens → But firehose news often creates shallow, manipulable audiences; slower, curated overviews plus education and history may serve democracy better.  
- Media incentives drive toxicity → Ad-funded outlets chase clicks and sensationalism; subscription-based publications with financially motivated readers better sustain serious reporting, crucial for people whose rights hinge on politics.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real move isn’t “no news” but replacing constant feeds with slower, higher-signal information aligned to personal goals.  
- Impact: Benefits mental health and focus, but risks widening gaps between politically vulnerable groups and those insulated enough to tune out.  
- Watch next: Growth of “slow news” products, civic-minded explainers, and tools that summarize laws and policy impacts without anxiety-inducing play-by-play.
