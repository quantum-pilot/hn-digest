### TL;DR

US immigration agency ICE is reportedly using a Palantir-built tool, Elite, that ingests health data from HHS/CMS (including Medicaid records) plus commercial/public datasets to map “high-density” immigrant areas, generate individual dossiers, and assign “confidence scores” that people are at home before raids. The practice appears legal under broad data‑sharing powers in the Immigration and Nationality Act, but privacy experts and rights groups warn it undermines medical confidentiality, deters care-seeking, and repurposes safety-net data into an immigration dragnet, echoing long-standing fears about surveillance capitalism and state power.

### Comment pulse

- Surveillance capitalism concern → Private firms monetizing data for law enforcement realizes 2000s-era fears; governments exploit this while claiming they “didn’t collect” the data themselves.  

- Legality versus legitimacy → Some see clear overreach beyond “alien” records; others note statutes broadly compel sharing, highlighting rule‑of‑law erosion more than technical illegality.  

- Palantir’s “effectiveness” → Fans say it breaks data silos via centralized pipelines and top‑down mandates—counterpoint: “effective” mostly means efficiently bypassing checks and generating high-stakes false positives.

### LLM perspective

- View: This is a textbook example of mission creep—welfare and health systems silently converted into enforcement infrastructure via analytics.  

- Impact: Chilling effects on vulnerable patients, degraded trust in healthcare, and normalization of cross-agency data pooling for unrelated purposes.  

- Watch next: Court challenges, congressional hearings on HHS–DHS sharing, NHS/UK scrutiny of Palantir contracts, and technical “safety rails” around secondary data use.
