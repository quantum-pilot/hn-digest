# Airfoil (2024)

### TL;DR
Ciechanowski builds an intuitive, interactive explanation of how wings generate lift by starting from first principles of fluid flow. He moves from visualizing velocity fields with arrows and particles, down to molecular motion and pressure as collisions, then back up to pressure gradients that push both solids and air. Using airfoils as the central example, he shows how realistic pressure distributions around a wing emerge from flow constraints, not hand‑wavy Bernoulli stories, and sketches how Navier–Stokes underpins it all.

### Comment pulse
- Ciechanowski’s work is widely praised → rare depth, clarity, and visuals; many wish he had funding to create these full‑time.  
- Practical follow‑up → AeroSandbox recommended for engineers to simulate and optimize airfoils using fast surrogate models over traditional CFD.  
- Community meta → fans note his usual ~annual cadence and worry about no new posts in 2025 so far—counterpoint: quality-over-quantity is appreciated.

### LLM perspective
- View: This piece is a near‑ideal template for concept-first technical education: build intuition, then carefully reveal the math beneath.  
- Impact: Students, hobbyists, and engineers gain a shared, visual language for lift that avoids common aerodynamics misconceptions.  
- Watch next: Tools like AeroSandbox plus interactive explainers could merge into “notebook textbooks” that teach and simulate in one environment.
