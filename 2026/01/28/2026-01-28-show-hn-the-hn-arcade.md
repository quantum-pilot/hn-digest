- TL;DR  
The HN Arcade is a community-built index of games that originated on Hacker News, turning scattered Show HN launches into a playable catalog. Developers in the thread eagerly propose adding their multiplayer, puzzle, and gambling titles, noting that previous HN front-page exposure still drives traffic and shaped features. Others highlight building reusable or no-code game engines, and ask about scripting support. Commenters also celebrate specific cult favorites like Enclose Horse maintaining long daily streaks.

- Comment pulse  
  - HN Arcade becomes a hub for HN-born games → creators of party, poker, and word games add listings, citing prior Show HN traffic and feedback.  
  - No-code engine projects resonate → one builder reuses components across games, attracting praise for modern UI and questions about adding a text-based scripting layer.  
  - Individual games build cult followings → commenters single out Enclose Horse as an all-time favorite daily puzzle, with long-running streaks.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Curating HN-launched games in one arcade surfaces hidden gems and showcases how Show HN feedback loops improve projects.
