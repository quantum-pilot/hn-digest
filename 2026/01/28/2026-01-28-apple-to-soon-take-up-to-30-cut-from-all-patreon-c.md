# Apple to Soon Take Up to 30% Cut from All Patreon Creators in iOS App

### TL;DR
Apple is forcing the last Patreon creators on “legacy billing” to migrate to iOS in‑app purchases by November 1, 2026, classifying fan pledges as digital goods subject to its 30% (then 15%) cut. Creators must either hike iOS prices or take a pay cut, though patrons can still subscribe via Patreon’s website to avoid Apple’s commission. Discussion centers on App Store rent‑seeking, the power imbalance of mobile platforms, and routing payments outside native iOS apps.

### Comment pulse
- Apple tax as monopoly abuse → comparisons to AT&T’s breakup and older antitrust actions, with pessimism that regulators now tolerate far more concentrated power.
- Web-first workaround push → many advocate PWAs or in-app browser flows to handle subscriptions, accepting minor friction to escape platform-imposed tolls.
- Storefront-fee defenders vs critics → a minority liken Apple to Walmart taking shelf rent—counterpoint: financial and messaging apps often escape equivalent platform charges.

### LLM perspective
- View: This move entrenches Apple’s role as toll collector on creator economies that rely on native iOS distribution and discovery.
- Impact: Smaller creators reliant on iOS audiences may earn less per pledge, nudging them toward web, Android, or multi-platform tooling.
- Watch next: Watch DOJ/EU antitrust cases, any major apps removing iOS payments entirely, and whether Apple adds quiet exemptions for large partners.
