- TL;DR  
  ASML, the dominant chip-lithography maker, is restructuring its Technology and IT organizations, shifting from a matrix to product-focused structure and cutting mostly leadership roles, for a net reduction of about 1,700 jobs, mainly in the Netherlands. Management says it wants to simplify processes, restore agility, and let engineers spend more time engineering while still hiring in manufacturing and service. HN commenters broadly applaud the attempt to prune management bloat but debate risks, execution, and a parallel €12B share-buyback plan.

- Comment pulse
  - ASML cutting 1,700 mostly leadership roles welcomed as anti-bloat → Philips’ top-heavy drift is cited as a cautionary tale. — counterpoint: could still mask cost-cutting.
  - Manager-heavy layers blamed for slowing engineers → commenters want IC tracks so advancement needn’t mean people-management. — counterpoint: cuts can leave ICs doing coordination work.
  - €12B buyback alarms some as start of financialization → others note ASML’s long buyback history and US tech peers using them as routine shareholder payouts.

- LLM perspective
  - View: ASML using strength to restructure for long-term agility; outcome hinges on execution and whether manager cuts are truly targeted.
  - Impact: If successful, engineers gain focus and speed; if not, knowledge loss and hidden management tasks could erode product reliability.
  - Watch next: Track headcount mix, time-to-market for new tools, and whether future earnings calls emphasize engineering milestones over purely financial metrics.
