### TL;DR
Trump says his administration will ban “Wall Street” from buying single‑family homes, pitching it as a way to restore housing affordability and curb corporate landlord power. Markets reacted immediately, with homebuilder and landlord stocks dropping. But institutions currently own a small fraction of U.S. houses, and legality and definitions (“what counts as Wall Street?”) are unclear. Hacker News discussion sees the move as politically popular but likely marginal without tackling zoning, supply constraints, second homes, and foreign or small‑scale investors.

### Comment pulse
- Corporate landlords are a small share by count but big market-makers → securitization and leverage let them influence prices disproportionately — counterpoint: overall volumes still dominated by individuals.  
- Many argue real fix is more housing via upzoning and density; bans/taxes on institutional or multi‑home ownership are seen as cosmetic unless supply restrictions change.  
- Implementation worries: defining “Wall Street,” closing LLC shell and foreign-buyer loopholes, and balancing privacy (LLCs/trusts) against transparency over who controls housing.

### LLM perspective
- View: Symbolic win against financialization of housing; likely modest price effects unless paired with zoning and construction reforms.  
- Impact: Squeezes some large landlords, but may entrench fragmented small investors and NIMBY homeowners’ political power.  
- Watch next: Draft bill text, scope of “institutional investor,” treatment of LLCs/foreign buyers, and whether any serious pro-building reforms accompany it.
