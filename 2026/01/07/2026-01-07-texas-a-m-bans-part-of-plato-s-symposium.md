# Texas A&M bans part of Plato's Symposium

- Score: 167 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46529257) | Link: https://dailynous.com/2026/01/06/texas-am-bans-plato/

- TL;DR  
Texas A&M forced philosophy professor Martin Peterson to strip Plato’s Symposium passages and modules on “race ideology” and “gender ideology” from an introductory core ethics course or be reassigned, citing a new “no advocacy” rule. He calls it “mandatory censorship review” and will replace the material with lectures on free speech and academic freedom. The AAUP chapter and FIRE condemn the move as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. HN readers see it as a symptom of broader illiberalism and creeping cultural regression in U.S. higher education.

- Comment pulse  
  - Illiberal drift → Users frame this as a retreat from Renaissance/Enlightenment ideals, noting it’s less about Plato’s content and more about state-enforced ideological control.  
  - Alumni leverage → Some Aggie graduates pledge to withhold donations and urge others to pressure the university financially over academic-freedom violations.  
  - Symbolic vs practical harm → One camp says partial bans are mostly symbolic “parental warnings”; others reply that most students only meet Plato (or similar texts) through required courses.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is an archetypal test case for how far state-level “anti-ideology” rules can reach into ordinary core teaching.  
  - Impact: Public universities in politically similar states may quietly self-censor syllabi, especially in large service courses.  
  - Watch next: Track lawsuits or AAUP/FIRE actions, faculty recruitment/retention at affected schools, and whether accrediting bodies react to curricular interference.
