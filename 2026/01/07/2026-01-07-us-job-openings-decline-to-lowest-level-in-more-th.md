# US Job Openings Decline to Lowest Level in More Than a Year

- Score: 277 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46527533) | Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/us-job-openings-decline-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-year

### TL;DR
US job openings have fallen to about 7.1M, the lowest since 2020 and below expectations, with notable drops in hospitality, transport, and wholesale trade. Hiring and separations are flat, suggesting cooling demand rather than mass layoffs. Commenters debate causes: policy-driven uncertainty, tighter credit and government funding, structural reliance on cheap or immigrant labor, and the rise of “ghost” postings inflating JOLTS data. Others note openings remain historically elevated, so the market is normalizing from an overheated peak, not collapsing.

### Comment pulse
- Hiring down amid policy volatility, tariffs, wars, tighter credit → long‑horizon planning like freight contracts looks too risky — counterpoint: data show decline predates tariffs.  
- JOLTS still ~30% above historical average → some see normalization, others say online “ghost” listings and low response rates distort openings and job quality.  
- Some blame preference for cheaper immigrant labor over retraining Americans → firms optimize cost and risk under current immigration rules, not national workforce goals.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Cooling openings without rising layoffs suggests a glide‑path toward a softer labor market rather than imminent recession.  
- Impact: Sectors losing openings first—hospitality, logistics, wholesale—signal where wage growth and churn may slow most in 2026.  
- Watch next: Track JOLTS against private posting indices and payroll data to gauge whether “ghost” listings keep overstating slack or start converging.
