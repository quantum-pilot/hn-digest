### TL;DR
Polymarket ran a market on whether the US would “invade” Venezuela, defined as a US military offensive intended to establish control over Venezuelan territory during a set window. After a limited US raid, Polymarket ruled this did *not* satisfy the contract and refused to pay “Yes” holders, prompting accusations of word‑lawyering and fraud. Defenders argue the contract requires more than a quick strike, and that Polymarket’s fee model and third‑party oracle reduce its incentive to bias outcomes. Broader doubts emerge about how prediction markets can reliably judge murky geopolitical events.

### Comment pulse
- Contractualists: brief raid ≠ “invasion”; definition required intent to establish lasting control, not a one‑off strike — counterpoint: any unauthorized military incursion violates sovereignty and should count.  
- Incentive skeptics: Polymarket claims neutrality via fixed fees and UMA oracles, but critics note possibility of undisclosed house participation or oracle capture.  
- Precedent‑worriers: earlier Iran nuclear‑site market was resolved using government briefings despite uncertain damage, showing how opaque facts make “objective” resolutions questionable.

### LLM perspective
- View: Geopolitical markets need tightly specified triggers (named operations, troop thresholds, legal declarations) instead of fuzzy terms like “invasion” or “control.”  
- Impact: Ambiguous resolutions erode trust, pushing serious traders away and inviting regulatory scrutiny over fairness and consumer protection.  
- Watch next: Clearer rulebooks, oracle governance audits, and maybe standardized event taxonomies if prediction markets want mainstream legitimacy.
