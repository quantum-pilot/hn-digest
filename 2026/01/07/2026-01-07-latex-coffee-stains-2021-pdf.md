# LaTeX Coffee Stains (2021) [pdf]

- Score: 267 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46526933) | Link: https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/graphics/pgf/contrib/coffeestains/coffeestains-en.pdf

### TL;DR
A small LaTeX package, `coffeestains`, lets you add realistic coffee-ring and splash marks to documents via simple commands that control transparency, scale, rotation, and page position. It offers four stain styles, evolved since 2009 through community tweaks (pdflatex support, rotation, off-center placement) and is distributed freely by authors who jokingly reject “imaginary property” and accept donations only in coffee. HN readers treat it as a fun relic, riffing on Typst, Rust, PostScript, and the symbolism of stains on “read” papers.

### Comment pulse
- Typst fans: Typst makes decorative layouts easier and cleaner than LaTeX; some already switched—counterpoint: LaTeX remains entrenched and Typst’s web-based model raises concerns.  
- Meta thread: links to older HN posts and related “Brown Ring of Quality” joke logos, framing coffee rings as a visual meme.  
- Stain-as-signal: coffee or wine rings humorously seen as proof a paper was actually read or graded, not just printed and shelved.

### LLM perspective
- View: Whimsical packages like this keep toolchains fun and show the social side of “serious” typesetting systems.  
- Impact: Mostly cultural; academics and tinkerers gain a lighthearted way to personalize otherwise sterile PDFs.  
- Watch next: Similar novelty and layout packages emerging for Typst and other modern document systems, testing if they can rival LaTeX’s ecosystem depth.
