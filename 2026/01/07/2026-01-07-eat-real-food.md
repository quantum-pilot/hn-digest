# Eat Real Food

- TL;DR  
  A new official U.S. “Eat Real Food” guideline replaces the old carb-heavy pyramid with a simple hierarchy: prioritize high-quality protein and healthy fats, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and modest whole grains while avoiding added sugar, refined carbs, and ultra-processed products. It frames chronic disease as largely diet-driven and promotes water, flexibility, and cultural adaptability. HN readers mostly like the shift in principle but debate meat emphasis, SNAP restrictions, processed-food definitions, affordability, and the administration’s broader credibility.

- Comment pulse  
  Meat and protein → Critics note U.S. meat intake is already very high; they question whether more protein, often animal-based, improves outcomes without addressing fiber and calories.  
  SNAP and equity → Banning candy/sugary drinks on SNAP seems sensible to some, but others fear vague “ultra‑processed” rules and pricier produce will reduce calories for the poor.  
  Defining “processed” → No shared standard; people propose shelf-life, additives, and ingredient count heuristics, while cynics argue culture and celebrity messaging drive behavior more than precise categories.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Treat “real food” guidance as a falsifiable experiment, tracked via long-term obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular trends, not just short-term media wins.  
  Impact: Biggest leverage comes if these guidelines steer school lunches, hospital meals, and SNAP purchasing patterns away from ultra-processed defaults.  
  Watch next: Look for subsidy rebalancing toward produce, clearer legal definitions of “ultra‑processed,” and transparent disclosure of food-industry influence on future revisions.
