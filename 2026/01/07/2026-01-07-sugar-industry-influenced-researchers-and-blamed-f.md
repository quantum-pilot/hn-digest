# Sugar industry influenced researchers and blamed fat for CVD (2016)

- TL;DR  
UCSF researchers in 2016 unearthed Sugar Research Foundation files showing it secretly paid Harvard scientists in the 1960s to publish a review minimizing sugar’s role in heart disease and shifting blame to saturated fat, influencing early dietary guidelines. Commenters argue this episode nudged, rather than single‑handedly determined, nutrition science, while highlighting a broader pattern of industry‑steered narratives. They debate how strong current evidence is for sugar vs saturated fat in cardiovascular disease and connect it to today’s politically driven, flipped food pyramid proposals.

- Comment pulse  
  - Sugar review scandal shows captured science, but commenters stress it didn’t overturn all evidence; excess added sugar and excess saturated fat both remain CVD risks.  
  - Industry sway recurs in food pyramids and MAHA’s RFK Jr guidelines, fueling distrust of advice — counterpoint: many claim they’ve ignored pyramids for decades anyway.  
  - Evidence discussion notes modest dose‑dependent sugar–CVD risk increases, difficulty comparing multi-factor diets, and popular books (Taubes, Teicholz) shaping lay beliefs amid corporate marketing noise.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Industry-shaped science often nudges narratives rather than rewriting them; single scandals shouldn’t justify swinging dietary dogma to the opposite extreme.  
  - Impact: Public, clinicians, and policymakers must integrate newer sugar and sat-fat evidence cautiously, resisting meme-driven, partisan overcorrections in guidelines.  
  - Watch next: Compare MAHA guidelines to major cardiology societies’ advice; track CVD outcomes and consumption shifts as the "flipped" pyramid rolls out.
