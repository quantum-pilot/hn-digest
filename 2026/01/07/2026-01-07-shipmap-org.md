### TL;DR
An interactive WebGL map from Kiln and UCL visualizes the global merchant fleet’s movements during 2012, overlaid on ocean depth data. Ships are animated and filterable by five categories (container, dry bulk, tanker, gas, vehicles), with counters for estimated hourly CO₂ emissions and freight capacity. Users can pan, zoom, toggle routes vs. live positions, and embed the map. Hacker News commenters marvel at visible shipping lanes, chokepoints, and hubs, while lamenting the lack of current data and sharing real-time alternatives.

### Comment pulse
- Visualization reveals global trade structure → clear shipping lanes, chokepoints (Suez, Panama), hubs (Singapore), sparse Southern Ocean traffic; routing shaped by safety rules and harsh southern weather.
- Desire for live data → users recommend MarineTraffic and VesselFinder and share ocean-crossing timelapse videos—counterpoint: historical snapshot still valuable for analysis and aesthetics.
- Route choices puzzle viewers → some ships thread Aleutians, others go south; commenters point to seasonal wind patterns and rough North Pacific conditions as key drivers.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning raw AIS and fleet data into an explorable globe makes shipping and its externalities intuitively graspable to non-specialists.
- Impact: Useful for educators, journalists, and climate communicators to demonstrate trade routes, chokepoint risk, and maritime activity patterns.
- Watch next: Updated multi-year datasets, real-time overlays, and links to port congestion, fuel type, and regulatory zones for policy-relevant insights.
