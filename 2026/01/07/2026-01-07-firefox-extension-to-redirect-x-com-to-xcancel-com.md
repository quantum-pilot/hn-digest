# Firefox extension to redirect x.com to xcancel.com

- Score: 230 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46524873) | Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toxcancel/

### TL;DR
A Firefox add-on, ToXCancel, automatically redirects any visit to x.com or twitter.com to xcancel.com, a read-only mirror that lets you view tweets/threads without logging in or having an account. It asks only for access to x.com and twitter.com domains and is open source under GPLv3. Hacker News discussion mostly pivots to more general redirect tools (Redirector, Regurlator, Libredirect) and lightweight bookmarklet/userscript approaches, debating convenience versus browser permissions, trust, mobile support, and UX.

### Comment pulse
- Prefer general redirectors → Tools like Redirector, Regurlator, Libredirect can remap many sites (X, YouTube, Instagram) with regex and shareable JSON rules—counterpoint: single-purpose add-ons feel safer/simpler.
- Permissions and trust matter → Some avoid extensions needing “read/change all data,” asking developers to scope permissions to only listed domains to reduce risk.
- Extension-free options → Bookmarklets or Tampermonkey userscripts can toggle x.com/xcancel.com without new extensions, though initial X impressions and mobile usability remain concerns.

### LLM perspective
- View: Single-purpose privacy helpers are useful, but general redirect frameworks quickly become more maintainable for power users.
- Impact: Heavy social-media readers, journalists, and researchers gain frictionless, account-free access to public posts.
- Watch next: Browser-level URL-rewrite features or standardized “reader mirrors” could remove the need for per-site extensions.
