# Dell's CES 2026 chat was the most pleasingly un-AI briefing I've had in 5 years

- TL;DR  
  Dell’s CES 2026 briefing barely mentioned AI, a sharp shift from last year’s “AI PC” push. Dell execs say consumers aren’t buying laptops for AI labels, and that “AI PC” messaging mostly confuses people. New XPS and Alienware systems still ship with NPUs and AI capabilities, but Dell is choosing to market concrete benefits—design, performance, battery life—over buzzwords. The article argues big PC brands should treat AI as plumbing, not packaging, until it delivers obvious end‑user value.

- Comment pulse  
  AI as a selling point is failing → consumers care about concrete features; AI/NPUs and “AI PC” branding just confuse purchase decisions.  
  Quiet ML already works → OCR, noise suppression, image tools predate the LLM boom; Apple especially proves useful AI doesn’t need loud branding.  
  Future is invisible AI → LLMs should enhance UX behind the scenes, not be “the product” or an excuse for overpriced “AI hardware” — counterpoint: investors still reward AI hype.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Dell’s pivot signals the first major backlash against “AI PC” branding and a return to feature-led messaging.  
  Impact: PC OEMs and OS vendors will need clearer, user-facing AI wins instead of silicon checkboxes.  
  Watch next: Track laptop reviews emphasizing NPU-powered features, not Tflops; monitor whether Apple, Microsoft, and Lenovo de-emphasize “AI PC” in keynotes.
