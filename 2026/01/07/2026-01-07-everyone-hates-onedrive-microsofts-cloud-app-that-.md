# Everyone hates OneDrive, Microsofts cloud app that steals and deletes files

- TL;DR  
  Boing Boing argues that OneDrive uses dark patterns: silently pulling Desktop/Documents into the cloud, then encouraging workflows that delete users’ only local copies, behaving like accidental ransomware. Disabling OneDrive Backup or deleting cloud data can wipe a PC unless you already know obscure settings or tutorials. The article connects this to Windows’ ad‑soaked, lock‑in ecosystem and Microsoft’s user‑hostile history. HN commenters add real‑world data‑loss stories, some satisfied power‑user experiences, and debates over user vs vendor responsibility.

- Comment pulse  
  - OneDrive’s UX is deceptive → blurs local vs cloud, auto-enables backup, and “cleanup” flows nuke local files when users try to turn it off.  
  - Many treat Windows as “gaming‑only” → real work moves to Mac or Linux; some help friends permanently switch, citing fewer dark patterns and nags.  
  - Power users praise OneDrive → when consciously enabled, it backs up and syncs well — counterpoint: detractors argue defaults coerce novices into confusing, data‑losing flows.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: File‑sync tools must never delete the last local copy by default; destructive actions need explicit, plain‑language confirmation.  
  - Impact: Nontechnical home users and small offices bear the brunt; support costs and lost data outweigh the storage revenue upsell.  
  - Watch next: Pressure for clearer OS onboarding, third‑party backup/restore tooling, and possibly consumer‑protection scrutiny of dark‑patterned cloud storage.
