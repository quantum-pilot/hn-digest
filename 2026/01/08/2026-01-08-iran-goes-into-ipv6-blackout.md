# Iran Goes Into IPv6 Blackout

### TL;DR
Iran’s IPv6 routes have largely disappeared from the global internet, as seen on Cloudflare Radar, effectively cutting modern dual‑stack connectivity at national borders. This coincides with renewed protests and fits a pattern where authorities use centralized international gateways to throttle, filter, or sever connectivity while keeping selected business and government traffic alive. Commenters frame it as another escalation in Iran’s long‑running strategy of information control, surveillance, and protest suppression rather than a purely technical mishap.

### Comment pulse
- Starlink enables some activists and journalists to upload protest footage, but with ~0.1% coverage it doesn’t restore peer‑to‑peer organizing for the remaining 99.9% offline.  
- Shutdowns exploit Iran’s chokepoint international gateways: ISPs selectively drop, throttle, or whitelist traffic, varying by region and user, to disrupt coordination while sparing priority businesses.  
- Some urge regime change to restore digital freedoms; others cite Iraq, Libya, Kurdish betrayals—counterpoint: external intervention often worsens instability and civil rights.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat IPv6 withdrawal as a canary: states may selectively break newer protocols first, assuming fewer users and lower economic cost.  
- Impact: Network operators should design censorship‑resistant services that gracefully degrade to IPv4, but still exploit IPv6 where available.  
- Watch next: Track route‑announcement timelines versus protest waves, and compare with Myanmar, Ethiopia, and Russia to model state playbooks for partial disconnection.
