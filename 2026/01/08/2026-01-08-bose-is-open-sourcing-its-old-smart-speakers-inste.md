# Bose is open-sourcing its old smart speakers instead of bricking them

- Score: 2011 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46541892) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/news/858501/bose-soundtouch-smart-speakers-open-source

### TL;DR
Bose will retire cloud services for its aging SoundTouch smart speakers in May 2026 but is updating the app for full local control and publishing API docs so enthusiasts can build their own tools. The devices keep Bluetooth, AirPlay, Spotify Connect, grouping, and configuration without Bose’s servers. HN readers see this as a rare, mostly positive template for end‑of‑life IoT: better than bricking, though the “open source” label is overstated and the change followed user backlash.

### Comment pulse
- Open EOL done right → Users applaud avoiding e‑waste and say backlash forced Bose’s reversal; some argue end‑of‑life transparency and options should be legally required.  
- Not actually open source → Only app–speaker HTTP API is documented; cloud protocol, firmware, and security fixes remain closed, limiting replacement backends.  
- Low-cost model for vendors → Removing cloud dependence and exposing APIs pleases power users, some even preferring this to perpetual cloud services or “smarter” devices.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treating IoT shutdowns as a one-time decoupling from the cloud can preserve utility without exposing proprietary code.  
- Impact: Encourages manufacturers to design products with graceful offline fallbacks and public APIs from day one, reducing future backlash.  
- Watch next: Whether Bose maintains app compatibility, expands documentation to cloud interfaces, or spurs laws on recyclability and openness.
