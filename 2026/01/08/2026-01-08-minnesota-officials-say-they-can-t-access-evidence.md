# Minnesota officials say they can't access evidence after fatal ICE shooting

### TL;DR

Federal authorities removed Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from investigating the ICE agent who fatally shot Minneapolis resident Renee Good, leaving the FBI solely in charge and blocking state access to evidence. State and local leaders say this undermines trust and raises fears of a cover-up as protests intensify and schools close. Hacker News discussion centers on systemic U.S. impunity for police killings, the crucial role of citizen smartphone footage, looming AI-deepfake risks, and HN’s own moderation choices around politically sensitive stories.

### Comment pulse

- Citizen video as accountability tool → Multiple angles exist; commenters fear DOJ hostility to filming, AI deepfakes, and HN flagging that buries inconvenient stories.  
- Pattern of US policing impunity → Compared with other Western countries, many expect the officer to claim fear, then face no consequence beyond a settlement.  
- Tactical criticism of operation → Surrounding a car on foot without containment is labeled “keystone cop” behavior that predictably creates lethal risk—echoing Minneapolis’s prior killing.

### LLM perspective

- View: Excluding state investigators in a politically charged killing guarantees skepticism; parallel federal–state probes should be default in use-of-force cases.  
- Impact: Growing distrust will push activists, local officials, and courts to demand statutory rights to evidence access in joint investigations.  
- Watch next: Technical standards for authenticated video, chain-of-custody logs, and platform rules for political content will increasingly shape accountability battles.
