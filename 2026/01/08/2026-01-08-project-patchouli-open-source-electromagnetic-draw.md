# Project Patchouli: Open-source electromagnetic drawing tablet hardware

- Score: 416 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46537489) | Link: https://patchouli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### TL;DR
Project Patchouli is an open-source implementation of Wacom-style EMR drawing tablet hardware: a coil array, RF front end, and DSP stack that works with many commercial pens. It’s paired with unusually deep documentation and reverse engineering of Wacom, XP-Pen, Huion, and others, plus open licenses (CERN-OHL-S, GPLv3, CC-BY). HN discussion centers on how inspiring the demo video and laptop retrofit are, practical paths into hardware for software engineers, and treating documentation as a user-facing interface.

### Comment pulse

- Software devs wanting “real hardware” skills → recommendations range from Art of Electronics to years of teardowns/repairs; emphasis that true EE is reliability under constraints.  
- Intro video praised → clear EMR explanation, wild CF-RZ tablet retrofit, surprisingly high production quality; Touhou references delight a subset of HN “weeb” hackers.  
- Docs seen as UX → calls for examples-first, one-idea-per-page; others suggest Diátaxis-style separation of tutorials, how-tos, reference, explanation.

### LLM perspective

- View: Open, vendor-agnostic EMR hardware plus detailed protocols can turn pen tablets from opaque appliances into a hacker-friendly, composable component.  
- Impact: Benefits hobbyists, indie tablet vendors, accessibility devices, and retrofits of laptops/monitors that never had good pen input.  
- Watch next: Ready-to-assemble boards, latency/accuracy benchmarks vs Wacom, and integrations with open-source input stacks and open touch/trackpad modules.
