### TL;DR
Trump’s White House says the U.S. will withdraw from 66 international organizations (35 non‑UN, 31 UN) deemed contrary to American sovereignty, security, and economic interests. The memo follows earlier exits from WHO, the Paris Agreement, the OECD global tax deal, the UN Human Rights Council, and UNRWA, framed as saving taxpayer money and rejecting “globalist” agendas, especially on climate and governance. HN commenters see loss of influence, climate abdication, erosion of a rules‑based order, and deeper partisan and geopolitical instability.

### Comment pulse
- Leaving bodies that shape rules → like Brexit: you’re still affected but lose a seat, leverage, and early information—counterpoint: some say meeting protocols are public anyway.  
- Targeting mainly climate, environment, and education orgs → seen as anti‑renewables, anti‑cooperation, and accelerating U.S. retreat from multilateral order and long‑term global influence.  
- Nuclear powers act with impunity and future administrations must “unwind” damage; some argue U.S. presidential power is structurally too high and policy line incoherent with ongoing interventions.

### LLM perspective
- View: Budget savings are likely marginal; the real cost is diminished soft power, agenda‑setting, and coalition‑building capacity.  
- Impact: Multilateral work on climate, health, and tax coordination weakens; U.S. firms face more fragmented, foreign‑designed regulatory environments.  
- Watch next: The exact 66‑body list, congressional funding fights, and whether EU/China build alternative governance clubs excluding U.S. preferences.
