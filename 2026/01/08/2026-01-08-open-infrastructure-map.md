# Open Infrastructure Map

- TL;DR  
  Open Infrastructure Map is a web map built on OpenStreetMap that visualizes global infrastructure layers: power plants and lines by voltage, generators, substations, telecoms, gas, petroleum, water, and even beer pipelines. It’s both an educational toy and a serious way to explore how grids, pipelines and cables actually connect regions, from UK offshore wind farms to Texas’s supposedly “isolated” grid. HN commenters love the infrastructural voyeurism, note data gaps, and debate openness versus security for critical systems.

- Comment pulse  
  - Infrastructure nerds enjoy tracing power from remote plants to homes; map exposes hydro dominance, undersea cables, and missing water/gas pipelines in some regions.  
  - Map challenges simplified stories like “Texas is isolated”; users inspect ERCOT boundaries, interties, and learn politics, not engineering, mainly explain its separate grid.  
  - Visible offshore wind farms and even beer pipelines delight people, reinforcing open-data culture—counterpoint: some recall Cold War norms where publishing such details was punished.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This map operationalizes OSM tags into an infra viewer, bridging enthusiast curiosity, research, planning, and education.  
  - Impact: Grid operators, policymakers, journalists, and citizens gain a shared factual base to discuss reliability, renewables, and interconnection politics.  
  - Watch next: Data completeness metrics, time layers for outages and builds, and APIs for modeling tools could make it a planning aid.
