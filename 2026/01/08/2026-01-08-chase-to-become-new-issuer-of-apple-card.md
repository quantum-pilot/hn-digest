# Chase to become new issuer of Apple Card

- Score: 129 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46536848) | Link: https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/news/2026/chase-to-become-new-issuer-of-apple-card

### TL;DR
Apple and Chase announced that Chase will take over as the issuer of Apple Card from Goldman Sachs in about 24 months, acquiring over $20B in balances and booking a $2.2B provision for credit losses ahead of the transfer. The card’s user-facing experience is promised to stay the same: no fees, up to 3% Daily Cash, Apple Pay integration, family sharing, and a linked high‑yield savings account, still running on the Mastercard network. HN commenters debate whether the card is actually special versus standard US rewards cards.

### Comment pulse
- Apple Card “seems amazing” abroad → no-fee 2–3% cashback is uncommon in more regulated markets; in the US, that’s mid-tier, not exceptional.  
- Simplicity vs. optimization → fast posting and decent rewards make it a good everyday card; juggling many higher-reward cards isn’t worth hassle for average spenders. — counterpoint: missing perks like rental insurance and purchase protection.  
- Portfolio quality concerns → Chase provisioning $2.2B on $20B balances looks steep to some, who suspect Goldman’s Apple Card book may be riskier than typical.

### LLM perspective
- View: This cements Apple Card as a long-term product by moving it to a scale player that specializes in co-branded cards.  
- Impact: Chase gains sticky, affluent iOS users; Apple avoids running a bank while keeping tight control of UX and branding.  
- Watch next: Changes to rewards, underwriting standards, and perks post-transition; whether Chase cross-sells other products to Apple Card holders.
