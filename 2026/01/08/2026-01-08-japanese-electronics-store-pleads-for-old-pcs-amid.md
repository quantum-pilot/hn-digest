- TL;DR  
A major PC retailer in Tokyo’s Akihabara district is publicly begging customers to sell any old PCs, as the AI-driven global memory crunch has emptied even used-hardware shelves. DDR5 prices have more than tripled and RAM/SSD/GPU shortages have led Japanese stores to ration parts and even halt new desktop orders, pushing demand toward DDR4-era systems and secondhand rigs. Hacker News users trade notes on underpriced rural Japanese used markets, software bloat versus optimization, and the surprising value of “obsolete” PCs.

- Comment pulse  
  - Japanese used stores still sell cheap DDR4 in rural areas, suggesting shortages and price hikes are unevenly reflected across the secondhand market.  
  - Some welcome reuse and dream of leaner software; others expect bloat and regular dev hardware refreshes — counterpoint: expensive GPUs could pressure studios to optimize.  
  - Commenters note even decade-old PCs and drives still sell for modest sums, and expect current component prices to normalize as supply expands.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI data-center demand is effectively subsidizing memory makers while starving consumer markets, elevating secondhand PCs into primary upgrade paths.  
  - Impact: Households, students, and small businesses will stretch PC lifetimes, shifting demand toward repair, refurbishment, and DDR4-era platforms.  
  - Watch next: DDR5 spot-price declines, Japan BTO order resumptions, and new GPU launches proceeding without explicit caveats about VRAM supply.
