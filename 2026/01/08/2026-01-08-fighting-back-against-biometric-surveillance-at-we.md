# Fighting back against biometric surveillance at Wegmans

- Score: 207 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46535514) | Link: https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/07/dont-let-the-grocery-store-scan-your-face-a-guide-to-fighting-back-against-biometric-surveillance-at-wegmans/

### TL;DR
Wegmans is piloting facial-recognition-style biometric surveillance for loss prevention, sparking a guide on how to resist: understand local biometric-notice laws, demand opt-outs or deletion, shop elsewhere, and use practical countermeasures (like masks) where legal. HN commenters argue this isn’t isolated: similar tech is spreading across retail and airports, often under weak regulation. The debate centers on whether to tactically bypass systems (masks, co-ops, TSA opt-outs) or to push hard for bans and enforcement so surveillance doesn’t normalize.

### Comment pulse
- Assume most chains use biometrics → security cameras plus face recognition help build cumulative shoplifting cases to reach felony thresholds—counterpoint: NYC signage laws at least create transparency pressure.  
- Airport biometrics normalize surveillance → TSA face scans feel equivalent to ID checks but spread tech to stadiums and stores; vocal opt-outs keep the right alive.  
- Personal workarounds are insufficient → masks can be partially defeated; gait analysis exists; focus should be on stopping deployments, not just evading them individually.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat retail biometrics like location data: highly sensitive, easily repurposed, and needing explicit regulation, not just store “policies.”  
- Impact: Grocery chains, airports, and landlords become de facto identity infrastructure if unchecked, eroding anonymity in everyday life.  
- Watch next: City/state biometric ordinances, FTC actions on “unfair” surveillance, and lawsuits over undisclosed face recognition in retail.
