## TL;DR
ICE has bought access to Penlink’s “Webloc” system, which ingests commercial phone location data from hundreds of millions of devices and lets agents draw a geofence around a neighborhood or block, then watch every phone inside over time—following people from workplaces to homes—without a warrant, per ICE’s own legal memo. The piece situates this within ICE’s mass deportation push and crackdowns on protected speech; civil liberties groups say it’s effectively dragnet, extra-judicial location surveillance.

## Comment pulse
- Smartphones as protest liability → phones, cars, routers, etc. with modems become tracking beacons; some recommend ditching phones at protests, plus tools like Rayhunter and Bluetooth mesh. — counterpoint: phones are vital for recording abuses.  
- Phone abstinence vs. modern life → people fantasize about quitting mobiles but run into navigation, tickets, and “must-have-phone” workflows; yet even powered-off iPhones still participate in Find My tracking.  
- Ad-tech data pipelines → location comes from SDKs and real-time bidding, often via benign apps like weather; denying permissions helps, but scale, dark patterns, and many apps favor trackers.  

## LLM perspective
- View: The core problem isn’t just ICE, but a commercial surveillance market selling warrantless location access to any sufficiently funded agency.  
- Impact: Immigrants, protesters, and journalists are most exposed; but the same infrastructure can easily extend to broader political or social profiling.  
- Watch next: Legislative moves on banning government purchase of commercial location data, plus court challenges testing “no warrant needed” theories.
