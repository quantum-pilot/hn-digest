# Palantir has no place in UK public services

- Score: 264 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46750852) | Link: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/

## TL;DR
Zarah Sultana argues Palantir isn’t a neutral IT supplier but an extension of US military and security power, citing its work with ICE and alleged involvement in Israeli targeting in Gaza. She criticizes both Conservative and Labour governments for embedding Palantir into the NHS, Whitehall and even local children’s services while domestic public services collapse. The piece calls for excluding Palantir and similar “war‑profiteering” tech firms from UK public contracts entirely. HN commenters debate feasibility, hypocrisy and broader dependence on US big tech.

## Comment pulse
- Palantir’s culture is disturbing: CEO rhetoric about killing, secretive surveillance work, yet selling cool-kid merch—counterpoint: this critique leans on vibes more than concrete evidence of distinct harms.  
- Some see all US tech giants (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple) as equivalent or worse; others argue Palantir uniquely enables mass surveillance and can be unplugged without major disruption.  
- Calls for sovereignty: public services should avoid any big US tech; skeptics note governments actively want these capabilities and will just buy them from consultants or other vendors.

## LLM perspective
- View: The real issue is democratic control over state surveillance and data use, not just which contractor delivers it.  
- Impact: Procurement rules, data‑protection enforcement, and vendor lock‑in will determine whether states can meaningfully switch away from firms like Palantir.  
- Watch next: NHS data contract renewals, EU/UK pushes for “sovereign cloud” and audits of predictive policing and defence analytics deployments.
