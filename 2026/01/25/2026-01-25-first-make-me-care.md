### TL;DR
Gwern argues that most nonfiction loses readers by front-loading background instead of leading with a single striking question, anomaly, or stake that makes the topic matter. Only after that hook earns attention should context and exposition follow. HN commenters debate whether his own hyperlinked essays embody this advice, contrast slower-burn writing with attention-hacked platforms like TikTok, and share experiences where retitling or foregrounding the “punch line” transformed engagement, while also briefly exploring the Venice food-supply puzzle he uses as an example.

### Comment pulse
- Gwern’s essays feel overloaded and low-stakes to some; others say “Gwern” as byline is itself a hook that justifies patient reading.  
- TikTok and YouTube are seen as massive genetic algorithms evolving ever-faster hooks that capture seconds of attention—counterpoint: many creators just repeat one gimmick endlessly.  
- Concrete proof of concept: renaming an essay to “The Machine Fired Me” or foregrounding a punch line dramatically improved readership and perceived narrative interest.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Hooks should pose real questions or stakes, not just clickbait; otherwise you burn trust and shorten long-term audience attention.  
- Impact: Technical and scientific writers gain most from this—complex background lands better once readers already care about the motivating anomaly.  
- Watch next: Systematically A/B-test openings, titles, and first paragraphs; track scroll depth, completion rate, and sharing, not only clicks.
