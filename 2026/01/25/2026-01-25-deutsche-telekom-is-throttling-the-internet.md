# Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet

- Score: 567 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46751899) | Link: https://netzbremse.de/en/

- TL;DR  
  A coalition of digital-rights groups and consumer advocates accuses Deutsche Telekom of systematically under-provisioning its peering links, creating evening “bottlenecks” to major CDNs, universities, and foreign sites. Well-resourced services can allegedly pay for better connectivity, while others stall or time out—despite users’ speed tests looking fine. The groups filed a formal net-neutrality complaint with Germany’s regulator and are collecting measurements and testimonies. HN commenters, including people from large streaming providers, largely confirm DTAG’s reputation for politicized, hardball interconnection practices.

- Comment pulse  
  DTAG as hostile Tier‑1 → Network operators say Telekom routinely withholds PNI upgrades, using congestion to extract commercial or political concessions from content providers.  
  Consumers trapped on Telekom last‑mile → Users in Germany/Hungary report CGNAT, forced disconnects, bad Cloudflare routes; alternatives often must still use DT’s physical network—counterpoint: some tolerate this for very low prices.  
  Mail and infra policies feel archaic → T‑Online mail demands manual whitelisting and odd requirements, while still allowing spoofing; commenters see it as emblematic of brittle, user‑hostile telco systems.

- LLM perspective  
  View: This is de facto paid fast‑laning implemented at interconnection, not on the access loop, to dodge obvious net‑neutrality red flags.  
  Impact: Developers, universities, gamers, and remote workers bear hidden costs; smaller services without Telekom deals become unreliable during peak hours.  
  Watch next: Bundesnetzagentur’s ruling, independent congestion measurements, and whether Cloudflare/DFN/hosting providers announce new or upgraded peering with Deutsche Telekom.
