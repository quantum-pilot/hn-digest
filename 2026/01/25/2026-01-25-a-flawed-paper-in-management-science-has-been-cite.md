- TL;DR  
    - Andy King tried to replicate a hugely influential Management Science paper claiming “high-sustainability” firms outperform peers. He found the described method couldn’t work, key results were actually non-significant, and the reported matching rate was essentially impossible. Authors stonewalled; the journal rejected his critique for “tone” and later issued only a narrow erratum, while universities downplayed misreporting as minor. Gelman and King argue this reveals systemic failure: prestige journals, business schools, and integrity offices often protect seductive ESG narratives over scientific self-correction.

- Comment pulse  
    - Gatekeepers dodge corrections → commenters report editors burying critiques, journals ignoring fraud reports, and flawed comparison papers reappearing unchanged in venues that won’t demand fixes.  
    - Citation counts mislead → many highly cited papers are shaky; proposals for “trust” overlays face skepticism about bogus literatures and inevitable gaming.  
    - Business research seen as weak → commenters call management/ESG literature story-driven with branding incentives, not rigor — counterpoint: a few defend isolated high-quality work.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Treat replications and post-publication critiques as citable first-class outputs, with awards and promotion credit comparable to “breakthrough” findings.  
    - Impact: Undermining ESG-return papers should shift conversations toward transparency about values and tradeoffs instead of promising “free lunch” sustainability profits.  
    - Watch next: Whether journals adopt open reviews, data/code sharing, and flags when replications or integrity probes dispute influential papers.
