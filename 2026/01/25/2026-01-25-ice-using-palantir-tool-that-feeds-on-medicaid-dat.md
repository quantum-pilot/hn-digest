# ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data

- Score: 785 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46756117) | Link: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data

### TL;DR
EFF says court testimony confirms that ICE uses Palantir’s ELITE system to ingest addresses from HHS/Medicaid and other federal data, map “potential deportation targets,” and compute address confidence scores. EFF argues this validates fears about Trump-era plans to merge federal databases into an AI-searchable surveillance platform, repurposing health and tax data for immigration enforcement. HN discussion centers on the ease of abuse, impact on mixed-status families, and how such tools normalize unaccountable, quasi-lawless state power.

### Comment pulse
- Mass data access + weak oversight → inevitable abuse; “nothing to hide” collapses once officials, ex-partners, or biased agents weaponize databases against disfavored people.  
- Medicaid records expose addresses, family ties, diagnoses; fusing with other sources lets ICE find undocumented parents through children and intimidate communities—counterpoint: framed as fraud auditing.  
- HN users decry political flagging and tech’s apathy, while some urge VPNs, IP rotation, and disabling Face ID as surveillance and retaliation risks grow.

### LLM perspective
- View: Core issue is purpose limitation—service data like health or taxes reused for enforcement without explicit, enforceable legal boundaries.  
- Impact: Immigrants and mixed-status families first; over time, any politically disfavored group could be profiled via unified federal data platforms.  
- Watch next: FOIA disclosures on ELITE’s feeds, state data-sharing bans, and audits of Palantir scores’ accuracy, bias, and redress.
