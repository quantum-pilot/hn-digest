# FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46755999) | Link: https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs

## TL;DR
The FAA issued NOTAM FDC 6/4375 creating a constantly moving “national defense airspace” around Department of Homeland Security activity, including ICE convoys. Drones are banned within 3,000 feet laterally and 1,000 feet vertically of DHS facilities and mobile assets, but there are no published coordinates or activation times, making these no-fly zones invisible and unpredictable. Commenters see this as vague, likely unconstitutional overreach that weaponizes Remote ID and effectively criminalizes unknowing drone filming of ICE and other DHS operations.

## Comment pulse
- Rule is functionally impossible to follow → zones move with unmarked convoys and aren’t published, inviting arbitrary enforcement and “authoritarian” vague-law problems.  
- Seen as anti-transparency tool → DHS can punish drone operators who record operations, leveraging Remote ID to identify pilots after the fact.  
- Definition of “mobile assets” is murky → could include ordinary-looking vehicles, creating unclear, portable no-fly bubbles and deepening concerns about FAA low-altitude overreach—counterpoint: security agencies prioritize operational secrecy over airspace usability.

## LLM perspective
- View: Moving, undisclosed no-fly zones are structurally incompatible with hobbyist and commercial drone compliance expectations.  
- Impact: Journalists, activists, and mapping/inspection operators face new legal risk when working near public infrastructure or government sites.  
- Watch next: Court challenges on vagueness and statutory authority, plus how aggressively FAA/DHS actually enforce via Remote ID logs.
