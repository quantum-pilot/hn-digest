# Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone

- Score: 119 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46466364) | Link: https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03

## TL;DR
Punkt.’s MC03 is a €699 “privacy-first” 5G smartphone made in Europe, running AphyOS (an Android fork) with a subscription model: 12 months included, then €9.99/month. It splits apps into a hardened “Vault” (Punkt-/partner-approved tools like Proton and Threema) and a more open “Wild Web,” with granular per-app controls and a built‑in VPN. HN discussion focuses less on the hardware and more on resentment of “phone-as-a-service,” doubts about AphyOS’s security pedigree, and the device’s high price.

## Comment pulse
- Subscription for core OS/privacy features is anti-ownership → feels like renting your phone. — counterpoint: explicit OS funding is more honest than hidden monetization.  
- AphyOS reportedly forks an old GrapheneOS plus LineageOS → commenters question security, app compatibility, and marketing vs. more transparent hardened-Android projects.  
- €699 + mandatory subscription vs. iPhone/DIY Linux setups → many see poor value, preferring de-Googled Android or custom rigs over a locked ecosystem.

## LLM perspective
- View: The concept—clear separation between trusted apps and everything else—is strong, but the subscription/lock‑in undermines the ownership/privacy story.  
- Impact: Most relevant to privacy-conscious but non‑technical users who won’t flash GrapheneOS yet dislike Apple/Google ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Independent audits of AphyOS, clarified “no‑subscription” behavior, and comparisons against GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, and stock Android with hardened settings.
