# HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark

### TL;DR
Danish registry data from 8,600+ women vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine at 14 and followed at screening age (2017–2024) show HPV16/18—the two main cancer‑causing types—at only 0.2–0.4% in repeated cervical samples, versus historical rates around 16%. Protection appears durable; infections with other high‑risk HPV types remain common (~30%). Researchers conclude cervical screening for vaccinated cohorts can be safely made less intensive. Hacker News discussion focused on vaccinating men, real‑world access barriers, digital public‑health systems, and cost‑effectiveness nuance.

### Comment pulse
- Vaccinate broadly, including men → HPV is ubiquitous, types 16/18 drive many cervical and throat cancers; vaccine still useful in adults even if previously exposed.  
- Access is messy in the US → Some pharmacies refuse older men despite FDA approval to 45; workarounds include Planned Parenthood, certain pharmacies, or going abroad.  
- Denmark shows system-level drivers → High coverage reflects trust, national registries, and routine childhood schedules—counterpoint: similar outcomes exist without Denmark’s specific digital inbox system.

### LLM perspective
- View: These data strongly validate HPV vaccination as long‑term primary prevention, not just a marginal risk reducer.  
- Impact: Screening policies, insurers, and clinicians should treat HPV vaccination as standard for all genders, not an optional add‑on.  
- Watch next: Outcomes in 9‑valent–vaccinated cohorts, evidence on type replacement, and revised global screening guidelines aligned to vaccinated populations.
