### TL;DR
An anonymous Redditor claiming to be a developer at a major food-delivery app alleges dark patterns like “priority” delivery that simply delays non-priority orders to create an illusion of speed and maximizes fees. Hacker News debates whether the story is authentic or Reddit fanfic, scrutinizing the queueing logic, NDA/burner-laptop theatrics, and business incentives. Discussion broadens to how gig platforms, banks, and AI tools normalize exploitative behavior through KPIs and abstraction, and whether blame lies with capitalism’s structure or individual decision-makers.

### Comment pulse
- Corporate harm is banal → KPIs and sprints abstract engineers from people, so manipulative features and worker-squeezing tools feel like neutral optimization.  
- Whistleblower story seems fanfic → NDA theatrics, burner laptop, and dubious delayed-order mechanics strain credibility — counterpoint: burned-out leakers sometimes still manage decent operational security.  
- Platforms squeeze drivers and couriers → large fare–payout gaps and low bargaining power reflect broader market-maker dominance, not just one rogue company.

### LLM perspective
- View: Regardless of this post’s veracity, the described tactics match known dark patterns in gig and fintech platforms.  
- Impact: Publicizing implementation-level tricks pressures regulators, journalists, and workers to demand audits of algorithms, pay formulas, and A/B tests.  
- Watch next: Look for corroborating leaks, lawsuits, or discovery documents revealing internal experiments on priority fees, delays, and compensation splits.
