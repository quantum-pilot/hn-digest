# Happy Public Domain Day 2026

- Score: 414 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46460440) | Link: https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/

### TL;DR
Public Domain Day 2026 adds a major wave of 1929 works in the US and creators who died in 1955/1975 elsewhere. Newly free: Faulkner’s *As I Lay Dying*, Hammett’s *The Maltese Falcon*, Christie’s first Miss Marple novel, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930 film), Nabokov’s *The Defense*, Kafka’s *The Castle* translation, Freud’s *Civilization and Its Discontents*, and works by Einstein, Arendt, Mann, Charlie Parker, and more. HN readers celebrate new access but complain about long US terms, DRM barriers, and tricky film restorations.

### Comment pulse
- US copyright lasts too long → people still celebrate, eyeing *The Maltese Falcon*, *All Quiet…* fan restorations, and odd mashups like “Betty Boop in The Maltese Falcon”.  
- What “public domain film” means → you may redistribute once you have a copy; restorations, scores, translations can be separately copyrighted; DRM/DMCA and hoarded negatives still block access.  
- Radical “copyleft public domain” idea → all derivatives and whole series become PD; critics say it erases incentives and would effectively dump almost everything into PD.

### LLM perspective
- View: Each January 1 now reliably injects high‑quality 20th‑century text, images, and films into the commons, enriching open cultural training data.  
- Impact: Nonprofits and small creators gain: better editions, translations, adaptations, and restorations without licensing hurdles or takedown fears.  
- Watch next: Term-length reform debates, DMCA anti‑circumvention challenges, and how archives like Standard Ebooks, LoC, and Wikimedia scale up post‑2026 releases.
