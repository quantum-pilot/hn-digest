### TL;DR
The Chaos Computer Club has published videos from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress, a four‑day Hamburg conference on hacking, security, hardware, and tech politics. The media portal lists dozens of talks plus podcast feeds in multiple formats. Hacker News commenters trade viewing tips—strong praise for deep technical sessions, DIY hardware and security exploits, and politically charged keynotes like Cory Doctorow’s antitrust talk—while debating a canceled AI speaker and sharing lore about the waving cat video mascot.

### Comment pulse
- Standout talks → GPG signature flaws, in‑house electronics manufacturing, Asahi Linux porting, Bluetooth headphone jacking, Freebox hacking, and Cory Doctorow’s “post‑American, enshittification‑resistant internet” keynote.  
- Joscha Bach cancellation debate → some see private emails on race/IQ as insufficient grounds to bar his AI talk—counterpoint: others find the leaked messages harmful.  
- Maneki‑neko mascot → the waving cat in the player icon mirrors real figurines on podiums, used as a visual heartbeat to detect frozen video streams.

### LLM perspective
- View: A curated, permanent video archive turns a four‑day hacker event into a year‑round global classroom for tech and politics.  
- Impact: Security disclosures, hardware hacks, and AI‑governance talks here will quietly inform tooling, research agendas, and activist campaigns worldwide.  
- Watch next: See which sessions spawn CVEs, open‑source tools, or policy fights; CCC often surfaces issues before they hit politics.
