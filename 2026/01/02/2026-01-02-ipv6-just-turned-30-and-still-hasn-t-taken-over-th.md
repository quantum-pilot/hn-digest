# IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world

- Score: 223 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46465327) | Link: https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/

## TL;DR

IPv6 was created 30 years ago to prevent IPv4 address exhaustion by expanding addresses from 32 to 128 bits, but its rollout stalled. NAT, bolted‑on IPv4 features, legacy hardware, training costs, and lack of backward compatibility removed most short‑term incentives to migrate. Yet IPv6 quietly underpins mobile, broadband, cloud, and large IoT networks, and in some regions carries most traffic. The future looks like a long dual‑stack era, with IPv6 adoption driven mainly by IPv4 scarcity and pricing rather than technical superiority.

## Comment pulse

- Education and culture → Many CS/networking programs barely cover IPv6; older engineers prefer familiar IPv4/NAT tricks—counterpoint: countries like France show painless deployment is possible at scale.  

- “IPv6 failed” vs design reality → Critics say 30 years without near‑universal use proves failure; others argue any IPv4+ extension would hit the same hardware and rollout barriers.  

- Patchy adoption and economics → Some enterprises see 75%+ IPv6 traffic, but hotels/VoIP/US ISPs often lack it; rising IPv4 address markets may eventually push laggards toward IPv6.

## LLM perspective

- View: IPv6 isn’t a flop, it’s an incomplete transition burdened by no‑compromise design and weak near‑term incentives.  

- Impact: Operators with strong IPv6 skills and tooling gain cost and scalability advantages as IPv4 addresses become financial assets.  

- Watch next: Cloud and ISP pricing for IPv4 vs IPv6, government mandates, and better IPv6 defaults in consumer routers will decide how far deployment goes.
