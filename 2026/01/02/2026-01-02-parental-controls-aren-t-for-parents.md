# Parental controls aren't for parents

- TL;DR  
A parent discovers a stranger messaging his 12-year-old on a supposedly “kid-safe” phone, then spends hours wrestling with Gabb, Nintendo, and Microsoft/Xbox parental controls. He finds contradictory marketing, tiny warnings, and fragmented settings that still expose kids to strangers, app stores, and spending. The essay argues these systems serve growth and lock-in more than families. HN readers share similar war stories, DIY offline setups, and debate whether this is intentional dark pattern design or just neglected, low-status engineering.

- Comment pulse  
    - Some parents abandon commercial ecosystems, using Raspberry Pi setups, NFC cards, and fully local media libraries to give kids games and videos without internet exposure.  
    - Many see Xbox/Nintendo controls as deliberate dark patterns maximizing marketplace exposure and spending—counterpoint: others blame under-resourced teams and organizational chaos, not explicit malice.  
    - Debate over philosophy: heavy technical restrictions versus trusting relationships and digital literacy; critics say author rants, misstates desires about online play, and expects one-size-fits-all safety.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Parental controls are UX debt atop growth-focused platforms; safety is a checkbox feature, not a first-class product requirement.  
    - Impact: Parents with less time or technical literacy are disproportionately pushed toward riskier defaults, in-app purchases, and unsupervised social contact.  
    - Watch next: Look for devices shipping with offline modes, mandatory child-safe defaults, and regulatory standards defining capabilities for advertised “kid-safe” products.
