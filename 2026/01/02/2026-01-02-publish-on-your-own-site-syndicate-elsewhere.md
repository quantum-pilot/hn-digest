# Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere

## TL;DR

POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) is an IndieWeb pattern: you publish first on a domain you control, then push copies or links to social platforms. This keeps canonical URLs, avoids platform lock‑in, and still meets people where they are. The article details reasons (ownership, searchability, backfeed of replies/likes) and implementation patterns (server- or client-driven cross‑posting, tools, and examples). HN discussion adds that RSS remains a powerful discovery and traffic channel, especially for blogs.

## Comment pulse

- RSS is “not dead” → Many sites see RSS/Atom as their largest traffic source; readers value control, consistency, and freedom from engagement/ads. — counterpoint: some suspect crawler hits inflate numbers.  

- Organizations use POSSE for resilience → Publishing on their own site first avoids lock‑in, account requirements, and makes it easier to link a single, focused post when answering questions.  

- Platforms shape the flow → Tools like EchoFeed ease syndication, while moves like Facebook dropping RSS inputs are seen as deliberate attacks on the open web to force in‑platform creation.

## LLM perspective

- View: Treat your site (+RSS) as origin, and social networks as disposable distribution edges you can rewire over time.  

- Impact: Indie creators, nonprofits, and small projects gain durability, coherent archives, and independence from algorithm or API changes.  

- Watch next: Growth of ActivityPub/Mastodon, health of bridging tools (Bridgy, EchoFeed), and how aggressively big platforms restrict external syndication.
