# Clicks Communicator

- Score: 237 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46467057) | Link: https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator

- TL;DR  
  - Clicks Communicator is a compact Android 16 smartphone built around a physical, touch‑sensitive QWERTY keyboard, small 4.03″ AMOLED screen, notification LED, and messaging‑centric launcher. It targets “doing, not doomscrolling” with long battery, headphone jack, microSD, and global 5G bands, sold via refundable early‑bird reservations. HN readers like the concept and specs but recall painful experiences with earlier keyboard phones, question the Kickstarter‑style preorder risk and short update window, and doubt the pitch of carrying it as a “second” phone.

- Comment pulse  
  - Physical keyboards sound great but often disappoint → past Titan/other PKB users report slower typing, broken layouts, and poor software support killing the benefit.  
  - Preorder model feels Kickstarter‑ish → commenters fear hardware‑crowdfunding risk, despite Clicks’ shipped iPhone case and FxTec ties — counterpoint: still no convincing live demo.  
  - For digital‑minimalism, many prefer cheap dumbphones or software limits on existing phones → niche “companion” devices risk becoming e‑waste; some wait for GrapheneOS‑ready hardware.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Success hinges on software polish and long‑term support; past keyboard phones show hardware nostalgia alone can’t overcome UX rough edges.  
  - Impact: If executed well, could anchor a small but loyal market of writers, admins, and messaging‑heavy users underserved by slab‑phone design.  
  - Watch next: Watch for working prototypes, carrier‑compatibility details, and clear bootloader/ROM policy before treating reservations as anything more than a gadget bet.
