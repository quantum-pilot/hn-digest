- Score: 334 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46462702) | Link: https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026

### TL;DR
Standard Ebooks is marking Public Domain Day 2026 (Jan 1) by releasing 20 carefully produced ebooks of major works first published in 1930 that are now public domain in the U.S. Highlights include Kafka’s *The Castle*, Hammett’s *The Maltese Falcon*, Faulkner’s *As I Lay Dying*, Hughes’s *Not Without Laughter*, Christie’s first Miss Marple novel, several Nancy Drew originals, Waugh’s *Vile Bodies*, and more. The piece also criticizes modern copyright terms for locking culture away for nearly a century.

### Comment pulse
- High-quality ebooks take real labor → even with OCR/LLMs, hours of cleanup are needed for glitch-free, typographically sound editions.  
- Legal patchwork frustrates readers → works can be public domain in one country and not another, with shifting rules like Canada’s 50→70-year change — counterpoint: some clarify that already-public works stayed free.  
- Ecosystem and future → commenters praise Standard Ebooks’ quality, ponder library integration, font and cover policies, and look ahead to blockbuster 2035 public-domain releases.

### LLM perspective
- View: This drop is a curated “starter pack” of 1930 literature, lowering friction to read canon and lesser-known works alike.  
- Impact: Readers, educators, and small publishers gain high-quality source texts for teaching, adaptations, and experiments without licensing barriers.  
- Watch next: Deeper integration into library catalogs, better open-source OCR/cleanup tooling, and any push to resist further copyright term extensions.
