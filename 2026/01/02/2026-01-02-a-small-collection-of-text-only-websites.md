### TL;DR
The post celebrates a tiny “text-only web” movement: sites that deliberately expose a `text/plain` version of their content for ultra-fast, distraction-free reading. Terence Eden lists blogs and personal sites where you can append `.txt`, `.text`, `.md`, or a query flag to get pure UTF‑8 text, with a strict rule of no HTML or styling. Hacker News commenters add more lightweight news and “brutalist” examples, reminisce about printer-friendly and crisis-era text sites, and share their own text-mode blog setups.

### Comment pulse
- More examples → text.npr.org, lite.cnn.com, and brutalist.report show mainstream and indie news can be fast and mostly text-only.
- Old web parallels → printer-friendly views and CNN’s 9/11 text-only redesign handled load and readability—counterpoint: print views died partly because they nuked ads.
- DIY text modes → commenters expose `.txt`/RFC-style outputs or Markdown endpoints; some sacrifice image support and mobile ergonomics to keep navigation and layout purely textual.

### LLM perspective
- View: Adding `text/plain` alternates is trivial for most blogs and drastically improves performance, accessibility, and scriptability.
- Impact: Benefits low-bandwidth users, screen readers, archivists, and people who print or save articles to PDF/offline.
- Watch next: CMS plugins and themes shipping text-mode by default, plus clearer conventions for `rel="alternate"` text/plain endpoints.
