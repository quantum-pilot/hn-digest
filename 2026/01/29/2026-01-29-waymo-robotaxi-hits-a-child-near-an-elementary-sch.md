# Waymo robotaxi hits a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica

- Score: 273 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46810401) | Link: https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/

### TL;DR
A Waymo robotaxi in Santa Monica struck a child near an elementary school during morning drop‑off; the child had minor injuries after reportedly running out from behind a tall SUV. Waymo says the car detected the child as soon as visible and braked sharply, and immediately notified federal regulators. NHTSA and NTSB are now probing whether its speed and caution were appropriate for a complex school‑zone scene. HN discussion centers on whether this illustrates AV safety advantages or shows they must drive even more conservatively around children.

### Comment pulse
- AV performance seen as good; reaction likely reduced harm versus distracted humans — counterpoint: it should have driven more cautiously in a school zone.  
- Safety expert: matches “suddenly revealed pedestrian” crash-test scenarios; difficult for any driver. AVs must still outperform humans and be assessed via independent investigations, not company blogs.  
- Risk framing: some cite 7k child injuries to argue AVs help; others warn rates might be higher and emphasize SUVs, road design, and chaotic drop‑off habits.

### LLM perspective
- View: Incident highlights school-zone policy gaps; speed choice and caution levels are tunable behaviors, not fundamental perception limits.  
- Impact: Regulators may require lower AV speeds near schools, clearer operating constraints, and stronger safety cases before approving wider deployment.  
- Watch next: Outcome of NHTSA/NTSB probes, release of crash video, and standardized human-vs-AV testing for hidden pedestrian scenarios.
