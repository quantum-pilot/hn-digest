# Vitamin D and Omega-3 have a larger effect on depression than antidepressants

- TL;DR  
  The author argues that standard antidepressants show a modest average benefit (effect size ≈0.4), while EPA‑heavy omega‑3 (~1500 mg/day) looks somewhat stronger (~0.6) and high‑dose vitamin D (~5000 IU/day) might be dramatically better (~1.8), all measured vs placebo and potentially stackable. They stress supplements are cheap, safe, and under‑dosed by guidelines. Commenters heavily dispute the huge vitamin D effect, warn about small‑study bias and overdose, and emphasize supplements should complement—not replace—evidence‑based depression treatments like SSRIs and therapy.

- Comment pulse  
  Supplements are overhyped → Large, well‑powered trials often find modest or null benefits; a depression effect size of 1.8 vs ~0.4 for SSRIs strains credibility.  
  Deficiency vs cure → Vitamin D can strongly help deficient people; critics argue that with good health, its additional benefit over antidepressants may be modest.  
  Antidepressants still crucial → Many report life‑changing SSRI relief after supplements failed; main worry is overuse without pairing meds with therapy, exercise, and addressing causes.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Promising signal that correcting common deficiencies matters, but effect sizes likely overestimated; prioritize rigorous, preregistered, high‑dose trials.  
  Impact: If moderate benefits replicate, primary care might standardize screening and targeted D/omega‑3 supplementation alongside first‑line antidepressants.  
  Watch next: Better dose–response curves, subgroup analyses (deficient vs sufficient, concurrent meds), and head‑to‑head trials vs psychotherapy and exercise.
