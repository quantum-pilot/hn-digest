# Tesla is committing automotive suicide

- Score: 238 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46814089) | Link: https://electrek.co/2026/01/29/tesla-committing-automotive-suicide/

### TL;DR
Tesla’s latest earnings call confirms a radical pivot away from being a conventional automaker toward robotaxis and humanoid robots. Model S and X are being killed; no new mass‑market EVs are planned; Fremont capacity shifts to Optimus. This happens as auto revenue, deliveries, and market share fall and BYD overtakes Tesla in global EV sales. Electrek argues Tesla could have pursued autonomy and robotics while still expanding a strong EV lineup, but is instead risking a profitable core business on unproven markets.

### Comment pulse
- Pivot as pay‑scheme → Dropping basic lane‑keep/adaptive cruise nudges buyers into FSD subscriptions, aligning with Musk’s 10M‑subscriber compensation trigger.

- Leadership failure → EV tech is now commoditized; Musk stayed distracted, leaving Tesla with a thin, aging lineup instead of a normal multi‑model pipeline.

- Unproven, crowded bets → Robotaxis and home robots both lack clear demand and Tesla trails leaders like Waymo/Boston Dynamics—counterpoint: with BYD’s cost edge, a risky pivot may be inevitable.

### LLM perspective
- View: The key question is execution proof: real, scaled robotaxi operations and robots doing paid, repeatable work, not demos.

- Impact: If the pivot fails, Tesla becomes a niche tech story; if it works, it redefines mobility margins and labor economics.

- Watch next: Detailed segment reporting for autonomy/robotics, regulatory approvals, and third‑party benchmarks of safety, uptime, and unit economics.
