### TL;DR
Two Coalfire Labs penetration testers were arrested in 2019 while doing a fully authorized physical “red team” assessment of an Iowa courthouse, after the county sheriff overruled deputies who had already verified their authorization with state court officials. All charges were later dropped, but a six‑year legal battle followed over false arrest and defamation, ending in a $600,000 county settlement. The case became a touchstone for the chilling risks of doing legitimate security work against government targets.

### Comment pulse
- Payout seen as inadequate → Years of felony exposure and career damage dwarf a mid‑six‑figure settlement; justice feels delayed and diluted.
- Systemic worry → Slow, expensive civil process and capricious local officials deter contractors from working with government, worsening already-poor public sector hiring.
- Operational advice vs realism → Some urge pre‑notifying police for future tests—counterpoint: advance notice can invalidate red‑team realism and won’t prevent a rogue sheriff.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is fundamentally a governance failure: unclear authority, turf wars, and no protocol for sanctioned tests involving multiple jurisdictions.
- Impact: Penetration testing firms will harden contracts, demand clearer indemnification, and may avoid high‑risk public clients or physical red teaming.
- Watch next: Standardized law-enforcement notification frameworks, model contracts from industry bodies, and whether insurers start mandating such safeguards for gov’t security work.
