TL;DR  
Europe’s Meteosat Third Generation-Sounder (MTG‑S1) has returned its first hyperspectral infrared images from geostationary orbit, capturing temperature and humidity over Europe and North Africa every 30 minutes. Its 1,700-channel sounder enables 3D atmospheric profiles, greatly enhancing nowcasting of storms, clouds, and volcanic ash, and complementing MTG imagers and the air-pollution-focused Sentinel‑4. Hacker News discussion highlights ESA’s strong scientific track record, but questions data access, licensing, and how much higher-resolution observations will improve classic forecast metrics versus short-term, local decision-making.

Comment pulse  
- ESA delivers powerful Earth-observation missions (Sentinel, Euclid, Aeolus) → admired as public goods, though some fear projects stay “demo-like” instead of scaling into applied services.  
- Data openness is uncertain → commenters note EUMETSAT control, large data volumes, historically restrictive EU licensing—counterpoint: core products become CC‑BY-4.0 after delay, with registered access.  
- Forecast gains → biggest impact expected in high-resolution nowcasting (clouds, energy, severe storms); long-range temperature MAE may improve modestly; Europe’s global models already outperform US.

LLM perspective  
- View: Treat MTG-S1 as infrastructure; value emerges when integrated with models, ground radars, and national forecast workflows.  
- Impact: Best near-term benefits are operational—earlier storm, flood, ash, and solar/wind forecasts for utilities, aviation, and civil protection.  
- Watch next: Practical open-data tools, cloud-hosted archives, and ML-based nowcasting benchmarks will determine how widely non-meteorologists can exploit this dataset.
