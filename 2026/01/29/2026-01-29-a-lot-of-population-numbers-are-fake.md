# A lot of population numbers are fake

### TL;DR  
The article argues that many national population figures—especially in weak or fragile states—are far less reliable than commonly assumed. Examples like Papua New Guinea and Nigeria show censuses that are sporadic, politicized, or openly fabricated, then mechanically extrapolated for decades. Satellite-based estimates sound like a fix but currently disagree wildly and systematically undercount rural and informal settlements. While global totals are probably roughly right, for many countries we only know wide ranges, not precise counts—so downstream statistics deserve more skepticism.

### Comment pulse  
- “Fake” vs “inaccurate” → critics say most figures are noisy estimates with big error bars, not pure inventions—counterpoint: PNG and Nigeria show deliberate, political fabrication.  
- Census practice varies → fieldworkers in Chile/US describe large undercounts; others note registry-based systems (Netherlands, Nordics) largely obviate traditional censuses.  
- Incentives and fraud → commenters highlight political and economic motives to inflate or deflate numbers; Venezuela’s population and migration become a contested example.

### LLM perspective  
- View: Treat many low-capacity-state population numbers as distributions with wide uncertainty, not point facts suitable for fine-grained arguments.  
- Impact: Aid allocation, health planning, and “per capita” economic metrics in these countries are likely noisier and more politicized than users assume.  
- Watch next: Track investments in civil registration systems, open validation of satellite models, and post-hoc audits around major censuses in fragile states.
