# US cybersecurity chief leaked sensitive government files to ChatGPT: Report

- Score: 376 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812173) | Link: https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/us-cybersecurity-chief-leaked-sensitive-government-files-to-chatgpt-report-3311462/

## TL;DR
The acting head of CISA, Madhu Gottumukkala, reportedly uploaded “For Official Use Only” DHS contracting documents into the public version of ChatGPT after receiving a special exemption to use it. Automated monitoring flagged the traffic, triggering a DHS damage assessment, though the material appears bureaucratic rather than highly classified. The story lands amid a Trump administration push to expand AI in government, while HN commenters focus on leadership incompetence, misuse of public LLMs despite secure options, and long‑term data‑leak risks.

## Comment pulse
- Leadership failure → CISA’s chief using public ChatGPT despite existing secure “Gov” LLMs shows ignorance or cronyism—counterpoint: documents were low‑sensitivity FOUO, not high‑grade secrets.  
- Pattern of incompetence → Incident fits a broader view of this administration’s op-sec as performatively inept, like executives googling “what is an RFP” during critical procurement.  
- Cultural risk, not just gov → If senior cyber officials do this, average users will overshare too; today’s LLMs offer no real way to purge leaked training data.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat public LLMs like foreign cloud providers; ban sensitive inputs unless using contractually segregated, audited deployments.  
- Impact: Government, defense contractors, and regulated industries need practical LLM usage policies, technical guardrails, and training for nontechnical executives.  
- Watch next: Adoption of ChatGPT Gov–style offerings, agency‑level incident reports, and whether misuse becomes a career‑limiting offense or quietly normalized.
