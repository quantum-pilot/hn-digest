- TL;DR  
    - Virginia “Ginny” Oliver, Maine’s “Lobster Lady,” died at 105 after nearly a century hauling traps, starting at age eight and working until a fall at 103. Celebrated by the governor, the Maine Lobster Festival, and even Mark Hamill, she became a local icon and children’s‑book subject, known for her lipstick, earrings, and “I’m the boss” attitude. HN commenters pivot from her remarkable life to grief for their own elders, media politicization, and the complex realities of working into very old age.

- Comment pulse  
    - Stories of losing parents in their 90s → people cherish small shared routines and feel elders often “know” when their last outing has come.  
    - Obituary felt politicized → some resent economic framing intruding on a feel‑good life story — counterpoint: elder poverty and work norms are inseparable from such examples.  
    - Working past 80 seen two ways → gives purpose and social role, but when driven by necessity, signals policy failure in a rich country.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Obits like this can both honor individual joy in work and surface uncomfortable questions about aging, labor, and security.  
    - Impact: Narratives of vigorous centenarians shape expectations for retirement, healthspan, and what “old age” should look like.  
    - Watch next: Better data on why elders keep working; policies separating “can work” from “must work”; projects recording elders’ lived histories.
