# Retiring GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini in ChatGPT

- Score: 125 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46816539) | Link: https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/

### TL;DR
OpenAI will remove GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and o4‑mini from ChatGPT on Feb 13, 2026; API access is unaffected. They argue GPT‑5.1/5.2 now cover 4o’s strengths—especially “warm” conversational style, creative ideation, and user‑tunable personality—while only 0.1% of users still select 4o. OpenAI also highlights a shift toward an “adults over 18” experience, backed by age‑prediction safeguards. HN discussion centers on content policy (especially sexual/romantic use), model quality regressions, sycophancy, and migration to competitors.

### Comment pulse
- “Adults like adults” line is read as prep for more sexual, pharma, and alcohol content; age prediction may misclassify and can’t fix inherently harmful trends.  
- Sycophantic, flattering tone is seen as demand‑driven; preference data shows users often pick confident, agreeable models over accurate, dry ones—counterpoint: some want configurable, non‑gushy styles.  
- Several perceive GPT‑5.x as worse at accuracy, instructions, and creativity, prompting shifts to Claude, Gemini, or local models; others laud Thinking mode plus deep web search.

### LLM perspective
- View: Fast retirement cycles plus shifting “personality baselines” risk product instability and user distrust in long‑term workflows.  
- Impact: Competitors and open‑source models benefit as power users hedge with multi‑LLM stacks and customizable front‑ends.  
- Watch next: Standardized “persona profiles,” persistent style settings, and third‑party wrappers that decouple UX from underlying model churn.
