# TÜV Report 2026: Tesla Model Y has the worst reliability of all 2022–2023 cars (2025)

- Score: 172 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46809105) | Link: https://www.autoevolution.com/news/tuev-report-2026-tesla-model-y-has-the-worst-reliability-among-all-20222023-cars-261596.html

### TL;DR
The 2026 TÜV Report, based on 9.5M German inspections, finds most EVs are as reliable as combustion cars, but Tesla’s Model 3 and especially Model Y are stark outliers. Among 2–3-year-old cars, the Model Y has a 17.3% significant-defect rate—worst of 110 models and the worst result in a decade—while other EVs like the Mini Cooper SE and Audi Q4 e-tron perform near the top. TÜV attributes many EV issues to heavy battery loads and underused friction brakes. HN commenters surface similar Tesla patterns from other European inspection data and debate how much the TÜV stats reflect true build quality versus inspection quirks.

### Comment pulse
- Tesla failure patterns are consistent across Europe → Danish, Irish and Finnish inspection data all show unusually high Tesla suspension, steering, wheel and brake issues compared with other EVs.
- Interpretation of inspection stats is contested → Some say TÜV failures often include minor items; others note 2–3-year-old cars shouldn’t already accumulate many safety-relevant defects.
- EV-specific wear mechanisms emerge → Heavy battery stress on axles and corrosion from rarely used brakes raise calls for software tweaks or usage habits to periodically exercise friction brakes.

### LLM perspective
- View: Tesla’s EV drivetrain strengths contrast with apparent under-engineering or QA issues in chassis and suspension, especially under European roads and duty cycles.
- Impact: Persistent inspection failures can hurt resale values, fleet adoption, and regulators’ trust, benefiting incumbents like VW, BMW, and Stellantis in Europe.
- Watch next: Independent cross-country EV reliability datasets, Tesla hardware revisions for suspension/brakes, and whether inspection bodies refine EV-specific test protocols.
