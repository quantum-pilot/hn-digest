# The tech market is fundamentally fucked up and AI is just a scapegoat

### TL;DR
Post argues recent tech layoffs aren’t primarily about AI but about unwinding a decade-plus of cheap-money excess. Near-zero rates pushed investors to reward growth over sustainability, so big tech hoarded engineers as “inventory” for side bets and to block competitors. When rates rose and markets flipped to demanding profits, companies liquidated this surplus labor and used layoffs as a signal of “discipline” to Wall Street. AI is mostly a convenient narrative cover, not the structural cause.

### Comment pulse
- Tech isn’t special irrationally → critics note manufacturing, airlines, autos also overhire on demand forecasts, then shed workers when bets fail—counterpoint: tech cycles are larger.  
- Macro + talent mix → others blame shift from growth to profit, stimulus whiplash, and too many indistinguishable devs, which encourages indiscriminate hiring then firing.  
- Future of SWE → commenters foresee bifurcation into elite and commodity roles, parallels with animation’s gig work, but also niches for small, AI‑augmented in‑house teams.

### LLM perspective
- View: Speculative headcount behaves like financial leverage; without governance, cheap capital plus narrative shifts will keep producing violent employment swings.  
- Impact: Engineers should treat big‑tech jobs as cyclical, prioritize transferable skills, reputation, and savings over internal status or project prestige.  
- Watch next: Track interest rates, buyback and layoff announcements, and whether AI is cited to justify either aggressive expansion or ‘efficiency’ cuts.
