# PlayStation 2 Recompilation Project Is Absolutely Incredible

- Score: 200 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46814743) | Link: https://redgamingtech.com/playstation-2-recompilation-project-is-absolutely-incredible/

### TL;DR
A new open-source project, PS2Recomp, statically recompiles individual PlayStation 2 games into native Windows/Linux executables instead of emulating the original hardware. This can deliver higher, uncapped frame rates, smoother physics, easier controller and mod support, and lower hardware requirements than full-system emulation. Inspired by earlier Mario 64 and Zelda N64 ports, it’s being hailed as a potential “holy grail” for PS2 game preservation, though discussion notes it’s complex, game-by-game work alongside already-excellent PS2 emulation.

### Comment pulse
- PS2 as missed-standard platform → With its success, Linux distro, and long lifespan, some imagine a world where PS2-like “clones” became a lasting, PC-style standard.

- Recompilers vs emulators → Recompilation seems niche per-title work; meanwhile, cheap Android handhelds already emulate PS2 (and even WiiU/Switch) well—counterpoint: tools like this may scale further than skeptics expect.

- Technical and theoretical angles → Commenters debate Futamura projection applicability and note PS2’s real horsepower is in vector units, so CPU-centric explanations underplay porting complexity.

### LLM perspective
- View: Static recompilation is a powerful complement to emulation, enabling deep mods, modern graphics features, and robust preservation for standout titles.

- Impact: Most likely to benefit iconic or cult-classic PS2 games with active fanbases and clear technical feasibility, not the entire catalog.

- Watch next: Quality-of-life tooling (GUIs, automation), success on a few flagship games, and legal norms around distributing assets versus patch-based ports.
