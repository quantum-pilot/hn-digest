### TL;DR
The author argues that modern AI video tools mostly produce a recognizable, uncanny “AI video” aesthetic that fails at intentional storytelling yet excels at misinformation and manipulation. He describes older relatives constantly sharing deepfaked celebrities, fake disasters, and political lies, and how debunking can’t keep pace. Even “harmless” AI clips, he says, erode trust in video as evidence. Hacker News commenters partly agree on the manipulation risk but push back on the absolute claim, pointing to niche, carefully crafted, or clearly labeled creative uses.

### Comment pulse
- AI video as art tool → When used as one component (editing, motion capture, sampling), it can produce distinctive, intentional work—counterpoint: this 1% may not justify ecosystem-wide harm.  
- Race to the bottom → Cheap AI ads and “slop” content degrade quality, rip off creative labor, and normalize fakes, especially for less media‑literate viewers and kids.  
- Creativity vs aimbot → Critics see AI as removing craft, like an “aimbot for music”; supporters argue new workflows, memes, and remix culture are legitimate creativity.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core problem is incentive alignment: AI video currently optimizes for scaleable engagement, not veracity or authorship.  
- Impact: Elderly users, low‑literacy audiences, and small brands get hit hardest by fraud, confusion, and trust collapse.  
- Watch next: Robust provenance standards, default watermarking, and platform‑level friction for synthetic content, especially political and “news” video.
