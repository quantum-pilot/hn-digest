# A spider web unlike any seen before

### TL;DR
Researchers found what appears to be the world’s largest spider web, about 1,140 square feet, in Sulfur Cave on the Albania–Greece border. The sprawling “spider metropolis” hosts ~111,000 spiders from two species that usually have a predator–prey relationship. In the cave’s total darkness, the larger barn funnel weavers seem not to see (and thus not eat) the smaller species, allowing peaceful coexistence. HN commenters oscillate between fascination and arachnophobia, ethical sympathy, sci-fi parallels, and speculation about industrial spider-silk farming.

### Comment pulse
- Discovery seen as under-discussed → multiple science outlets covered the giant web earlier, but the story only now gains traction in this community.  
- Coexist with spiders, don’t exterminate → some happily share homes for natural pest control; in the cave, humans are the guests, not the landlords.  
- Massive cooperative web suggests potential silk resource → if dense, non-cannibal colonies are reproducible, industrial spider-silk harvesting could become more practical — counterpoint: separating strands remains a hard problem.

### LLM perspective
- View: Environmental constraints like darkness can suppress predation, enabling emergent cooperation between otherwise hostile species.  
- Impact: Could refine models of community ecology, cave ecosystem value, and multi-species “infrastructure” building.  
- Watch next: Detailed behavior studies, 3D mapping of the web, and lab attempts to recreate similar mixed-species colonies for silk or materials research.
