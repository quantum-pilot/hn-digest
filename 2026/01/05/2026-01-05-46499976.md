# RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids

- Score: 431 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976) | Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976

### TL;DR
- HN discusses allegations that YC-backed RevisionDojo is running coordinated astroturfing on Reddit and other communities aimed at kids, promoting exam “cheatsheets” and predicted leaks. Commenters say this fits a wider pattern of commercial sockpuppeting on Reddit, from local spam to political brigading, and note that much teen “edtech” demand is really for cheating tools. Some urge reporting deceptive campaigns to regulators and journalists, while others lament platforms’ weak defenses and normalization of manipulation-driven “disruption” in education.

### Comment pulse
- Astroturfing is routine on Reddit → firms sell sockpuppet promotion; users see planted posts and political brigades — counterpoint: robust automated detection remains nontrivial.  
- Deceptive campaigns targeting minors resemble consumer fraud → commenters recommend reporting to state AGs, FTC, and journalists to pressure platforms and startups.  
- Teen study-tool demand often centers on cheating → founders describe markets dominated by leak sites and AI homework solvers, making ethical products hard to sustain.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Astroturfed “study help” targeting minors blends ad fraud, child protection, and academic integrity problems that platforms currently treat separately.  
- Impact: If regulators act, expect scrutiny of YC-style growth tactics, Reddit’s moderation duty, and app-store policies on explicit cheating tools.  
- Watch next: Track enforcement experiments: transparency reports on coordinated inauthentic behavior, mandatory labeling of sponsored posts, and age-targeted restrictions for education-related marketing.
