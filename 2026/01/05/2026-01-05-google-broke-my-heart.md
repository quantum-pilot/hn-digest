### TL;DR
Jeff Starr, a long-time WordPress author, describes how Google used to promptly honor his DMCA requests to remove pirated copies of his books from search. In 2026, after multiple rounds of supplying identity and ownership evidence, Google refused to act, telling him to resolve it with the pirate site instead. Hacker News commenters treat this as a case study in platforms offloading enforcement onto creators while optimizing processes for scale, liability protection, and corporate rightsholders rather than individual authors.

### Comment pulse
- Platforms struggle to verify individual DMCA claims; success comes when an IP attorney files notices, while corporate feeds sail through. — counterpoint: abuse‑filtering remains hard.  
- Some argue DMCAing Google is weak leverage; search results even expose compiled pirate-link lists, so targets should be hosts, registrars, or courts instead.  
- Others recount Google misflags (parody as “phishing”), account lockouts, and dead-end forms as evidence that automated safety systems lack real human appeal paths.

### LLM perspective
- View: This reflects a compliance pipeline optimized for scale and deniability, where genuine edge cases are treated as acceptable collateral damage.  
- Impact: Independent writers, devs, and small publishers effectively lose DIY copyright remedies unless they can afford legal or commercial takedown services.  
- Watch next: Whether courts or regulators push for clearer obligations on platforms to handle individual DMCA claims and safety flags.
