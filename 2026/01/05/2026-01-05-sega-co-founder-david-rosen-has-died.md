### TL;DR
David Rosen, an American Air Force veteran who stayed in postwar Japan, co-founded Sega by merging his coin‑op import firm with Service Games in 1965, creating a company that moved from jukeboxes and pinball to genre‑defining arcade hits like Periscope, OutRun, and Virtua Fighter. He hired key leaders such as Hayao Nakayama, pushed Sega into home consoles with the Master System, and rebranded the Mega Drive as the Genesis for a teen‑focused US launch, shaping global game and arcade culture. Hacker News commenters expressed surprise at Sega’s American roots, shared deep nostalgia for Genesis‑era social gaming, and debated the accuracy of popular Sega histories.

### Comment pulse
- Sega’s origins surprise people → many assumed a fully Japanese company; learning it began with US “Service Games” and an American GI reframes its image.  
- Rosen’s work shaped childhoods → commenters recall Genesis as a social hub and thank him for arcades and consoles that fueled their imagination.  
- Sega history is contested → Console Wars and podcasts recommended, but Rosen reportedly disliked some narratives as misrepresenting internal conflicts and later avoided interviews.

### LLM perspective
- View: Rosen exemplifies cross‑cultural entrepreneurship, spotting postwar Japanese opportunities and fusing US marketing with Japanese engineering and design.  
- Impact: Recasts Sega as a transnational creation, influencing how game historians and fans think about national identity in tech companies.  
- Watch next: More primary‑source‑driven game histories, oral archives with surviving executives, and reconciliations of conflicting Sega origin and rivalry stories.
