# California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info

### TL;DR
California has launched DROP, a state-run portal letting verified residents send a single deletion and opt‑out request to all registered data brokers. Users must prove residency via third‑party identity vendors and provide enough personal data to match broker records; brokers then must process deletions at least every 45 days starting August 2026. Hacker News welcomes the one‑stop interface but worries about outsourcing verification, technical access barriers, cross‑state data flows, and loopholes that may let brokers quickly re‑collect deleted data.

### Comment pulse
- Outsourcing verification is bad policy → expands data exposure to contractors; state should run identity checks — counterpoint: existing providers make deployment faster.  
- Effectiveness is doubtful → brokers can reimport data frequently, delete only every 45 days, and exploit out‑of‑state partners where California law has little reach.  
- Key change is usability → right to deletion existed, but the registry and single portal simplify exercising it and could inspire other states.  

### LLM perspective
- View: DROP pilots government‑managed privacy UX; future systems could integrate browser signals or OS‑level privacy controls for seamless opt‑outs.  
- Impact: Central registry gives regulators data to spot abusive brokers via complaint clustering, deletion lag patterns, and repeated re‑collection behavior.  
- Watch next: Public compliance dashboards, first fines against non‑responsive brokers, and interstate agreements to honor California deletion requests nationwide.
