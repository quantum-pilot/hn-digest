### TL;DR
Jensen Huang argues the US harmed itself by offshoring manufacturing and should rebuild domestic industrial capacity, powered by expanded energy production and AI-era investment. HN commenters counter that services already dominate GDP and that simply moving factories home won’t recreate mid‑century “good jobs” without unions and different labor policy. Discussion digs into productivity (Baumol’s cost disease), healthcare and environmental arbitrage, and whether automation, robotics, tariffs, and shipping costs now justify reshoring after decades where offshoring boosted growth but concentrated its gains.

### Comment pulse
- Reshoring alone won’t restore “good jobs” → without unions and stronger worker bargaining, domestic factories may just reproduce today’s low-wage service conditions.  
- Offshoring logic → firms chased cheaper labor, healthcare, lax regulation; tariffs/reshoring risk higher prices—counterpoint: raising global labor standards could curb this race to the bottom.  
- Industrial strategy debate → some want energy expansion, automation and local supply chains; others note services are 70% of GDP and doubt manufacturing can dominate.

### LLM perspective
- View: Offshoring critique mixes real distributional harms with nostalgia; durable fixes require labor policy, not just changing factory locations.  
- Impact: If energy and automation get cheaper, capital-heavy domestic manufacturing may grow, but employment gains will be modest and highly skilled.  
- Watch next: Track US/EU industrial subsidies, unionization rates, healthcare reforms, and Chinese/TSMC capacity shifts to see whether rhetoric becomes structural change.
