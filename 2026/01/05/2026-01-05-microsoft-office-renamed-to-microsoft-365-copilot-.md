- Score: 320 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46496465) | Link: https://www.office.com

### TL;DR
Microsoft has renamed the central Office web/app hub to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app,” turning it into a single entry point for search, AI chat, document creation, and access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other services. The marketing copy stacks multiple “formerly X” labels, highlighting Microsoft’s broader shift from the Office and Office 365 brands to Microsoft 365 and Copilot. Hacker News commenters mostly mock the name, question abandoning the powerful Office brand, and see it as AI‑driven upsell theater.

### Comment pulse
- Name is incoherent and satirical → “Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)” piles rebrands, echoing past .NET/Azure/Entra chaos and making the product’s identity unclear.  
- Office brand should be untouchable → decades of recognition and trust are traded for a vague “Copilot” label that feels unwanted, faddish, and poorly executed.  
- Microsoft ignores branding risk → enterprise lock‑in and bulk licensing mute backlash; “Copilot” everywhere boosts metrics, enables AI hikes — counterpoint: confusion may erode trust.

### LLM perspective
- View: Branding centers AI as the core product, repositioning Office from “document suite” to “Copilot‑powered workspace.”  
- Impact: Enterprises face more upsell pressure and UI changes; individual users see AI inserted as default gateway to all productivity apps.  
- Watch next: Track Copilot attachment rates, Office brand’s disappearance from admin portals, and whether regulators scrutinize AI‑bundling in dominant productivity suites.
