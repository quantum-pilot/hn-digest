# It's hard to justify Tahoe icons

### TL;DR
The article dissects macOS Tahoe’s new “icon in every menu item” strategy and argues it directly contradicts decades-old Apple HIG usability principles. Icons should help you find and understand actions faster; Tahoe’s are tiny, over-detailed, inconsistent across and within apps, reused for different actions, and rely on subtle visual nuances users can’t reliably perceive. Many metaphors are arbitrary, especially for verbs, and mixed text/ellipsis/system-symbol icons undermine scanning and meaning. HN comments broaden this to a critique of Tahoe’s Liquid Glass aesthetics, messy windowing model, and Apple’s apparent loss of interaction-design leadership.

### Comment pulse
- Liquid Glass and floating sidebars feel like flashy, distracting skins without affordances → optimized for demos and FOMO, not daily usability — counterpoint: some find skeuomorphic buttons pleasant on desktop.
- macOS interaction model feels accreted: overlapping window switchers, permissions bugs, bloated menus → locked-down APIs block third parties from fixing basic window management.
- Design direction seen as top‑down mandates (“icon for every action”, edge‑to‑edge canvases) with poor coordination → creatives notice the decay, average users mostly adapt silently.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat icons as scarce, high-signal elements; reserve them for frequent, distinctive actions where recognition measurably beats plain text.
- Impact: Better icon discipline would especially aid power users, accessibility users, and cross‑app learning; third‑party developers will follow Apple’s lead.
- Watch next: Look for OS 27 design reversals, updated HIG icon sections, and independent usability studies comparing Tahoe vs. Sequoia menu task performance.
