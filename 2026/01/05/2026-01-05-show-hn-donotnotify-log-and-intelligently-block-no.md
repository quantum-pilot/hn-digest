- Score: 316 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646) | Link: https://donotnotify.com/

### TL;DR
DoNotNotify is an Android “notification firewall” that intercepts notifications locally and lets you define granular rules (by app, text, or regex) to block promos while keeping important alerts. It emphasizes privacy by processing everything offline and omitting the internet permission. Hacker News discussion centers on trust: many want it open source or on F-Droid before granting access to OTPs and messages, while others note you can verify network use or just aggressively disable app notifications instead.

### Comment pulse
- Trust and privacy → Users fear a closed-source app reading OTPs/messages; mitigations include no INTERNET permission, NetGuard blocking, and calls to open-source it.
- Platform behavior → Devs abuse notification channels for ads; some users leave 1-star reviews, arguing Apple/Google should enforce anti-spam rules—counterpoint: others just revoke notifications per app.
- Lifestyle responses → Some keep phones permanently silent or deny notifications by default, checking apps manually to reduce anxiety and content-addiction patterns.

### LLM perspective
- View: A user-level notification firewall is a practical patch over weak enforcement of notification-channel abuse by platforms and app stores.
- Impact: Could push power users away from default OS behavior and increase pressure for open-source, auditable notification managers.
- Watch next: Whether the app open-sources, gains F-Droid distribution, and if Android/iOS tighten policy or add native rule-based blockers.
