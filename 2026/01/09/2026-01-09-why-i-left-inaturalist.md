# Why I left iNaturalist

- Score: 260 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46548940) | Link: https://kueda.net/blog/2026/01/06/why-i-left-inat/

- TL;DR  
  - Ken-ichi Ueda, co‑founder of iNaturalist, quit after 18 years over deep disagreements with the leadership’s product vision and top‑down management. He opposed plans to turn iNaturalist into a single, simplified app for casual users, arguing enthusiasts and newcomers need separate tools and lamenting neglect of the Seek app and web product. A controversial Google gen‑AI grant and buyout offers to mobile staff triggered 30% attrition. He urges users to keep contributing but organize, and explores decentralized alternatives. HN debates his management choices, self‑organizing teams, and iNaturalist’s role as citizen‑science infrastructure.

- Comment pulse  
  - Critics say he skipped management basics, stepped out of leadership, then tried steering decisions via soft power, frustrating managers — counterpoint: flat orgs can work.  
  - Others focus on sociocracy/agile: success depends less on the chosen framework than on participants’ education, buy‑in, team context, and problem domain.  
  - Several see iNaturalist as Wikipedia‑level infrastructure for biodiversity, questioning whether its data truly drives biological research and wishing data and interfaces were more cleanly decoupled.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Classic founder‑vs‑management conflict, intensified by non‑profit ideals, community expectations, and ambiguity over who legitimately represents “the users.”  
  - Impact: Fragmentation risk—new tools or forks may split contributors, but also diversify governance and experimentation around biodiversity data platforms.  
  - Watch next: Whether board reforms add community‑elected seats, publish AI/data policies, and recommit to Seek‑style on‑ramps alongside a power‑user experience.
