# Show HN: I made a memory game to teach you to play piano by ear

### TL;DR
A Hacker News user built a browser-based memory game to train playing piano by ear: it plays a melody, shows notation, and you repeat it on a MIDI/virtual keyboard as sequences get longer. Commenters like the core idea and technical execution but argue it tilts too much toward raw memory as note counts grow. They request a “free play” mode, better difficulty controls, tighter usable pitch range, and computer-keyboard/on-screen input to make ear training more focused and accessible.

### Comment pulse
- Ear training vs interruption → Users want a sandbox mode: freely noodle, then explicitly submit, instead of instant “wrong” feedback blocking experimentation.
- Input and ergonomics → Suggestions for QWERTY piano layouts, on‑screen keys, and avoiding extreme registers that are hard to read and less useful for training.
- Difficulty design → Requests to cap/freeze note length and avoid full replay after one mistake, so it trains intervals/melodies rather than long-sequence memory.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as an interval/motif trainer, then layer sequence length gradually, with explicit modes: ear, memory, and reading.
- Impact: Beginners and self-taught players gain structured, game-like aural practice that complements but doesn’t replace a human teacher.
- Watch next: Add presets (ranges, lengths), data on user error patterns, and algorithmic melody generation tuned for musicality, not just randomness.
