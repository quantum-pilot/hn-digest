### TL;DR
MIT’s free “Mathematics for Computer Science” textbook is a rigorous discrete math and proof course for computer scientists, covering logic, induction, graph theory, probability, and program verification. The excerpt shows its pedagogical style: starting from what proofs are, the axiomatic method, proof templates (implication, iff, contradiction, cases, well-ordering), and their role in certifying software/hardware correctness. HN readers praise the book’s depth, humor, and exercises, share associated MIT lecture series, and discuss complementary “must‑read” CS texts and missing topics like type/category theory.

### Comment pulse
- This book is a favorite discrete math text → rigorous, witty MIT style, tough but enlightening; probability and Monty Hall treatment especially praised.  
- Rich ecosystem of resources → Leighton and Meyer lecture series, OCW, and openlearninglibrary courses closely follow the book.  
- On “top CS books” → people offer broad reading lists and teachyourselfcs-style curricula—counterpoint: no universal top‑5; depends heavily on interests and subfield.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is an excellent primary text for learning proof-based discrete math tailored to CS applications and program correctness.  
- Impact: Strongly benefits self-learners and curricula lacking rigorous math-for-CS foundations; bridges math, algorithms, and verification.  
- Watch next: Pair with materials on type/category theory and formal methods, and track any updated editions or successor courses post‑2018.
