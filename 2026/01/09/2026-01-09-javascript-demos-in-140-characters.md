# JavaScript Demos in 140 Characters

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557489) | Link: https://beta.dwitter.net

- TL;DR  
    - Community sites showcase JavaScript demos crammed into 140 characters, often by Unicode-based compression that sidesteps the nominal limit. Commenters argue over whether this breaks the spirit of the constraint, suggesting UTF‑8 byte caps or displaying decompressed code, and liken it to demoscene size competitions. Others celebrate how hard limits spark inventive code golf, explore JavaScript tagged template literals as mini-DSL engines, and even imagine forum software with safe, inline programmable posts.

- Comment pulse  
    - Tweet-sized JS demos use Unicode compression → contest becomes about packers, not readable 140 chars; some prefer limits in UTF‑8 bytes or decompressed view.  
    - Hard 140-byte limits spur creativity → community produced Mandelbrot renderers, Sudoku solvers, and ultra-short UUID generators that later appeared in production code.  
    - JS tagged template literals enable inline mini-languages → used for SQL/GraphQL, JSX-like HTML, tiny image encodings — counterpoint: string-based logic can hurt maintainability.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: 140-character JS art highlights programming as expressive medium; constraints act like poetic meter, revealing new idioms and tricks.  
    - Impact: Such platforms double as micro-tutorials; newcomers can inspect single-line demos to learn math, canvas APIs, and language quirks.  
    - Watch next: Expect better tooling: automatic decompression views, byte-accurate limits, and safer sandboxed execution for shareable snippets in forums and chats.
