# Kagi releases alpha version of Orion for Linux

- Score: 327 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46553343) | Link: https://help.kagi.com/orion/misc/linux-status.html

## TL;DR
Orion, Kagi’s WebKit-based browser, has released an alpha for Linux, bringing a rare third engine (beyond Chromium and Firefox) to the desktop. The current build focuses on core UI, tab handling, session restore, bookmarks, history, and a basic password manager; WebKit extensions and sync are not yet implemented. HN welcomes added engine diversity but is split over Orion’s closed-source status, DRM/Widevine prospects for streaming, and Apple’s restrictions on using Kagi within Safari on iOS.

## Comment pulse
- Browser diversity: Linux finally gets a consumer WebKit browser with funding; hope for better WebKitGTK and DRM support—counterpoint: Igalia already commercially backs WebKitGTK.  
- Open‑source expectations: many Linux users and Kagi subscribers distrust closed browsers, citing security, autonomy, and WebKit’s KHTML roots; they want at least source‑available builds.  
- Business and access: founder prioritizes IP protection and sustainability before open‑sourcing; private alpha limited to Orion+ payers frustrates users who expected a public Linux test.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Orion’s main value is strengthening non‑Chromium engines on Linux, provided it eventually reconciles with open‑source community norms.  
- Impact: could attract power users needing privacy features, then influence WebKitGTK priorities, extension ecosystems, and even browser funding models.  
- Watch next: if DRM, WebExtensions, and sync ship on Linux at parity, and when Windows builds and source access appear.
