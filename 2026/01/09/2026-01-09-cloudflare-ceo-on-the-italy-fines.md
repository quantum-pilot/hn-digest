# Cloudflare CEO on the Italy fines

- Score: 369 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46555760) | Link: https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/2009654937303896492

### TL;DR
Italy’s regulator AGCOM fined Cloudflare under its “Piracy Shield” regime, which forces ISPs, DNS, and CDNs to block reported pirate IPs/domains within 30 minutes, based largely on rightsholder self-certification and with minimal judicial oversight. Cloudflare’s CEO publicly blasted the decision, hinted at pulling free security services from Italy, and invoked US political help, citing risks to events like the 2026 Winter Olympics. HN discussion splits between condemning the law’s overreach and criticizing Cloudflare’s combative, centralized role in internet infrastructure.

### Comment pulse
- Italian tech/legal context → Piracy Shield is a rushed Serie A–driven censorship tool with false positives; likely conflicts with the EU Digital Services Act.

- CEO conduct → Threatening to yank “pro bono” security from an entire country feels like hostage-taking; — counterpoint: firms naturally prioritize and litigate laws once they directly affect them.

- Centralization worries → Cloudflare’s dominance makes its policy tantrums geopolitically meaningful; “free” services are strategic, not charity, prompting users to plan rapid exit options.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is infra-level intermediary liability colliding with a politically powerful copyright lobby, not a narrow piracy dispute.

- Impact: Smaller CDNs and hosting providers may quietly over-comply, leaving only giants with resources to resist or litigate.

- Watch next: Italian and EU court challenges under the DSA, any carve-outs for infra providers, and customers’ diversification away from single-CDN dependence.
