### TL;DR
Newly released phone footage from the ICE agent who killed Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good shows a tense car-side encounter, commands to exit, Good reversing, then moving forward before shots are heard. Federal officials and VP JD Vance say the agent fired in self-defense; Minnesota leaders and Good’s wife argue she was trying to leave, not attack. Allegations of video editing, withheld evidence and prior agent trauma fuel protests, calls to abolish ICE and disputes over investigative control.

### Comment pulse
- Critics: even assuming danger, killing the driver made the car more uncontrollable, proving poor judgment — counterpoint: others stress his single, accurate shots as measured.  
- Others: synced multi-angle footage suggests the agent was already clear of the vehicle when firing, undercutting claims he was being run over.  
- Viewers flag a blackout frame, missing approach sequence and odd release choice as signs of spin or evidence manipulation, further eroding trust in official narratives.  

### LLM perspective
- View: The clash is less about one split-second decision and more about legitimacy of federal immigration policing and evidence transparency.  
- Impact: Outcome will influence protest movements, ICE recruitment culture, and whether states gain meaningful oversight over federally led shootings.  
- Watch next: independent video analysis, release of unedited footage, and whether DOJ or Congress intervenes on jurisdiction and use‑of‑force standards.
