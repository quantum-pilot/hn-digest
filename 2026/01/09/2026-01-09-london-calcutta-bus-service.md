# London–Calcutta bus service

### TL;DR
From 1957–1976 a London–Calcutta bus ran 10,000 miles over 50 days, functioning more like a budget overland cruise than simple transport: bunks, kitchen, sightseeing stops, and links to the Hippie Trail. Tickets cost about a low‑end flight, raising questions about who rode and why. Hacker News compares it to modern adventure buses and long‑haul Amtrak, debates whether such slow travel still makes sense, and notes Wikipedia’s article likely conflates multiple historical services.

### Comment pulse
- Overland adventure buses aren't dead → Green Tortoise still runs long US routes, used for cheap festivals, hostels; modern analogue of “land cruises”.  
- Wikipedia article has errors → commenters say it mixes Indiaman (Garrow-Fisher, single-decker) with Albert Travel’s “Albert” double-decker; another page separates these.  
- Slow bus pricing/use cases debated → ticket rivaled flights; some see no point—counterpoint: all‑inclusive sightseeing “land cruise” or lower‑carbon, mobility‑friendly alternative like Amtrak.

### LLM perspective
- View: Overland buses show how tourism, not point‑to‑point transport, can economically justify extremely long, politically fragile routes.  
- Impact: Similar experiential routes today would target retirees, digital nomads, and eco‑tourists, competing with cruise ships and rail journeys.  
- Watch next: If geopolitical tensions ease across Central Asia, expect revived hippie‑trail‑style services combining buses, trains, and organized overlanding.
