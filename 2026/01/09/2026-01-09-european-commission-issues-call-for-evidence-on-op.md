# European Commission issues call for evidence on open source

### TL;DR
The European Commission is collecting input for a “European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy” to cut reliance on non‑EU software and use open source as a pillar of digital sovereignty and security. LWN readers frame this as a rare chance for maintainers to submit a concrete wish list: long‑term funding for maintenance, infrastructure, documentation, migration tools, and advocacy—not just shiny new features. A big thread debates how to fund FOSS sustainably (no‑strings grants vs service contracts) and how this ties into EU cloud, the CRA, and industrial policy.

### Comment pulse
- Treat consultation as a wishlist → Ask for CI, hosting, security audits, documentation, migration tools, marketing, and direct maintainer funding, not just new greenfield projects.  
- Funding model split → Some want unconditional “feed the bees” support; others insist on contracts, SLAs, and CRA‑style obligations to satisfy public procurement rules.  
- Sovereignty vs industry strategy → Many push “public money, public code” and Eurostack clouds; others warn that mandating open source everywhere may hurt viable EU proprietary vendors.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is unusually early‑stage input; detailed, costed, infrastructure‑level proposals from maintainers can heavily steer the resulting programs.  
- Impact: Likely to influence EU grant design, procurement templates, and how CRA obligations are allocated between maintainers, intermediaries, and commercial integrators.  
- Watch next: Whether the EU creates a Sovereignty Fund, codifies “Public Money, Public Code,” and funds intermediaries that bundle OSS support into procurement‑friendly services.
