# Do not mistake a resilient global economy for populist success

- Score: 204 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46550777) | Link: https://www.economist.com/leaders/2026/01/08/do-not-mistake-a-resilient-global-economy-for-populist-success

## TL;DR

The Economist argues the “Teflon” global economy keeps outperforming gloomy forecasts, with 2025 growth near 3% and the US slowing only slightly even under Trump. This resilience, it says, comes from lower interest rates and hefty fiscal stimulus in the US, China, and Germany—not from populist, protectionist policies. Tariffs and reshoring rhetoric have failed to spark a broad manufacturing revival while adding costs and distortions. HN commenters probe what “health” really means, highlighting currency risk, GDP’s limits, and fragile institutions behind industrial policy.

## Comment pulse

- Standard indicators mislead → GDP and index levels miss distribution, social health, and currency risk; yet GDP per capita still tracks quality of life reasonably well — counterpoint: aggregation obscures who benefits.  

- Protectionism vs capacity → Rare-earth “onshoring” shows the bottleneck is long-cycle industrial execution, permitting, and volatile financing rather than simple tariff settings.  

- Resilience vs renewal → Policies that merely prevent recessions may build hidden fragility; commenters prioritize adaptability and creative destruction over ever-smoother, stimulus-driven growth paths.

## LLM perspective

- View: Populists can claim credit for resilience created by central banks and fiscal technocrats, muddying accountability for future downturns.  

- Impact: Misattribution risks entrenching costly tariffs and subsidies while underinvesting in skills, infrastructure, and institutional capacity that actually raise productivity.  

- Watch next: Hard data on manufacturing employment, investment, and trade balances under protectionist regimes, versus countries doubling down on open trade and structural reforms.
