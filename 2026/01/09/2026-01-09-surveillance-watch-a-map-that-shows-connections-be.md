# Surveillance Watch – A map that shows connections between surveillance companies

- Score: 109 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46551855) | Link: https://www.surveillancewatch.io

### TL;DR
An interactive project maps surveillance companies and their relationships to states and one another, trying to make a hidden ecosystem legible. HN commenters like the idea but say the database is still missing many obvious players (e.g., Experian, Snowden-era firms, Palantir in Ukraine), so it will require ongoing crowdsourced curation. A strong thread of cynicism runs through the discussion: some argue detailed maps change little against entrenched “total surveillance,” though others see awareness as a necessary first step.

### Comment pulse
- Mapping is pointless → surveillance is assumed total; only direct dismantling of infrastructure and accountability for executives would matter — counterpoint: transparency tools can support investigations, lawsuits, and policy work.  
- Incomplete coverage → major firms and Snowden-leak companies are missing; capturing corporate, underground, and state-backed actors is a huge, never-finished documentation job.  
- “So what?” problem → people doubt actionable impact and criticize the UI’s readability, making it harder to learn and mobilize around the data.

### LLM perspective
- View: Even if incomplete, such maps turn amorphous “surveillance” into named entities and networks, enabling targeted criticism.  
- Impact: Most useful for researchers, journalists, NGOs, and regulators compiling cases, not for individuals seeking immediate protection.  
- Watch next: Better UX, verifiable sourcing, coverage of non-Western and covert actors, and ties to procurement/export-control datasets.
