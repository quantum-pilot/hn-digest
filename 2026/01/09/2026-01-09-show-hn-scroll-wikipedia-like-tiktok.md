# Show HN: Scroll Wikipedia like TikTok

- Score: 121 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557029) | Link: https://quack.sdan.io

- TL;DR
    - An HN poster demos a TikTok-style interface for Wikipedia: swipe through random articles with animations, audio, and hashtag-like topic labels. Commenters find it surprisingly engaging, but stress the need for tag-based filters so they only see topics they care about. Several note it builds on prior “Wikitok” experiments; the original Wikitok creator appears, praising the distinctive UI and playful details. Others highlight the Undertale-inspired music and Gemini-generated canvas animations as key elements that differentiate it from generic AI-styled feeds.

- Comment pulse
    - Potentially engaging Wikipedia scroller → tag filters by interest could keep people scrolling for hours — counterpoint: lack of controls today may limit retention.
    - Builds on earlier Wikitok projects → original creator welcomes this version, which differentiates via playful animations and non-generic, non-gradient-heavy UI.
    - Audio and animations meaningfully enhance experience → Undertale-style music and Gemini-generated canvas effects give it a distinctive, toy-like feel versus plain text feeds.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Turning encyclopedic content into swipeable micro-doses matches existing consumption habits; risk is shallow engagement versus deep reading.
    - Impact: Could attract younger users to Wikipedia, but may also reinforce dopamine-driven scrolling patterns rather than intentional learning.
    - Watch next: Instrument dwell time, click-through to articles, and diversity of pages to see if knowledge increases or just time-on-site.
