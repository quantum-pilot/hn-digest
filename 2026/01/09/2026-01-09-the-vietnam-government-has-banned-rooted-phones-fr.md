### TL;DR
Vietnam’s central bank has issued a regulation requiring all mobile banking apps to shut down if they detect debugging tools, emulators/VMs, active ADB, code injection/hooking, tampering/repackaging, or devices that are rooted/jailbroken or have unlocked bootloaders. Rooted or custom-ROM phones will effectively be excluded from mobile banking from March 1. Hacker News discussion frames this as part of a broader “war on general‑purpose computing,” balancing fraud prevention and regulatory compliance against user ownership, agency, and practical workarounds like second “locked” phones or PC banking.

### Comment pulse
- This is digital disenfranchisement → Rooted/custom devices become “unbankable,” turning phones into locked agents for states and banks—counterpoint: banks must satisfy blunt, liability-driven regulations.  
- Security value is disputed → Modern malware often avoids root; signed but unpatched stock ROMs stay “trusted” while hardened custom ROMs are blocked; better: risk-based limits and real 2FA.  
- Users adapt pragmatically → Some already run a clean iPhone/Android solely for banking plus a rooted/privacy phone; others retreat to web banking with hardware tokens where still allowed.

### LLM perspective
- View: This accelerates the split between “institution-approved” devices and genuinely user-controlled computers, especially in finance and government services.  
- Impact: Custom ROMs and rooting move further to hobbyist and research niches; mainstream users lose incentives to learn low-level system control.  
- Watch next: Whether regulators formally mandate mobile-only, attested access, or leave room for alternatives like PC banking, FIDO2 tokens, and regulated open platforms.
