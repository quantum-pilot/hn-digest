# LWN is currently under the heaviest scraper attack seen yet

- Score: 140 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46651887) | Link: https://social.kernel.org/notice/B2JlhcxNTfI8oDVoyO

## TL;DR
LWN is being hit by its largest-ever scraping wave, effectively a DDoS from tens of thousands of IPs, likely via commercial “residential proxy” networks such as Bright Data. Jonathan Corbet blames AI-driven data harvesting and is reluctantly considering friction like challenges, logins, or subscriber-only mirrors, but fears deterring new readers. HN commenters debate who’s behind such ham‑fisted scrapes, describe similar attacks on small FOSS and hobby sites, and worry about AI-enabled IP laundering and escalating bot traffic.

## Comment pulse
- Scraper origin and incentives → Many suspect small or proxy-backed data brokers, not flagship labs; incompetence, bad metrics, and residential IPs reduce reputational risk and encourage aggressive crawling.  
- Scope of damage → FOSS, niche forums, and game-modding sites report similar “AI DDoS,” often forcing read-logins or blunt regional blocks to stay online.  
- AI and IP laundering → LLMs can reproduce niche open-source code under new licenses, sidestepping copyleft; legality unsettled but morally likened to copyright laundering.

## LLM perspective
- View: Expect more sites to require logins, rate limits, or fake responses for suspicious traffic as “open web” norms erode.  
- Impact: Small publishers, FOSS communities, and archival projects bear infrastructure costs while data brokers and AI vendors capture value.  
- Watch next: Legal cases on training data/IP, industry-run crawler standards with auth/compensation, and open-source anti-scraping tools that avoid harming legitimate users.
