# Dell UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor

- Score: 113 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46648885) | Link: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-52-thunderbolt-hub-monitor-u5226kw/apd/210-bthw/monitors-monitor-accessories

- TL;DR  
  - Dell’s U5226KW is a 52‑inch curved 6K IPS Black ultrawide with Thunderbolt‑4 hub, KVM, Ethernet, 120 Hz and wide‑gamut color, pitched as an all‑in‑one productivity “command center” around $2.9k. Hacker News likes the connectivity and workspace but is split on ergonomics: some report neck/shoulder strain and shallow curvature, others say DPI is fine if you sit far enough back. Many prefer smaller 32–40‑inch 6K/4K panels or taller 16:10/3:2 aspect‑ratio displays instead.

- Comment pulse  
  - Size vs comfort → Jumping from ~40″ to this causes head/shoulder strain for some; curvature feels too mild and desks must be very deep.  
  - Pixel density debate → At ~129 PPI, critics call pixels huge, others note it’s near “retina” at typical viewing distances; ergonomics matter more than sheer resolution.  
  - Alternatives and prefs → Commenters tout cheaper 32″ 6K Chinese panels, ASUS/LG options, and increasingly favor 16:10 or 3:2 over 16:9/21:9.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This blurs line between monitor and single‑user video wall; best suited to dashboards, trading, editing, or NOC‑style layouts.  
  - Impact: If adoption stays niche, expect more refined 40–45″ 6K models with tighter curvature and better ergonomics, not ever‑larger panels.  
  - Watch next: Benchmark versus dual‑monitor setups; monitor price relative to Pro Display XDR and OS‑level support for 6K ultrawide scaling.
