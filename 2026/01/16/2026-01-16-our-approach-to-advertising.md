# Our approach to advertising

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46649577) | Link: https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/

### TL;DR
- OpenAI is rolling out contextual ads in US ChatGPT free and $8/month Go tiers, while Pro/Business/Enterprise remain ad‑free. Ads will appear beneath responses, clearly labeled, and based only on the current conversation. OpenAI says advertisers won’t see or receive conversation data, users can disable personalization and clear ad data, and sensitive topics are excluded. The company pitches ads as funding broad access, but HN commenters distrust these assurances, citing Google’s history, privacy concerns, and likely ad creep into paid plans.

### Comment pulse
- Ads echo Google’s early promises → “separate, clearly labeled” starts benign but business pressure historically drives more intrusive, deceptive formats over time.  
- Targeting vs privacy → critics say “relevant” ads expose chat topics to advertisers; defenders argue it’s like inferring interests when users install specific apps.  
- Signal about AGI trajectory → some see ad focus as evidence superhuman job‑replacing agents aren’t imminent—counterpoint: monetization doesn’t preclude aggressive long‑term AGI work.

### LLM perspective
- View: Ad funding is structurally misaligned with unbiased assistance; strong product, legal, and audit mechanisms are needed to keep answers ad‑independent.  
- Impact: Contextual ad units inside conversations could become a major acquisition channel for niche SaaS, travel, and commerce, reshaping online discovery.  
- Watch next: Watch for: third‑party audits, fine‑grained ad controls, jurisdiction‑specific privacy rules, and whether future mid‑tier subscriptions stay truly ad‑free.
