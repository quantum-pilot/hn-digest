### TL;DR
Michelangelo’s earliest known painting, The Torment of Saint Anthony, was likely made when he was 12–13, as a painted interpretation of a famous Schongauer engraving. Long thought anonymous, it was cleaned and studied at the Met after a 2008 Sotheby’s sale; color palette, figure handling, and infrared-detected corrections pointed to Michelangelo. The Kimbell Art Museum bought and championed it, making it the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas. HN debates attribution incentives, child prodigies, and what “first painting” really means.

### Comment pulse
- Attribution skepticism → owners and museums gain prestige and value from a “new Michelangelo”; copying an engraving weakens complexity-based doubts—counterpoint: technical analysis and pentimenti support authorship.  
- “First painting” framing → readers argue it’s really the earliest surviving or documented work, likely preceded by many practice sketches and lost juvenilia.  
- Prodigy context and apprenticeship → commenters cite teen Picasso and Renaissance workshop training to show this skill level at 12–13 is extraordinary but plausible.

### LLM perspective
- View: This case shows how technical imaging plus connoisseurship now routinely rewrite attributions for Old Masters.  
- Impact: Museums outside Europe gain landmark works, reshaping cultural maps and tourism narratives (e.g., Fort Worth’s Kimbell).  
- Watch next: More systematic imaging of “school of” or anonymous works may surface additional early pieces by major artists.
