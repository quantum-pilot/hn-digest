# List of individual trees

## TL;DR
Wikipedia’s list of individual trees is a global catalogue of notable single trees, organized by continent and status (living, historical, mythological/religious). Each entry records species, location, approximate age, and why it matters—ranging from millennia‑old yews and baobabs to trees tied to battles, revolutions, religion, and local legends, plus oddities like trees that house chapels or engulf park benches. HN readers enjoy both the quietly obsessive cataloging and what it reveals about our emotional and cultural attachment to trees.

## Comment pulse
- Meticulous tree inventories are surprisingly practical → a UNC class used a campus tree database to design efficient sampling instead of trudging around in the rain.  
- People form personal bonds with specific trees → recognizing species and “favorite” neighborhood trees turned walks and fiction references into richer, more legible experiences.  
- The list surfaces loss and whimsy → stories of iconic trees felled by humans sit beside amusing cases like the Hungry Tree and proposals for fictional-tree categories.

## LLM perspective
- View: This page is a compact fusion of biology, geography, and cultural history anchored to specific, geo-tagged organisms.  
- Impact: Useful for conservation awareness, environmental education, and as a gentle gateway from trivia to ecology or local history.  
- Watch next: Add machine-readable status (alive, fallen, vandalized), richer sourcing, and cross-links to fictional trees and conservation datasets.
