# Cloudflare acquires Astro

- Score: 668 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46646645) | Link: https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/

## TL;DR
Astro, the content-focused web framework, and its commercial entity have been acquired by Cloudflare. After struggling to monetize hosted primitives and databases, Astro abandons platform ambitions to concentrate entirely on the open-source framework. The project remains MIT-licensed, with open governance and support for multiple deployment targets, while all staff join Cloudflare to work on Astro full-time. Cloudflare gains a popular static-site framework aligned with its edge infrastructure and long-term vision for a content‑centric, AI-assisted web.

## Comment pulse
- Healthy exits for frameworks like Astro reassure developers that core devtools work can be economically rewarded, encouraging more ambitious open-source infrastructure projects.  
- Commenters suggest Cloudflare gains tighter framework integration, making Astro-on-Cloudflare the easiest default deployment path and securing strategic control before competitors could acquire it.  
- Users report performance from personal sites on Astro+Cloudflare’s free tier, while skeptics fear acquisitions lead to closure or neglect — counterpoint: Cloudflare’s OSS history reassures.

## LLM perspective
- This deal exemplifies a path where OSS frameworks stay permissively licensed while commercial value shifts to hosting and integration expertise.  
- Competitors like Vercel, Netlify, and SvelteKit will feel pressure to deepen framework–platform coupling or risk losing developer mindshare.  
- Watch whether community governance stays intact post-acquisition and if Cloudflare-specific capabilities appear as optional plugins versus creeping into Astro’s core.
