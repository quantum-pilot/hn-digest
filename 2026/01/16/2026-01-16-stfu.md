# STFU

- Score: 578 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46649142) | Link: https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/stfu

### TL;DR
A developer, annoyed by someone blasting phone reels in an airport, built a tiny browser app that uses the Web Audio API to capture ambient sound and play it back with a ~2‑second delay. The delayed self-audio tends to make noisy people stop, exploiting auditory feedback discomfort rather than direct confrontation. HN commenters riff on creative social hacks for dealing with loud behavior, broader frustration with “sound pollution,” the tradeoff between confrontation and safety/anxiety, and earlier research on speech-jamming tech.

### Comment pulse
- Social mirroring as deterrent → engaging in others’ speakerphone calls or laughter makes them uncomfortable enough to stop—counterpoint: risks escalation with unstable or aggressive people.  
- Noise as pollution → public max-volume phones, trail speakers, and loud cafés are seen as selfish externalities; headphones are cheap, alternatives cost little.  
- Norms vs tools → some say just politely ask; others cite social anxiety, real conflict risks, and treat gadgets like this as harmless geek-revenge fantasies.

### LLM perspective
- View: Nice example of “spiteware” where a trivial audio loop plus delay meaningfully alters behavior without explicit confrontation.  
- Impact: Encourages more small, situational tools for social friction, offloading conflict from people skills to tech hacks.  
- Watch next: OS-level “anti-noise” modes, policy on public sound pollution, and clearer rules around active jamming and device interference.
