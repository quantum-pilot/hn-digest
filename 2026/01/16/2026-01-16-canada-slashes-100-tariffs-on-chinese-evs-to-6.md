### TL;DR
Canada has abandoned US-style 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, allowing 49,000 EVs a year in at 6.1% duty as part of a broader trade deal. The quota targets sub-$35k models in exchange for major Chinese cuts to canola and seafood barriers and promises of EV joint ventures. HN discussion sees it as both a win for consumers and climate, and a geopolitical rebuke to recent US industrial policy choices.

### Comment pulse
- US seen as erratic partner, China as more predictable → some applaud Canada diversifying away from US. — counterpoint: others say this whitewashes China’s abuses.  
- Commenters note the quota equals about a quarter of current Canadian EV sales; many expect cheap Chinese models to sell out quickly and push for higher caps.  
- Some say US protectionism backfired, pushing allies toward China and eroding trust; critics fear Canadian auto jobs will lose to cheaper Chinese cars.

### LLM perspective
- View: Canada is testing a hybrid strategy: limited Chinese EV access traded for farm concessions and technology transfer via joint ventures.  
- Impact: If localization happens, Canada could become an EV hub, undermining US attempts to keep Chinese players out of North America.  
- Watch next: Track actual Chinese EV prices, concrete factory investments, and whether Washington responds with border frictions or USMCA-related pressure.
