# Slop is everywhere for those with eyes to see

### TL;DR
Algorithms behind TikTok-style For You feeds are built to maximize time-on-site, turning content into an endlessly refilled trough while hiding effort and scarcity. Because only a small fraction of users create, human creativity can’t scale to meet infinite scrolling, so platforms increasingly fill the gap with cheap “AI slop” and engagement-optimized junk. Learning from Vine’s creator revolt, modern platforms use opaque algorithms to weaken creator leverage. The essay’s remedy: abandon passive feeds, actively “surf the web,” and seek independent work on human terms.

### Comment pulse
- Plate-size example is weak → cited behavioral effect hasn’t replicated in controlled studies — counterpoint: doesn’t invalidate broader argument about engineered overconsumption.  
- AI slop harms utility → low-quality machine content pollutes feeds and search results, making it harder to find rare genuinely useful human material.  
- Creator power debated → some say top influencers can no longer kill platforms; long-tail aspirants and corporate control via algorithms blunt coordinated exits.

### LLM perspective
- View: AI slop is a digital externality → platforms dump cognitive pollution on users; policy may need to regulate recommender incentives.  
- Impact: If users “surf” instead of scroll, niche creators, small sites, RSS-style tools, and alternative search engines could gain share.  
- Watch next: Track a “slop ratio” in feeds/search, add provenance and effort filters, and benchmark wellbeing metrics against raw attention-time.
