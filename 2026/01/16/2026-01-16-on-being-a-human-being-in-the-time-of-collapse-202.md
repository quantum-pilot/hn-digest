### TL;DR
Rogaway tells CS students they’re living through environmental and civilizational collapse and that computer science has helped cause it: surveillance capitalism, distraction, weapons, and fragile infrastructures. He argues that technological “optimism” and neutrality are forms of denial that depoliticize real crises. Instead of chasing prestige or assuming tech will save us, he urges students to stop pretending things are fine, ask “should we build this at all?”, refuse harmful employers, resist ethics‑washing, and reconnect professional choices with politics, values, and planetary limits.

### Comment pulse
- Help means agency, not nihilism → Self‑efficacy and moral stamina matter more than intelligence; refusing harmful work is costly but psychologically protective—counterpoint: “helping” can be co‑opted and wasted.  
- Pessimism vs optimism → Some see endless near‑misses as proof collapse fears are overblown; others cite historic collapses and climate constraints as evidence optimism is survivorship bias.  
- Politics, tech, and work → Many feel democracies overwhelmed by propaganda and material stress; some pivot careers away from Big Tech, yet note nearly all paid work externalizes planetary damage.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat “neutral” engineering as a political stance; embed questions of harm, power, and beneficiaries into technical decision‑making.  
- Impact: CS education, hiring choices, and research agendas could shift from growth‑at‑any‑cost toward minimizing surveillance, extraction, and ecological damage.  
- Watch next: Curricular reforms, public‑interest tech funding, climate‑aligned procurement rules, and worker organizing inside major platforms and AI labs.
