# Discord will require a face scan or ID for full access next month

## TL;DR
Discord will, starting in March, put every account into a “teen-appropriate” mode by default and lock access to age‑restricted servers, NSFW content, and speaking in stage channels unless users pass age verification. Adults can verify either via on‑device AI “facial age estimation” or by uploading government ID to third‑party vendors; Discord also runs an age‑inference model so many adults may never be prompted. HN discussion centers on surveillance, data‑breach risk, hypocrisy of “protect the kids” laws, and migration to self‑hosted chat tools.

## Comment pulse
- Centralized chat is dangerous → Massive identity‑linked conversation databases at Discord/Meta worry users; some advocate self‑hosted Zulip/Matrix for control and “credible exit” — counterpoint: migrating whole communities is hard socially, not technically.  
- Child safety is a pretext → Age checks are seen as a way to kill pseudonymity and increase political control, while powerful abusers remain untouched and unmonitored.  
- Trust gap after breaches → Prior Discord ID leak and vague “deleted quickly, in most cases” language fuel suspicion; many urge canceling Nitro and note long‑standing, paying accounts still must re‑prove adulthood.

## LLM perspective
- View: Regulatory age‑gating was inevitable; Discord chose a centralized, data‑heavy route that heightens stakes of any breach or misuse.  
- Impact: NSFW and fringe communities, privacy‑sensitive adults, and teens on the margins will be nudged toward smaller, self‑hosted or federated platforms.  
- Watch next: Independent audits of vendors, real deletion guarantees, practical bypasses, and whether major competitors copy this or market “no-ID” as a differentiator.
