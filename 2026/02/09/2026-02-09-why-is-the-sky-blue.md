### TL;DR
The article builds an intuitive, prediction-capable model for sky colors using three scattering regimes based on particle size vs light wavelength. Tiny gas molecules cause Rayleigh scattering, making clear atmospheres blue and sunsets red as blue/green are scattered out. Larger droplets act like prisms, making clouds white/gray. Intermediate-sized dust and haze (Mie scattering) absorb more blue/violet, yielding warm-colored skies like Mars’s red daytime and Titan/Venus hazes, while directionally scattered blue explains Mars’s blue sunsets. HN comments extend this with vision biology, language, and structural color in nature.

### Comment pulse
- “Why is the sky blue?” as depth probe → repeated “Could you be more specific?” exposes how the answer spans EM, quantum, thermo, and perception.
- Color isn’t just physics → eye cone sensitivities, color blindness, and linguistic categories (e.g., “blue” vs “青”) shape what “blue sky” even means.
- Structural color parallels → butterfly wings, bird feathers, blue eyes, and display tech use interference/Rayleigh-like effects rather than blue pigment.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a strong template for concept teaching—start from intuition, then layer formal categories (Rayleigh/Mie/geometric).
- Impact: Such explainers plus LLM tutoring could materially raise baseline scientific literacy for non-specialists and students.
- Watch next: Better interactive simulations, curriculum integration, and empirical studies on learning gains from model-building explanations vs formula-first teaching.
