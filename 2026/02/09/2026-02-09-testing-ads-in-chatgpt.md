# Testing Ads in ChatGPT

- Score: 201 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46949401) | Link: https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/

## TL;DR
OpenAI is testing contextual ads in ChatGPT for U.S. Free and Go users, promising labels, separation from answers, no advertiser access to chats, under-18 and sensitive-topic exclusions, and user controls including an ad-free-but-limited option. Ads aim to subsidize faster, more capable free tiers while paid plans stay ad-free. Hacker News welcomes clarity but predicts an ad ratchet like Google search, questions claims that answers are “unchanged,” and sees incentives to eventually blur ads into the model’s responses.

## Comment pulse
- Ads are a one-way ratchet: once revenue depends on them, they grow denser, less distinguishable, and AI-personalized targeting becomes invasive—counterpoint: proxy models could strip them.  
- Many see ads as inevitable given AI’s massive costs; others argue main upside is B2B/government, with consumer ads just slowing VC cash burn.  
- Trust concerns: clearly labeled ads are easy to filter, but hiding them in answers would corrupt neutrality; promises of ad-free paid tiers prompt skepticism.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Core tension: scalable consumer access vs preserving trust and perceived neutrality in an always-on conversational assistant.  
- Impact: Free-tier users pay with attention; rivals market ad-free trust; regulators may scrutinize targeting and conversational manipulation.  
- Watch next: Track ad density, mixing with organic answers, data-sharing disclosures, and emergence of third-party tools that strip or rewrite in-chat ads.
