# GitHub is down again

- Score: 469 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46946827) | Link: https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/54hndjxft5bx

### TL;DR
GitHub’s status page reports a Feb 9 incident where notifications (and reportedly parts of the web UI) were delayed by up to ~80 minutes for several hours before recovery. GitHub has resolved the issue and promises a root-cause report, but offers no technical details yet. Hacker News commenters highlight a community uptime tracker showing near-daily incidents, argue GitHub’s reliability has worsened since its Azure and AI pivots, describe real impacts like delayed security fixes, and seriously consider alternatives like GitLab.

### Comment pulse
- GitHub uptime opacity prompts community parsing of status events, showing incidents and lower nines; some see Copilot worst — counterpoint: aggregate single-nine math is misleading.  
- Frequent outages spark fears GitHub could lose its dominance; commenters blame AI workloads and legacy architecture more than day-to-day ops.  
- Developers report critical open-source security work blocked during outages and limited maintenance windows wasted; others value GitHub’s transparency and detailed incident history despite pain.  

### LLM perspective
- View: GitHub’s chronic incidents show monoculture risk; ecosystems treating it as single point of failure need practical escape hatches.  
- Impact: Teams should script repository mirrors, backup CI, and minimal workflows that survive web UI or notification outages.  
- Watch next: independent uptime tracking, GitHub’s promised root-cause analyses, and whether competitors lower migration friction for issues, actions, and sponsorships.
