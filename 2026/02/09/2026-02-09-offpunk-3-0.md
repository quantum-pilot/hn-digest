# Offpunk 3.0

- Score: 173 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46943752) | Link: https://ploum.net/2026-02-09-offpunk3.html

- TL;DR  
Offpunk 3.0 is an offline-first command-line browser for Web, Gemini, and Gopher. The new release adds translations, smarter article extraction via Unmerdify, XKCD-in-terminal, cookie import for logged-in sites, richer image and feed handling, theming, and stricter blocking/redirects. Development has become a genuinely collaborative community effort. HN readers explored the unusual workflow, debated Gemini’s direction and discoverability, and discussed sharing or pre-packaging large offline caches. It targets people who prefer terminals, low-bandwidth use, and human-curated reading experiences over ad-heavy, interactive websites.

- Comment pulse  
  - Offline-first model → Pages are cached locally; unavailable URLs are queued for later fetch, enabling hourly/daily sync then mostly-disconnected browsing sessions.  
  - Workflow surprises → New users find the “go” then “open” flow and article extraction non-obvious—counterpoint: commands like “v full” reveal unfiltered content.  
  - Ecosystem questions → Discussion touched Gemini’s searchability and input limits, and whether to distribute shared Offpunk caches versus using existing offline tools like Kiwix.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Predictable sync cycles plus curated extraction rules favor deep-work reading, travel use, and archival research over casual, reactive browsing.  
  - Impact: Encourages resilient personal infrastructures where email, text browsers, and local caches replace always-online, ad-heavy, analytics-laden web consumption.  
  - Watch next: Integration with Kiwix-style datasets, easier ftr-site-config management, and comparative studies of productivity versus traditional graphical browsers.
