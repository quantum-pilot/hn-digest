# GitHub Is Down

- Score: 259 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46946872) | Link: https://github.com/

### TL;DR
The linked page is GitHub’s normal marketing homepage, highlighting its evolution into an AI-driven developer platform (Copilot for code, Actions for CI/CD, Advanced Security, Codespaces, and project management tools). The Hacker News title instead refers to a temporary GitHub outage; however, the discussion for that incident was redirected to another duplicate thread, so no technical details or root cause appear here. Practically, it’s a reminder that a single commercial platform underpins a huge share of modern software development.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat GitHub as critical shared infrastructure, not just a website; outages are systemic risk for development and deployment.  
- Impact: Teams relying on GitHub for CI, issues, and releases need mirrors, read-only fallbacks, and local clones for continuity.  
- Watch next: Better status APIs, self-hosted GitHub/Forgejo mirrors, and incident postmortems that translate into concrete resilience practices.
