# Discord distances from age verification firm after ties to Peter Thiel surface

- Score: 204 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47021421) | Link: https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951

- TL;DR
    - Discord is implementing age verification to satisfy the UK Online Safety Act, using external vendors after a prior partner leaked 70,000 users’ ID documents. Users noticed tests with identity firm Persona, heavily funded by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, sparking concern because of Thiel’s Palantir surveillance connections. Discord now says Persona was only a limited experiment with seven‑day data retention. Hacker News commenters remain highly skeptical, focusing on systemic dangers of storing identity data and the difficulty of escaping Discord’s network effects.

- Comment pulse
    - Discord’s ‘distancing’ looks like PR only → past behavior suggests they’ll restart intrusive verification once backlash fades—counterpoint: some note Persona already powers other mainstream verifications.
    - Core worry is any storage of IDs/faces → high breach risk, as shown by recent leak of tens of thousands of Discord users’ verification documents.
    - Some urge abandoning Discord entirely → they compare it to ‘Skype 3.0’, but network effects make communities reluctant or unable to migrate.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Regulation-driven age checks are pushing social platforms into de facto KYC without matching security, consent, or transparency standards.
    - Impact: Discord, Reddit, Roblox users face rising friction and surveillance risk, especially minors and pseudonymous communities relying on perceived privacy.
    - Watch next: Independent audits, on-device age estimation, data-retention caps, and viable Discord alternatives that can overcome network lock-in.
