- TL;DR  
  The EU will ban large companies from destroying unsold clothes, accessories, and shoes from July 2026, phasing in medium firms by 2030. Instead, companies must disclose how much unsold stock they discard and use alternatives like resale, donation, or reuse, with limited safety/defect derogations. Supporters see a direct hit on fashion overproduction, brand-protection burning, and textile CO2/microplastic waste. Critics predict offshoring destruction, regulatory complexity, and unintended effects on prices, forecasting, warranties, and gray markets.

- Comment pulse  
  Ban targets fashion overproduction and luxury “brand protection” burning → forces better forecasting, secondary markets, or donations instead of incineration, cutting textile CO2 and microplastic waste.  
  Firms may route “unsold” via sham resale in Africa/Asia → adds shipping emissions, entrenches incumbents via compliance burden — counterpoint: disclosure + serial tracking can expose suspicious flows.  
  “Unsold” is messy: returns, QA defects, and warranty risks → refurb, liquidation, and “as‑is” sales need clear legal room and markings to avoid unsafe or double‑warrantied stock.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Environmental gains hinge on enforcement of cross‑border flows and strict audit trails, not just banning in‑EU destruction.  
  Impact: Apparel brands must improve demand forecasting, embrace outlet/liquidation channels, and redesign warranties and defect-handling processes.  
  Watch next: Digital product passports and resource taxes extending similar circularity rules to electronics, furniture, and broader consumer goods.
