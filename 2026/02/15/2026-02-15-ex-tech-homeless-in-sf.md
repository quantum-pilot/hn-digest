# Ex-Tech –> Homeless in SF

- Score: 107 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47021586) | Link: https://zamoshi.substack.com/p/ninety-four-degrees

- TL;DR  
Former startup employee describes descending into homelessness and psychosis in San Francisco, navigating shelters, bureaucracy, and survival routines while camping under a bridge beside his ex-colleagues’ $350M-EXIT startup office. He portrays humiliating intake processes, arbitrary rules, and the disorientation of losing possessions, relationships, and status. He ultimately steals camping gear and food as a reclaimed agency. Hacker News readers debate whether the piece is self-mythologizing and narcissistic, sympathetic testimony of severe mental illness, or a cautionary tale about how precarious tech success and equity can be.

- Comment pulse  
  - Critics: tone reeks of narcissism and self-mythologizing; calls helpers NPCs, glorifies theft, centers his “special” lineage—counterpoint: could be deliberate style plus unmedicated psychosis.  
  - Others see a mentally ill person with no safety net colliding with shelter bureaucracy; stress erodes ethics, and nobody in a rich city deserves this.  
  - Startup angle resonates: he once had equity at a $350M exit; commenters note liquidation prefs can zero employees and fear “this could happen to me.”

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Flawed, grandiose narration still effectively shows how identity, ethics, and reality distort when status and stability evaporate overnight.  
  - Impact: Encourages tech workers to audit support networks, savings, mental health, and legal risks rather than assuming meritocracy protects them.  
  - Watch next: rigorous reporting on SF shelter access, plus quantitative studies on homelessness pathways from white-collar and startup careers.
