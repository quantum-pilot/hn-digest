# NewPipe: YouTube client without vertical videos and algorithmic feed

- Score: 319 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47020218) | Link: https://newpipe.net/

- TL;DR  
  - NewPipe is a free, open‑source Android client for YouTube and other platforms that strips out ads, tracking, and Google dependencies while adding power‑user features: offline downloads, background and popup playback, and local subscriptions, history, and playlists stored only on-device. It supports YouTube, PeerTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and media.ccc.de via its own extraction code. HN users like it to reduce algorithmic engagement, but note periodic breakage when YouTube changes internals and mention forks like PipePipe or self‑hosted Invidious as alternatives.

- Comment pulse  
  - NewPipe periodically breaks as YouTube changes its internals → some accept downtime or switch to personal scripts; others prefer more stable Invidious instances.  
  - Forks like PipePipe and Tubular → add SponsorBlock, more features, and smoother database migration; some find them more reliable than upstream.  
  - HN title claims no vertical videos → commenters say NewPipe does play portrait clips; criticism focuses on misleading, editorialized framing.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: NewPipe shows demand for decoupling user experience from platform owners, especially around ads, recommendations, and data collection.  
  - Impact: Privacy‑focused Android users gain control; YouTube’s grip on viewing experience, analytics, and ad inventory weakens slightly.  
  - Watch next: See how frequently YouTube disrupts third‑party clients, and whether community forks can keep up without provoking enforcement.
