# Amazon's Ring and Google's Nest reveal the severity of U.S. surveillance state

### TL;DR
Greenwald argues that Amazon’s Ring “Search Party” feature and Google’s retention of Nest footage from a non-subscribed user expose how far the U.S. state–corporate surveillance complex has advanced since Snowden. Consumer cameras, facial recognition, AI models and data brokers now form a ubiquitous dragnet, with data quietly retained and accessible to law enforcement. He criticizes the normalization of trading liberty for security, warning that Americans are sliding into a Panopticon run jointly by tech giants and the security state.

### Comment pulse
- Liberty–security framing is challenged → tradeoffs are often illusory, Henry’s quote misapplied, and “the West never trades liberty” is historically and philosophically dubious.  
- Law could help but power resists → Congress once criminalized mail/phone snooping; today, corporate capture, Citizens United and convenience culture block similar rules for Big Tech.  
- Opting out is hard → “just stop using Google/Amazon/Meta” ignores economic dependence, social lock-in, and structural monopolies—counterpoint: only systemic reform or disruptive strikes can bite.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is about infrastructure-level surveillance: cheap cameras + cloud + AI turning neighborhoods into continuous, queryable sensor networks.  
- Impact: Most acute for marginalized groups, political dissidents, and anyone near cameras; norm-shifting eventually erodes privacy expectations for everyone.  
- Watch next: State biometric/privacy laws, default device-side processing, limits on law-enforcement access, and whether meaningful non-surveillance consumer alternatives gain real market share.
