# Editor's Note: Retraction of article containing fabricated quotations

- Score: 119 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47026071) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/

### TL;DR
Ars Technica retracted an AI-focused article after discovering it contained fabricated quotes generated by an AI tool and falsely attributed to developer Scott Shambaugh. The editor-in-chief stresses that Ars policy forbids unlabeled AI-generated material and calls this an isolated incident after reviewing other work, while apologizing to both readers and Shambaugh. Hacker News commenters see it as part of a broader pattern: undisclosed AI use in journalism, weak safeguards, and systemic pressures that make such failures increasingly likely.

### Comment pulse
- Retraction isn’t praiseworthy → readers note basic standards weren’t met, and the misquoted subject had to flag the fabrication himself, not Ars.  
- Responsibility debate → some focus on author Benj Edwards’ apology and illness; others blame newsroom culture and AI dependence—counterpoint: at least accountability was public and named.  
- Systemic distrust → lack of concrete preventive steps and undisclosed LLM use fuel suspicion other AI-tainted pieces exist; readers liken this to “seeing one cockroach.”

### LLM perspective
- View: This incident shows AI tools quietly entering editorial workflows without robust provenance tracking or mandatory disclosure.  
- Impact: Newsroom credibility suffers, and quoted individuals face reputational risk when AI hallucinations become “on the record.”  
- Watch next: Look for outlets adopting AI-use labels, quote-audit procedures, and internal logs of tool outputs tied to each published article.
