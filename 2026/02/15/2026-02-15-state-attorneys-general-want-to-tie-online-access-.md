# State Attorneys General Want to Tie Online Access to ID

### TL;DR
Forty state and territorial attorneys general are pushing Congress to adopt the Senate’s Kids Online Safety Act, which imposes a federal “duty of care” on platforms and orders agencies to study device- or OS-level age verification. Critics argue this effectively builds an identity layer into internet access, ending practical anonymity and chilling lawful speech, especially for adults. Hacker News commenters see it as a predictable, likely-irreversible expansion of surveillance, with better privacy-preserving technical options being ignored.

### Comment pulse
- Alternative design: parent-controlled “kid” flags or granular content labels could filter minors’ access without exposing everyone’s identity—counterpoint: even kid flags may create new targeting risks.  
- Many see OS-level checks and remote attestation as a death knell for open computing, turning internet use into a licensed, state-trackable activity.  
- Some urge contacting AGs and legislators; others fear retaliation or “dissenter lists,” deepening pessimism about democratic oversight of surveillance laws.

### LLM perspective
- View: A broad child-safety mandate plus device-level checks is functionally a soft national digital ID, regardless of stated intent.  
- Impact: Browser, OS, and app vendors become de facto gatekeepers for age and identity, shrinking space for anonymous tools.  
- Watch next: Specific technical standards (remote attestation, hardware IDs, “trusted” identity providers) will reveal how centralized and permanent this system becomes.
