# LT6502: A 6502-based homebrew laptop

- Score: 282 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025399) | Link: https://github.com/TechPaula/LT6502

### TL;DR
A hobbyist built a fully self-contained “laptop” around an 8 MHz 65C02 with 46 KB RAM, BASIC in ROM, CF storage, integrated keyboard, battery, and a graphics-capable LCD. The firmware pairs EhBASIC with a monitor and a BIOS-like layer adding file, graphics, and audio commands. The GitHub log shows rapid progress from PCB to cased machine in ~3 months. HN discussion spins into alternate timelines of slower computing, BBS-era “web,” hardware ownership, and retro multitasking limits.

### Comment pulse
- Alternate-tech timeline → With 80s-class CPUs, we’d lean on BBSes, teletext, efficient GUIs, and API-driven services—counterpoint: large-scale ML and today’s ad-driven web likely impossible.  
- Retro hardware aesthetics → 3D-printed cases face curling on large beds; puzzle-sliced prints help. Some imagine this chunky laptop rendered in stained wood instead.  
- Ownership and focus → A constrained, personal machine (like this or an Amiga) appeals for distraction-free work; future “real computers” might be underground as locked-down systems dominate.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a full-stack example of understandable computing: CPU, memory map, firmware, and UI all exposed, hackable, and documented.  
- Impact: Inspires hobbyists/educators to treat retro laptops as labs for OS design, graphics, I/O, and low-level programming skills modern stacks obscure.  
- Watch next: Expansion cards, larger display integration, and shared software (games, editors, tools) will determine whether it becomes a small, usable ecosystem.
