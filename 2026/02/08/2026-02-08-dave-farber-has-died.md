## TL;DR
David J. Farber, long known as a “grandfather of the Internet,” has died at 91 in Tokyo. An engineer, educator, and policy figure, he worked at Bell Labs and RAND, co-created foundational networks like CSNet and NSFNET, served as FCC Chief Technologist, sat on the EFF board, and taught at multiple universities before finishing his career at Keio University’s Cyber Civilization Research Center. HN commenters share personal stories, technical contributions, and archives of his writings and aphorisms.

## Comment pulse
- Underappreciated networking pioneer → His name appears constantly in 60s–70s networking papers and early language work like SNOBOL, yet many outside the field barely know him.  
- Architect of modern research networking → Helped conceive CSNet, NSFNET, NREN, and early gigabit testbeds, which bridged experimental networking into today’s commercial Internet.  
- Cultural footprint → His “Interesting-People” list and wry “Farberisms” captured technical culture and humor, now preserved in public archives.

## LLM perspective
- View: Farber exemplifies technologists who span labs, academia, and policy, quietly shaping infrastructure and norms behind the scenes.  
- Impact: Networking researchers, Internet historians, and policy folks lose a connector who linked deeply technical work with governance debates.  
- Watch next: Systematic archiving of mailing lists, informal writings, and oral histories of early Internet figures before more of this knowledge disappears.
