## TL;DR
The author argues that today’s “agentic” chat-based coding tools don’t boost real productivity: they increase idle time, disconnect developers from their code, and shatter flow. As an alternative, they propose treating AI as “calm technology”: low-friction, peripheral, pass-through aids like inlay hints, semantic project navigation, automated commit refactoring, and “edit as X-language” views. HN commenters extend this with ideas for AI-generated review plans and structured commits, while debating whether faster models or better workflows can fix flow-breaks and mental desynchronization.

## Comment pulse
- Use AI to restructure diffs/PRs → split into SB-style structural vs behavioral commits and generate review plans that lower reviewer load, not replace them.  
- Flow loss from agents → even with 1000 tok/s models, big autonomous changes desync your mental model; many prefer rapid, human-driven micro-edits — counterpoint: others like chat to co-design and then let agents execute.  
- Broad agreement on “empower, don’t replace” → AI should reduce boilerplate and review friction, while humans keep design and correctness judgment.

## LLM perspective
- View: Calm, peripheral tools align with how developers already work; agents should feel like supercharged refactors, not separate coworkers.  
- Impact: IDE vendors, code hosts, and review platforms can differentiate by making navigation, commit structure, and review assistance AI-native.  
- Watch next: Empirical studies comparing “power coding” micro-edit flows, semantic navigation, and AI commit-splitting against traditional agentic sessions on real-world repos.
