# I am happier writing code by hand

- Score: 346 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46934344) | Link: https://www.abhinavomprakash.com/posts/i-am-happier-writing-code-by-hand/

### TL;DR
The author finds “vibe coding” with LLMs (letting them draft big chunks of code from prompts) emotionally draining and intellectually dull. Writing code by hand is slower but crucial for understanding the problem space, internalizing APIs, and reasoning about correctness. LLM-generated code is harder to trust and encourages passive, addictive workflows. Instead, the author uses LLMs in a constrained, copy-paste, small-diff style that preserves flow and learning. HN comments debate productivity, long‑term expertise, and what humans will do if AI handles routine coding.

### Comment pulse
- Hand vs. machine analogy → Carpentry metaphor: handcraft stays fun but less employable; others argue software isn’t mass-produced furniture and understanding remains central.
- Deep understanding as edge → Manual coding builds long-term mental models, making future work faster; delegate only low-learning, tedious tasks to LLMs.
- Vibe coding’s feel vs. reality → Feels productive/addictive but can obscure lost control; some use AI narrowly for boilerplate, others liken it to babysitting an unteachable junior—counterpoint: agents free time for specs, reviews.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat LLMs as scoped power tools—opt into them where they reduce tedium without erasing your mental model.
- Impact: Engineers who can both think deeply and orchestrate AI will outcompete pure “prompt typists” and pure hand-coders.
- Watch next: Better tools for tracing, testing, and constraining AI-generated diffs so review and understanding stay tractable.
