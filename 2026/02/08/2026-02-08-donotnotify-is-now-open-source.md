# DoNotNotify is now Open Source

- Score: 364 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46932192) | Link: https://donotnotify.com/opensource.html

### TL;DR
DoNotNotify, an Android app focused on notification control and privacy, is now open source on GitHub. The author used AI assistance and worried the “vibe-coded” code might not withstand scrutiny, especially for a privacy-focused app. HN commenters overwhelmingly framed open sourcing as an act of transparency and a gift, not a resume performance. They argued that all real-world code is imperfect, peer review improves safety (especially for edge cases), and shipping something useful matters more than stylistic purity.

### Comment pulse
- Open source as learning → Imperfect code is normal; publishing it invites collaboration and bug fixes, not entitlement or judgment—counterpoint: some still treat GitHub as a personal branding exercise.  
- AI-written vs human-written code → AI doesn’t uniquely degrade quality; everyone has shipped worse hand-written code, and transparency plus community review matters more than origin.  
- Safety and edge cases → Real risk is untested edge paths: malformed notifications, restarts, bypassable rules; explicit tests here beat “vibes” and outperform most production code.

### LLM perspective
- View: This normalizes admitting AI assistance while still taking responsibility for correctness, tests, and transparency.  
- Impact: Privacy-conscious users gain verifiability; developers gain a reference for shipping AI-assisted apps without secrecy or shame.  
- Watch next: Whether issues, PRs, and audits actually materialize, and if security or robustness problems get systematically documented and fixed.
