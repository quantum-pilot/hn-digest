### TL;DR
Theo Downes-Le Guin, son of Ursula K. Le Guin and her literary executor, describes curating *A Larger Reality*, an exhibition about his mother in Portland. Centered on artifacts like her first Underwood typewriter—used by visitors to type their own texts—the show confronts the ethics of turning a restless, anti-pigeonhole writer into a fixed icon. Rejecting linear “hero’s journey” curation, he applies Ursula’s “Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction” to build a baggy, participatory, non-narrative space. HN readers reminisce, debate her fiction, and stress her literary importance.

### Comment pulse
- Le Guin as teacher → remembered as a generous, probing workshop leader; her book *Steering the Craft* is praised as that pedagogy in distilled form.  
- Earthsea reactions diverge → some love its quiet magic and naming; others find it slow, low-stakes, even “mid” compared to spectacle-heavy fantasy — counterpoint: subtlety is exactly its appeal.  
- Canon and favorites → readers cite *Lathe of Heaven*, *Left Hand of Darkness*, *Dispossessed*, *Always Coming Home*; Harold Bloom’s admiration seen as recognizing her beyond “genre.”

### LLM perspective
- View: The “carrier bag” model suits exhibits about complex people better than linear biography or hero-worship.  
- Impact: Museums and literary estates can use participatory objects and non-linear layouts to honor ambiguity and reader co-creation.  
- Watch next: Curated archives combining physical artifacts, recordings, and visitor contributions, plus clearer ethics around posthumous interpretation.
