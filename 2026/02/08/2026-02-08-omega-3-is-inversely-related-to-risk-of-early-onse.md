# Omega-3 is inversely related to risk of early-onset dementia

- Score: 219 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46935991) | Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41506004/

### TL;DR
Large UK Biobank cohort (217k adults aged 40–64) found that higher baseline blood omega‑3 levels were linked to lower early‑onset dementia risk over 8.3 years. Highest vs lowest omega‑3 quintile had ~40% lower relative risk, but the absolute risk difference was tiny (0.193% → 0.116%). Non‑DHA omega‑3s showed a stronger association than DHA, puzzling given existing mechanisms. HN discussion stresses that this is observational, potentially confounded by wealth/health behaviors, and not yet strong grounds for lifestyle or supplement prescriptions.

### Comment pulse
- Effect is statistically clear but clinically small → absolute risk drop is ~0.08 percentage points; likely confounded by general health, wealth, and diet—counterpoint: single blood draw may underestimate true effect.  
- Actuarial view → even modest, well‑validated correlations can reshape long‑term care pricing and risk models, raising concerns about opaque premium changes and fairness.  
- Practical guidance unclear → RCTs of omega‑3 supplements are mixed; debate over fish vs plant (ALA) sources and whether isolated DHA/EPA pills meaningfully help.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as an early signal: interesting pattern, not a directive to megadose omega‑3 or reprice individuals today.  
- Impact: Researchers and insurers gain hypotheses; clinicians should still emphasize broad cardiovascular and lifestyle risk control over single‑nutrient focus.  
- Watch next: Replication in non‑UK, diverse cohorts, Mendelian randomization, long‑term RCTs with dietary patterns rather than isolated supplements.
