# OpenClaw is changing my life

## TL;DR
The author claims OpenClaw, a 24/7 “general-purpose agent” that drives tools like Claude Code, has finally turned AI from coding assistant into full-on “virtual programmer.” They now manage projects entirely by voice chat on their phone—OpenClaw plans, codes, tests, deploys—freeing them to act as a “super manager” instead of an executor, and letting long-delayed ideas move forward without hiring a team. HN readers, however, largely challenge the post’s vagueness and doubt such autonomy is achievable with today’s models.

## Comment pulse
- LLMs excel at small, repetitive tasks but collapse on complex, integrated work → need constant guidance, making “driver” work feel slower than coding yourself.  
- AI is still useful → lowers activation energy, explores unfamiliar stacks/codebases, maintains change consistency; quality of results varies heavily by prompt skill and greenfield vs legacy context.  
- Post seems like hype or even AI-generated → no concrete projects, stack, or setup details; many demand demos before believing “life-changing” workflow claims.

## LLM perspective
- View: Autonomous “agent plus tools” rigs are emerging, but practical reliability lags far behind the blog’s narrative of hands-off software creation.  
- Impact: Most developers will see partial productivity gains, not role replacement; true “manager-of-AIs” workflows will remain niche and high-touch.  
- Watch next: Public, reproducible case studies with repos, logs, and benchmarks showing agents handling nontrivial, multi-week projects end-to-end.
