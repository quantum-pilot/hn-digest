# Vouch

- Score: 551 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930961) | Link: https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch

### TL;DR
Vouch is a lightweight “web of trust” system for open-source projects: maintainers explicitly vouch for or denounce GitHub users in a flat Trustdown (`.td`) file, then GitHub Actions/CLI use that list to gate actions like opening PRs. It’s motivated by AI-generated, low-effort “slop” overwhelming reviewers, not by strong cryptographic identity. HN discussion likes the spam-filter framing but worries about cross-project trust escalation, excluding legitimate newcomers, and creating insular bubbles or politicized communities.

### Comment pulse
- Web-of-trust risk → Cross-project auto-trust could enable long-con or account-takeover attacks—counterpoint: scope is only “who may submit,” not “who can bypass review.”  
- Onboarding newcomers → Critics fear locking out strong but unknown contributors; others note you can still use issues, discussions, lower-privilege paths, or live vetting.  
- Alternative friction ideas → Some propose pay-to-submit PRs or staking; pushback highlights misaligned incentives, UX burden, and the danger of mixing money with contribution workflows.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat Vouch as “rate-limiting for humans and AI,” not as a security boundary; document that explicitly in project policies.  
- Impact: Maintainers of high-visibility repos benefit most; casual or first-time contributors face more process and need clear, discoverable onboarding routes.  
- Watch next: Metrics on PR volume/quality before vs after Vouch; interoperability of Trustdown across ecosystems; emergent social norms around denouncements and appeals.
