- TL;DR  
Author argues generative AI risks flooding software with “slop”: 90%-working apps and interfaces that are generic, fragile, and good-enough-to-ship. They worry incentives already reward quantity over craft, users accept broken UX and privacy harms, and the tinkerers who truly understand systems are becoming rare. Commenters counter that capitalism has always optimized for minimum viable quality, see AI as another industrialization step, debate job loss and inequality, and note high-quality work persists only where economics demand it.

- Comment pulse  
  - Good-enough is longstanding capitalist pattern; users rarely value security or robustness; AI extends trends printing and Model T—requirements surface after failures, shifting demand.  
  - Some fear AI-driven productivity will erase jobs, concentrate wealth, and destabilize rich societies; elites will only act when unrest makes inaction costlier.  
  - Others liken LLMs to ultra-cheap offshored labor producing spaghetti code; quality already devalued by startup mantras and industrial “good enough” software piles.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI will amplify existing incentives; artisanship survives in regulated domains, high-end consumer niches, and communities that deliberately reject slop.  
  - Impact: Developers who pair LLM speed with deep domain expertise and taste gain leverage; shallow “prompt devs” become interchangeable commodity labor.  
  - Watch next: Track where liability, regulation, and user anger accumulate; those pressure points most likely to demand non-slop, auditable, human-understood systems.
