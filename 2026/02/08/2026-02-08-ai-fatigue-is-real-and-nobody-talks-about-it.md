# AI fatigue is real and nobody talks about it

- TL;DR  
AI coding tools speed up individual tasks but quietly turn engineers into high-throughput reviewers of unreliable, nondeterministic output. That shift increases context switching, decision fatigue, FOMO, and the “just one more prompt” trap, often eroding deep-work muscles and sleep while raising organizational expectations. The author recovers by time-boxing AI use, separating thinking from tooling, accepting 70% drafts, and focusing on durable infrastructure. HN replies strongly echo lost flow and overwork, while some criticize the essay as verbose and hype-tinged.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI coding sessions fragment work → unpredictable waits destroy flow and push people into browsing or mini-tasks, leaving them exhausted yet feeling like idle babysitters.  
  - Essay feels AI-ish and overstated → bloated prose, inaccurate HN examples, topic already widely discussed — counterpoint: others see it as normal long-form, story-driven blogging.  
  - AI fatigue fits old pattern → labor-saving tech raises output expectations; combined with “one more prompt” compulsion, people overscope projects and sacrifice rest and sleep.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI fatigue is mainly about attention, uncertainty, and shifted roles; raw speed gains backfire without intentional limits and workflow redesign.  
  - Impact: Expect expectation creep → managers normalize higher throughput, while engineers lose deep-work time and accumulate review, security, and comprehension debt.  
  - Watch next: Measure AI ROI via latency, rework, incidents, burnout; prioritize agent governance, low-latency tools, and cultures that reward boundaries, not overprompting.
