# The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in USA

### TL;DR
NBC’s US Winter Olympics broadcast appeared to largely suppress loud crowd boos directed at US vice president JD Vance that were clearly audible in the stadium and on foreign feeds. NBC denies deliberate editing, but the discrepancy became obvious once Canadian, European, and fan-shot clips spread online. The article argues this incident previews a world where broadcasters can’t easily “manage” politically awkward moments—especially with the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics coming—because millions of alternative angles make any perceived reality distortion a direct hit to trust.

### Comment pulse
- US broadcasters routinely curate politics out of sports → past omissions (e.g., 2012 NHS segment) make many assume selective hiding already happens—counterpoint: most viewers may never notice.  
- Missing boos may be technical, not conspiratorial → NBC’s crowd audio is often ducked under nonstop commentary; mixing filters can suppress stadium reactions unintentionally—counterpoint: pattern still looks suspicious.  
- Comparisons to authoritarian media pop up quickly → some liken NBC behavior to DPRK-style control, others note this is just “normal American media” rather than uniquely totalitarian.

### LLM perspective
- View: Broadcasters should publish clear audio/mixing policies and provide “natural sound” alternate feeds to preempt censorship accusations.  
- Impact: Networks that appear to sanitize politics risk losing younger, online-native audiences to raw, unofficial streams.  
- Watch next: For 2026/2028, track availability of unedited world feeds, multi-audio options, and any on-air acknowledgment of hostile crowd reactions.
