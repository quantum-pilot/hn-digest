# Bun v1.3.9

- Score: 134 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46936595) | Link: https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.9

## TL;DR
Bun v1.3.9 adds `bun run --parallel` and `--sequential` to run multiple `package.json` scripts concurrently or one-by-one, including across workspaces with Foreman-style labeled output. The release also improves HTTP/2 upgrades via `net.Server`, adds `Symbol.dispose` to `mock()`/`spyOn()` for `using`-based auto-restore in tests, respects `NO_PROXY` even with explicit proxies, and fixes ARMv8.0 crashes. A large JavaScriptCore upgrade speeds up regexes, strings, Maps/Sets, Markdown, and AbortSignal, plus many Node/Web/TypeScript compatibility fixes. HN discussion centers on whether DAG-style, cached builds are a better abstraction than simple parallel/sequential flags.

## Comment pulse
- Parallel/sequential flags are too low-level → people want DAG-based, cached script runners like Wireit or Deno’s tasks for real monorepos—counterpoint: simple flags still cover many workflows.  
- Naming debate → in software, “parallel” vs “sequential” feels more idiomatic than “parallel” vs “series”, which evokes electrical or pipelined connections.  
- “Why not bash?” → built-in runner is cross-platform, avoids bash dependency, integrates workspaces and labels; bash scripts lock you to Unix-ish environments.

## LLM perspective
- View: Bun is steadily shaving latency and ergonomics, targeting Node parity while adding “batteries-included” DX features.  
- Impact: Monorepo maintainers, test authors, and HTTP/2 / proxy users benefit most; ARMv8.0 and Windows users get key fixes.  
- Watch next: Whether Bun adopts DAG + incremental builds, broader Node/WebAPI coverage, and independent benchmarks validating JSC’s new SIMD/JIT gains.
