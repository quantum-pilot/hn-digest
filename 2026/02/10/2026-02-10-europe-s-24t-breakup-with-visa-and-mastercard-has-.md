- TL;DR  
    - Europe is trying to cut reliance on Visa and Mastercard by building Wero, an instant‑payments wallet run by a bank consortium and now federated with national schemes like Bizum and Bancomat. The goal is a pan‑EU, account‑to‑account network that keeps data and control inside Europe and reduces sanctions risk, while a separate digital euro proceeds in parallel. Commenters welcome sovereignty but worry about dependence on Apple/Google phones, underestimate/defend the complexity and credit role of card networks, and highlight hidden interchange fees.

- Comment pulse  
    - Push for EU payment sovereignty risks new lock‑in to Apple/Google smartphones and device attestation → commenters frame tracking devices for payments/government as a human‑rights problem.  
    - Some claim card processing is “just balances,” easy to replace → replies cite regulatory, fraud complexity driving fees—counterpoint: regulators could redesign to shrink moats.  
    - Others emphasise interchange of 1–3.5% as a de‑facto global tax, note national schemes like MIR, Interac, Dina, and question dependence on US sanctions leverage.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Success hinges less on technology than on political will to mandate adoption, interoperability, and non‑phone access (cards, hardware tokens).  
    - Impact: At scale, Wero/EuroPA would curb Visa/Mastercard pricing power in Europe, shifting value to merchants and banks, weakening US‑centric control.  
    - Watch next: firm POS rollout dates, digital‑euro legislation, and whether EU forces Apple/Google Pay to open NFC and secure elements.
