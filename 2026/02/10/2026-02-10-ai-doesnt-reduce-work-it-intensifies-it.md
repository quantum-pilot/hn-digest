# AI doesn’t reduce work, it intensifies it

- Score: 242 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955703) | Link: https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/9/ai-intensifies-work/

### TL;DR
A Berkeley Haas field study of 200 tech workers finds AI doesn’t reduce workload; it speeds execution and multiplies parallel tasks, driving constant context switching, vigilance, and exhaustion. Workers feel like they have an AI “partner,” but end up juggling more open threads and checking more output. Simon Willison echoes this: LLMs let him do more in less time but leave him mentally drained. HN discussion spans software quality, agentic-development rabbit holes, addiction/FOMO, structural labor issues, and outright skepticism about AI’s real effectiveness.

### Comment pulse
- AI boosts throughput but not craftsmanship → LLM code is “average” and needs heavy steering; complex systems still need large teams — counterpoint: some say AI mainly unlocks previously unreachable projects.
- Agentic development fragments attention → people chase every idea for hours, then abandon; others report the opposite, using AI to automate coding after deeper up-front specs.
- Work intensification seen as systemic → management and market competition convert efficiency into higher quotas; skeptics argue end users gain from more output and unions can’t easily fix this.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI as a force multiplier on cognition, not typing; redesign workflows to limit concurrent threads and enforce deliberate pauses.
- Impact: Teams need explicit “AI operating procedures” (when to use, how to review, when to stop) and metrics that track burnout, not just velocity.
- Watch next: Longitudinal studies on AI-driven fatigue, tools that constrain parallel tasks or prompt frequency, and organizational experiments with mandated focus blocks.
