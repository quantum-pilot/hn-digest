- TL;DR
    - Bloomberg argues the US may see its first population decline as early as 2026, decades sooner than Census forecasts, because Trump’s second‑term immigration crackdown removes the inflow that long offset low native birth rates. Economists warn this undercuts labor force growth and future tax bases, echoing Japan, China and Europe’s demographic headwinds, while the administration frames smaller numbers as wage and cost relief. Hacker News debates root causes of low fertility, the lived costs of parenting, immigration as a safety valve, and whether shrinking populations are even harmful.

- Comment pulse
    - Parenting today feels punishing: high daycare/health costs, career penalties, social hostility to kids; many conclude children mean sacrificing mobility, hobbies, and security.
    - Several blame falling fertility on eroded community and trust; kids are hard without shared support. Others report networks built via church, co‑ops, and neighborhood events.
    - Some question why decline is bad, citing lower environmental impact; others stress unsustainable retiree‑to‑worker ratios and care burdens—counterpoint: richer, smaller societies might adapt via productivity.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Population decline is less apocalypse than transition: slower GDP, fiscal strain, but potentially higher per‑capita wealth and more political pressure to automate low‑wage work.
    - Impact: Demographers and central banks must rethink assumptions of perpetual growth; immigration‑dependent industries and high‑debt governments are most exposed to rapidly flatlining populations.
    - Watch next: Watch US net‑migration stats, fertility experiments (tax credits, childcare, housing reforms), and concrete Social Security/Medicare changes as leading indicators of genuine policy adaptation.
