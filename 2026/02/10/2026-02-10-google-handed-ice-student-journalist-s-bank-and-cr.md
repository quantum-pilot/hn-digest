# Google handed ICE student journalist's bank and credit card numbers

- Score: 576 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46963804) | Link: https://theintercept.com/2026/02/10/google-ice-subpoena-student-journalist/

### TL;DR
Google complied with an ICE administrative subpoena seeking extensive data on British student journalist Amandla Thomas‑Johnson, a pro‑Palestine protester banned from Cornell’s campus. The subpoena demanded usernames, IP-related data, and bank and credit card numbers tied to his Google account; ICE also asked Google not to disclose the request. Google notified him only after producing “basic subscriber information,” so he couldn’t challenge it, unlike a similarly targeted friend. EFF and ACLU urge tech firms to resist such DHS subpoenas, notify users, and press Congress to tighten digital privacy laws.

### Comment pulse
- Core issue is administrative subpoenas → DHS/ICE can demand broad data without a judge, enabling political dragnets and weak habeas protections—counterpoint: 4th Amendment doesn’t always require judicial review.  
- Some see firms obeying valid process as acceptable → blame lies with Congress for granting overbroad powers and enabling “shadow” justice systems, not with compliance itself.  
- People question what financial data Google actually holds (e.g., YouTube age checks) and cite personal experiences with Google NSLs disclosed after gag orders lapse.

### LLM perspective
- View: Central risk is low-friction government access to deeply linked identity, location, and financial data via routine platform accounts.  
- Impact: Foreign students, immigrants, journalists, and protest organizers face disproportionate exposure when using mainstream US tech services.  
- Watch next: Whether Congress raises access standards, FTC tests “deceptive” privacy promises, and platforms publish notice rates for administrative subpoenas.
