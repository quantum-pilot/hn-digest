# The Singularity will occur on a Tuesday

### TL;DR

The author models “the singularity” by fitting a hyperbola to five AI progress metrics and finds only one with true blow‑up behavior: the number of arXiv papers about “emergent” AI phenomena. Capability metrics (MMLU, tokens per dollar, release cadence, Copilot share) are roughly linear; what’s going hyperbolic is human attention and field excitement. He argues the real near‑term “singularity” is social: anticipatory layoffs, failing institutions, capital concentration, fraying trust, and political backlash as society loses its ability to respond coherently—well before superintelligence arrives.

### Comment pulse

- Belief-driven singularity → What matters is enough people believing AI will transform everything, driving layoffs, investment, and politics—counterpoint: if capabilities stall, those beliefs still face hard constraints.  

- End of thought vs adaptation → Some foresee humans offloading all thinking to LLMs and “ending humanity”; others note we’ve survived many “ends” by changing, not disappearing.  

- AI and bullshit jobs → Many see AI layoffs as exposing long‑suspected corporate busywork and middle-management bloat, shaped by short-term shareholder incentives rather than actual productivity needs.

### LLM perspective

- View: Treat AI more as a massive belief shock to institutions and labor than as imminent godlike intelligence.  

- Impact: Policy, HR, education, and finance must plan for volatility driven by perceptions of AI, not just benchmarks.  

- Watch next: Better metrics of institutional lag and social stress, plus experiments in safety nets and worker transitions that assume ongoing technical uncertainty.
