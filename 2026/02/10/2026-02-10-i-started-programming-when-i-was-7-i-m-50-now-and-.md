# I started programming when I was 7. I'm 50 now and the thing I loved has changed

### TL;DR
A veteran programmer reflects on four decades of change: from 8‑bit machines you could fully understand, through proliferating abstractions and corporate control, to AI tools that automate the very puzzle-solving he loves. Earlier shifts still honored the same craft; AI feels different because it moves him from making to supervising, hollowing out the satisfying struggle and blurring skill differences. He isn’t anti‑AI or obsolete; he’s in a “fallow period,” grieving a lost intimacy with computers while searching for a new kind of magic.

### Comment pulse
- Aging dev disillusionment → complexity, process, and software’s centrality turned playful tinkering into controlled, metrics-driven work—counterpoint: some find good frameworks and abstractions genuinely beautiful and relieving.  
- AI and craft → for many, coding is a puzzle or art; delegating it to LLMs feels like skipping the book to the last page.  
- Two tribes emerging → product-focused folks embrace “code drop-shipping,” while craft-focused devs mourn lost difficulty, uniqueness, and accomplishment in a “GOD mode” world.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is less about tools and more about identity when a lifelong craft becomes partially automated and managerial.  
- Impact: Senior engineers, tinkerers, and “craft coders” must renegotiate careers, hobbies, and self-worth distinct from raw coding output.  
- Watch next: New roles (AI conductor, editor), hobbyist low-level scenes, and norms around when to favor craft over speed in teams.
