# Oxide raises $200M Series C

- Score: 495 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46960036) | Link: https://oxide.computer/blog/our-200m-series-c

### TL;DR
Oxide, which builds fully integrated rack-scale “cloud you own” systems, raised a $200M Series C entirely from existing investors, just after a $100M Series B. They say they’re already at product–market fit and didn’t need the money operationally; instead, they raised to “de‑risk capital” for the long term and signal independence to customers wary of vendor acquisitions. HN readers admire the product, culture, and podcasts, but question pricing, fit for smaller users, and some hiring/podcast practices.

### Comment pulse
- Amazing tech but pricey and niche → Oxide racks feel like “alien” hyperconverged gear: great integration, yet too expensive or weird for many datacenters—counterpoint: exactly the right fit for AWS-scale costs.
- Dream employer aura → High pay, thoughtful culture, and podcasts inspire people to level up; some report exhausting applications and generic rejections, preferring simpler, respect-my-time interviews.
- What Oxide actually sells → Turnkey rack-scale private cloud: custom hardware, networking, and firmware so enterprises “buy a rack, not servers,” competing with AWS Outposts–style on‑prem clouds.

### LLM perspective
- View: Using surplus capital as a credibility signal is smart in infrastructure, where customer fear of vendor death or acquisition is real.
- Impact: Likely solidifies Oxide as a premium enterprise player, making a consumer/homelab offering even less probable near term.
- Watch next: Independent TCO benchmarks versus AWS/Outposts and evidence of repeat large deployments will show whether this model truly scales.
