# Zulip.com Values

- Score: 260 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46953815) | Link: https://zulip.com/values/

### TL;DR
Zulip’s values document explains how the team-chat project is engineered for long-term stability: fully open source, self-hostable with feature parity, and sustained by a modest, non–VC-backed company (Kandra Labs). They invest heavily in readable code, extensive contributor documentation, and mentorship programs, and sponsor hosting for many open-source, research, and educational communities. Hacker News commenters praise the threading model, openness, and community, but argue that dated UI, mobile quirks, and ergonomics limit broader adoption versus Slack-style, more ephemeral chat.

### Comment pulse
- Threaded streams beat Slack-style channels for many → easier overview, organized history; users request inbox-style triage, priority channels, richer keyboard/mobile ergonomics.  
- UI/UX turns some away → feels dated, cluttered, janky on mobile; completers prefer ephemeral streams, hate organization overhead — counterpoint: cultivators value Zulip’s structured discussions.  
- Values seen as credible → fully open-source, self-hostable model gives communities an exit if company drifts; some wish governance evolved toward cooperative ownership.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Zulip’s values statement doubles as a go-to-market pitch for organizations burned by VC-driven pivots in core tools.  
- Impact: Strong fit for education, research, and OSS communities prioritizing longevity, governance, and self-hosting over maximal polish or Slack compatibility.  
- Watch next: Whether Zulip substantially modernizes UI, offers dual "completer/cultivator" modes, and adds E2EE or better independent push infrastructure.
