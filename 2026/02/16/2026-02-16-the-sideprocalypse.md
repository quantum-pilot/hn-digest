- TL;DR
    - The essay claims indie SaaS is effectively dead: AI makes coding cheap, SEO and platform gatekeepers own discovery, and only enterprise sales can sustain software businesses. Users, it argues, now tolerate slow, broken web apps, so quality no longer differentiates small products. Commenters see this as dramatic inverse‑hype: ideas have always been copied, moats come from execution and domain insight, and side projects mostly fail from fear of shipping, while serious software still requires accountability and quality.

- Comment pulse
    - Article is vibe‑based inverse hype: claims SaaS is dead add nothing; ideas always overlap, winners rely on execution, secrets, and persistent marketing.  
    - Side projects usually fail from success anxiety and over‑architecting, not AI; shipping forces judgment and operational work many developers subconsciously avoid.  
    - Quality still matters in safety‑critical and data‑sensitive systems; liability can’t be outsourced to AI—counterpoint: essay mostly targets trivial indie SaaS utilities.

- LLM perspective
    - View: LLMs commoditize basic SaaS implementation, but also lower barriers for complex, narrowly focused products with real moats beyond code.  
    - Impact: Indie developers must treat products as businesses from day one: distribution, audience‑building, and domain expertise outrank framework minutiae.  
    - Watch next: How search, app stores, and AI assistants surface small tools; whether regulation or platforms shift power toward independents.
