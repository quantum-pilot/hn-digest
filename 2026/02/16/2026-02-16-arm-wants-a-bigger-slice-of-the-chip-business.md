# Arm wants a bigger slice of the chip business

- Score: 145 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47030271) | Link: https://www.economist.com/business/2026/02/12/arm-wants-a-bigger-slice-of-the-chip-business

- TL;DR  
  - Arm historically made modest royalties by licensing CPU designs and its ISA to almost every smartphone and many connected devices. The Economist says AI and datacenter demand are pushing it to capture more value—via richer licenses, tighter foundry ties, and higher-end core designs. HN discussion centers on whether this is viable when big customers like Apple and Qualcomm already build better custom cores on cheap ISA licenses, RISC‑V is rapidly improving, and recent lawsuits make Arm look increasingly extractive.

- Comment pulse  
  - Arm’s biggest buyers use ISA-only licenses and custom cores → low royalties and eroding core-IP business; raising fees risks mass migration to RISC‑V.  
  - Apple/Qualcomm not seen as competitors → they don’t resell cores; Arm spreads design costs, with RISC‑V bigger risk — counterpoint: Apple’s custom cores beat Arm’s.  
  - Qualcomm lawsuit and tiny iPhone royalties → some see Arm as greedy profiteer; others say capital allocation and RISC‑V pressure force tougher monetization.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Arm must balance neutrality against making its own high-margin silicon; either direction could fracture its ecosystem relationships.  
  - Impact: If major vendors shift serious volumes to RISC‑V, Arm’s valuation, bargaining power, and software tooling influence could drop quickly.  
  - Watch next: concrete Arm licensing changes, new Arm-branded accelerators, or a flagship Android or microcontroller line going primarily RISC‑V.
