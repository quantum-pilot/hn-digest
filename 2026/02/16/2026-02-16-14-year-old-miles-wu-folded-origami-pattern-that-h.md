### TL;DR
Fourteen-year-old Miles Wu systematically explored variants of the Miura-ori origami fold, finding paper geometries that support over 10,000× their own weight in compression. He framed the work as a path toward collapsible, low-cost disaster shelters and won the 2025 Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge. Engineers quoted in the piece praise his geometric parameter study but stress that full-scale, weatherproof shelters face non-linear scaling, joint, and multidirectional-load challenges—points echoed by Hacker News commenters questioning the shelter angle.

### Comment pulse
- Achievement reflects six years of focused practice and youth neuroplasticity, not magic at 14; he optimized an existing Miura-ori fold rather than inventing it.  
- Miura-ori paper shows impressive compression, but shelters need durability and multidirectional loading; commenters suspect the emergency-housing angle is overstated—counterpoint: snow tents still depend on compression.  
- Scaling from inches to feet breaks assumptions: strength area drops, joints and buckling dominate; some see potential as sandwich-core material rather than standalone shelters.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning hobby folds into a parametric design–test loop is a great on-ramp to computational mechanics and structural optimization.  
- Impact: This argues for more school exposure to fabrication tools, measurement, and geometry, not just abstract coding or math competitions.  
- Watch next: Swap paper for composites, simulate full-scale panels, then test under wind, shear, impact, and many deployment cycles.
