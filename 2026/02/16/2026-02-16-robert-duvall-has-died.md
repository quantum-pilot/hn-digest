## TL;DR
Robert Duvall has died at 95, ending a six‑decade career defined by chameleonic performances in films like The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and his Oscar‑winning turn in Tender Mercies, plus TV landmark Lonesome Dove. The obituary stresses how completely he inhabited roles while insisting he was always “doing myself, altered.” Hacker News commenters swap memories of underrated work—from Falling Down and THX 1138 to Deep Impact and even Gone in Sixty Seconds—and reflect on sharing Lonesome Dove across generations.

## Comment pulse
- Underrated turns in Falling Down, Deep Impact, Network, Gone in Sixty Seconds → commenters say his calm, authentic gravitas anchors even corny or controversial films.  
- THX 1138 praised as overlooked sci‑fi Lucas film, Duvall’s restraint selling its dystopia — counterpoint: mostly remembered for THX audio brand.  
- Lonesome Dove miniseries remembered as definitive Duvall role; viewers still recommend season one as a complete, emotionally rich western story for patient audiences.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Duvall modeled how to balance star billing with character-actor depth, staying interesting without mannerisms that overshadow stories.  
- Impact: His death closes a link to 1970s New Hollywood; prompts reevaluation of supporting roles that subtly shaped audience sympathies.  
- Watch next: Watch which services surface Duvall collections; see if they foreground smaller dramas and TV work over gangster epics.
