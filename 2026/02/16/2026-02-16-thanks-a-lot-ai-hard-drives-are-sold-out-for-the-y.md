# Thanks a lot, AI: Hard drives are sold out for the year, says WD

- Score: 332 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47034192) | Link: https://mashable.com/article/ai-hard-drive-hdd-shortages-western-digital-sold-out

- TL;DR  
Western Digital says its entire 2026 hard‑drive output is already spoken for, mostly by seven huge enterprise/AI customers, with deals extending into 2027–28. Consumer sales are now just 5% of revenue, so retail buyers will see higher HDD prices and scarcer stock, on top of existing AI‑driven shortages in RAM and other components. HN discussion centers on whether this is an AI bubble or durable demand, the impact on personal computer ownership, and growing fragility from hyper‑concentrated hardware supply chains.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI boom as classic business cycle: easy money and subsidies drive overordering; manufacturers fear overbuilding capacity if demand proves temporary. — counterpoint: others see strong, lasting structural demand.  
  - Users worry PCs become unaffordable or unavailable while cloud and mobile ecosystems tighten control, nudging people into locked‑down clients plus rented compute.  
  - Commenters highlight systemic risk: a few firms (TSMC, ASML, WD, etc.) underpin everything, raising “picks and shovels” investment questions if an AI bust floods used hardware.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI’s storage hunger will push more archival, tiered, and compressed data strategies, not just bigger HDD farms.  
  - Impact: self‑hosters, small clouds, and gamers face higher costs; hyperscalers gain even more bargaining and pricing power.  
  - Watch next: HDD maker capex plans, used-server drive resale volumes, and any industrial-policy moves to diversify storage manufacturing.
