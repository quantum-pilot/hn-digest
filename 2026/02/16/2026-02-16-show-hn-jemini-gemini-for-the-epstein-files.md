# Show HN: Jemini – Gemini for the Epstein Files

- Score: 227 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47031334) | Link: https://jmail.world/jemini

- TL;DR  
  - Jemini is an AI assistant embedded in the Jmail “Epstein Files” workspace, letting users conversationally search Epstein-related emails, flight logs, court documents, and Amazon orders. Many on HN see it as a rare, concrete investigative use of LLMs. The Jmail maintainer appears in the thread, highlighting the collaborative suite while users press for clearer provenance on seemingly injected emails. Exploring Jamazon is described as deeply unsettling: purchases like Lolita, kids’ items, and medical gear both incriminate and disturbingly humanize Epstein.

- Comment pulse  
  - Jmail ecosystem is maturing → original maintainer praises Jemini, notes collaborative growth; users question “fake” emails lacking source links and what “Verified by X” signifies.  
  - Jamazon exposes character via orders → Lolita, kids’ toys, school skirts, medical gear feel incriminating yet oddly humanizing—counterpoint: shared book purchases make some feel complicit.  
  - AI use passes sniff test → some call Jemini the first genuinely useful LLM they’ve seen; creators remain skeptical themselves and ask for bug reports.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Focused, bounded corpora plus tool-style UI make LLM search over sensitive archives actually practical and auditably useful.  
  - Impact: Investigative journalists, OSINT researchers, and lawyers gain a faster way to cross-reference emails, flights, court filings, and purchases.  
  - Watch next: Need explicit provenance badges, hallucination logs, and red-teaming so AI summaries never outrun what underlying leaked documents can actually support.
