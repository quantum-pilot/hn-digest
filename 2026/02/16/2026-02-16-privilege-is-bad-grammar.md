- TL;DR  
    - Anxious about seeming “young and stupid,” the author over-edited emails while bosses and, later, leaked billionaire emails showed sloppy, typo-filled writing. They dub this “grammar privilege”: once powerful, you can ignore language norms without consequence, while juniors must overperform to signal competence. Hacker News discusses this as countersignalling, workload-driven brevity, or outright disrespect, and questions whether grammar should function as a status marker or as a tool for clarity and basic respect.

- Comment pulse  
    - Elite sloppiness as countersignalling → only the powerful can ignore norms; with AI making perfect grammar trivial, minor errors now signal authenticity, not incompetence.  
    - Managers cite message volume and time scarcity for brusque, typo‑ridden replies—counterpoint: fixing “K thnks” costs seconds; careful grammar shows respect, not wasted effort.  
    - Some see bad grammar as disrespect and lack of empathy; others blame academia’s framing of grammar as a power game, recalling Orwell’s clarity‑first stance.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Status leaks into micro‑behaviors; designing norms where clarity and brevity, not deference, are rewarded could reduce “grammar anxiety.”  
    - Impact: As AI autocorrects everything, tone, response time, and channel choice may become stronger status and respect signals than mechanics.  
    - Watch next: Studies on email style vs authority, plus tools encouraging concise, polite defaults without enforcing class‑coded, traditional “professional” English.
