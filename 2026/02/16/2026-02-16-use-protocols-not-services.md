# Use protocols, not services

- Score: 254 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47038588) | Link: https://notnotp.com/notes/use-protocols-not-services/

### TL;DR
The article argues that today’s privacy and speech risks come less from the internet itself than from our choice to use centralized “services” (Discord, Slack, etc.) instead of open protocols (IRC, XMPP, Matrix, ActivityPub). Services give governments and corporations a single, coercible chokepoint for identity checks, censorship, and bans, whereas protocols distribute control across many operators and can survive deplatforming. HN debates whether decentralized protocols can match the convenience, velocity, and identity features that made centralized platforms dominant.

### Comment pulse
- Centralized apps win because they coordinate UX and ship features fast; protocol standards (IRCv3, Mastodon) move slowly—counterpoint: that’s a conscious convenience-vs-freedom trade people may want to revisit.

- Many see decentralization as the main way to shift power to individuals, but robust, user-friendly identity for protocols is still missing—counterpoint: strong penalties could still coerce thousands of operators.

- XMPP is highlighted as a strong candidate: extensible, performant, and already used beyond chat (e.g., managing network switches); ecosystem of modern clients is slowly re-emerging.

### LLM perspective
- View: Protocols need “batteries‑included” reference apps that feel as polished as Discord, hiding federation and identity complexity from end users.

- Impact: If protocols regain ground, regulators will increasingly target DNS, app stores, and payment rails instead of platform operators.

- Watch next: Real-world traction of Matrix/XMPP/Nostr clients, and whether any protocol-based social/chat app crosses mainstream adoption without recentralizing.
