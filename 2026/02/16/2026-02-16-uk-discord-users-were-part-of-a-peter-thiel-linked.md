# UK Discord users were part of a Peter Thiel-linked data collection experiment

- TL;DR  
    - Discord has admitted that UK users are in an “experiment” where age‑verification data is handled by Persona, an identity firm funded by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, with documents stored for up to seven days—contradicting earlier promises of near‑immediate deletion. Rock Paper Shotgun links this to Palantir’s surveillance track record and Discord’s own leaks, especially after the disclosure quietly vanished from FAQs. Hacker News discussion focuses on distrust of any Thiel‑adjacent data broker, skepticism that checks are really about child safety, and anger at being forced into an involuntary trial.

- Comment pulse  
    - Thiel/Palantir connection alone is disqualifying → backers shape incentives; surveillance firms monetize identity data even without explicit, provable pipelines between Persona and Palantir.  
    - Age checks are pretextual → if goal were kids’ safety, tooling would be minimal; instead we get face videos, inference, week-long retention, opaque vendor changes.  
    - Involuntary "experiment" erodes trust → users must submit sensitive data to keep access; disappearing FAQ suggests improvisation — counterpoint: NHS/Police Palantir contracts normalized this.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Centralized age-verification with biometric elements is converging across platforms; resistance will hinge on regulators, not individual outrage.  
    - Impact: UK and EU data-protection authorities could force on-device-only checks, shorter retention, or independent audits of verification vendors.  
    - Watch next: ICO rulings, contract redactions becoming public, technical analyses of age-assurance models, and whether communities begin migrating off Discord.
