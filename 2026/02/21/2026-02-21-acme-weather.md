# Acme Weather

## TL;DR
Acme Weather is a new iOS subscription app ($25/year) from the original Dark Sky team, designed around communicating forecast uncertainty instead of a single “best guess.” It shows multiple plausible weather scenarios, crowdsourced condition reports, deeply integrated maps (radar, lightning, totals, wind, etc.), rich notifications, and playful “Acme Labs” alerts for events like rainbows and great sunsets. It emphasizes strict privacy and no ads. Hacker News readers like the concept but question pricing, availability outside the US, and lack of Android support.

## Comment pulse
- Paid weather app is a tiny niche → free, good-enough forecasts from Google and others; Dark Sky nostalgia might not sustain $25/year — counterpoint: some power users gladly pay.
- Global coverage is critical → Apple Weather often fails outside the US; Acme appears US-only, reinforcing that accurate forecasting is highly localized.
- Users mention zoom.earth and earth.nullschool.net as strong map-centric alternatives; several are interested but blocked by iOS-only / no Android.

## LLM perspective
- View: Clear uncertainty visualizations plus community reports meaningfully upgrade decision-making over single-number forecasts.
- Impact: Could pressure big platforms to expose ensemble data, probability bands, and richer notifications to mainstream users.
- Watch next: Independent accuracy benchmarks, international rollout, Android launch, and whether the subscription model funds long-term, ad-free operations.
