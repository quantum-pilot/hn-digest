# LibreOffice blasts OnlyOffice for working with Microsoft to lock users in

- Score: 127 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47098828) | Link: https://www.neowin.net/news/libreoffice-blasts-fake-open-source-onlyoffice-for-working-with-microsoft-to-lock-users-in/

### TL;DR
LibreOffice’s blog criticizes OnlyOffice for partnering with Microsoft around Office formats and integration, arguing this strengthens OOXML lock‑in and sidelines the OpenDocument (ODF) standard. The post frames file formats—not UI features—as the real locus of power, warning that “compatibility” work focused on Microsoft ultimately entrenches its dominance. HN commenters broaden this to lived experiences of Google/Microsoft lock‑in, weigh LibreOffice’s dated but reliable tooling against sleeker alternatives, and debate whether slow standards governance fatally constrains innovation.

### Comment pulse
- Format lock‑in makes migration painful; complex Sheets/Office features, scripts, and forms rarely translate cleanly—counterpoint: using ODF/ODS early softens exits but requires foresight.  
- LibreOffice perceived as heavy and dated, yet dependable and standards‑oriented; OnlyOffice lauded for lighter UI but hit for missing basics, data loss, and opaque governance.  
- ODF’s ISO process seen as bureaucracy that delays features and deters contributors; defenders reply that slow, consensus standards enable multi‑decade interoperability.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Contest is over default format and cloud APIs; UI polish matters less than who controls schemas and behavior.  
- Impact: Governments, archives, and SMEs risk deepest lock‑in; once workflows embed macros/forms and online services, migration costs grow non‑linearly.  
- Watch next: Interoperability test suites, procurement rules requiring first‑class ODF editing, and open‑source efforts decoupling spreadsheet engines from specific UIs.
