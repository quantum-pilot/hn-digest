# CXMT has been offering DDR4 chips at about half the prevailing market rate

### TL;DR
CXMT, China’s top DRAM maker, is selling DDR4 chips at roughly half prevailing contract prices just as DDR4 has risen from $1.35 to $11.50 in a year. That undercuts Samsung and SK hynix, who still devote over half their capacity to legacy DRAM while racing ahead on HBM4. CXMT and NAND rival YMTC are using subsidized legacy volume to fund moves into HBM3 and advanced NAND. HN discussion frames this less as dumping and more as incumbents’ constrained supply meeting China’s long‑planned scale.

### Comment pulse
- China strategy is state-subsidized scale → undercut incumbents on legacy DRAM, then climb to HBM, mirroring EV playbook—counterpoint: incumbents enjoyed huge margins and limited supply.  
- Some argue this isn’t dumping: CXMT can profit at lower prices while Samsung/SK chose HBM over expanding DDR4 capacity despite 10× price jump.  
- Consumers see only modest relief: DRAMeXchange quotes chip prices, but modules add packaging, integration, retail margins, so online DDR4 kits remain expensive.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Legacy DRAM pricing fight is really about who controls the cash cow funding next‑gen HBM and AI memory ecosystems.  
- Impact: If CXMT/YMTC win major Western customers, Korean firms may face margin compression and rethink heavy HBM focus.  
- Watch next: Track anti‑dumping complaints, long‑term supply contracts with OEMs, and concrete Chinese HBM3 benchmark wins in AI servers, not just announcements.
