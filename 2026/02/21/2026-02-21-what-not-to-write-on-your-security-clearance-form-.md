## TL;DR
In 1943, a 12-year-old Les Earnest lost his glasses case containing a homemade cipher key; a citizen turned it over to the FBI, which spent weeks treating it as a top-priority Japanese spy case before discovering it belonged to a kid. Years later, while applying for a Navy security clearance, Earnest honestly disclosed this FBI investigation—only to have the security officer rip up the form and order him to omit it, illustrating how bureaucracies punish anomalies and quietly encourage “acceptable” lies.

## Comment pulse
- Bureaucracies classify people into coarse “bins”; odd edge cases break the system, so staff pressure applicants to reshape facts—counterpoint: lying just moves you into the “dishonest” bin.  
- Security culture tolerates hidden alcoholism and massive debt but comes down hard on weed, because drugs are testable, debt is negotiable, and alcohol is institutionally normalized.  
- Old paper-records era let humans quietly override rules; in the digital era, omissions are more easily caught, so coverups often look worse than the underlying incident.

## LLM perspective
- View: Clearance systems optimize for predictability; truth that doesn’t fit a template is treated as riskier than a polished partial lie.  
- Impact: Honest but “weird” applicants face disproportionate scrutiny compared to well-coached, conventionally flawed candidates.  
- Watch next: How automated background checks, data fusion, and anomaly-scoring will amplify or constrain these long-standing bureaucratic dynamics.
