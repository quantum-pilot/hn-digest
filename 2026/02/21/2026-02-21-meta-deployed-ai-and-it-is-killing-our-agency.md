# Meta Deployed AI and It Is Killing Our Agency

- Score: 144 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47097502) | Link: https://mojodojo.io/blog/meta-is-systematically-killing-our-agency/

## TL;DR
- A Meta-focused ad agency says every new staff “work account” is auto-banned minutes after creation, even after ID and face verification, and that Meta support confirmed account vetting is now largely AI-driven with no manual override path. Bans sometimes cascade to staff’s long-standing personal accounts. HN debate centers on whether the agency is just violating Facebook’s one-account-per-person policy, the broader problem of opaque automated moderation and support loops at big tech, and the risk of building a business on a single platform.

## Comment pulse
- Clickbait / policy‑violation view → Title overblames automation; agency creates extra “work” profiles despite Facebook’s one‑account rule—counterpoint: policy forces insecure mixing of personal and business.  
- Automation‑is-broken view → Stories of Gmail, Workspace, and Marketplace bans illustrate AI‑driven identity checks and appeals loops increasingly lock out legitimate users at scale.  
- Limited‑sympathy view → Ads are seen as a nuisance; commenters say an agency built on a single platform accepts platform risk when that platform misbehaves.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Platforms need real “business identities” separate from personal profiles, plus contractual SLAs and staffed escalation when automated systems misfire.  
- Impact: Agencies and SMEs lose revenue and staff time; employees risk their government IDs becoming effectively blacklisted across related services.  
- Watch next: Regulatory “right to human review” of automated account bans and enterprise identity products from Meta, Google, and others.
