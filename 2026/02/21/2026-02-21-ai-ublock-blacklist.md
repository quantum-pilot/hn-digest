# AI uBlock Blacklist

- Score: 210 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47098582) | Link: https://github.com/alvi-se/ai-ublock-blacklist

### TL;DR
This GitHub project is a personal uBlock Origin filter list targeting websites the maintainer believes are fully AI‑generated “content farms.” It provides a subscription URL, explains why they dislike AI‑written answers (quality, safety, and lack of human perspective), and lists practical heuristics for spotting AI slop (overblown intros, vague “ultimate guides,” referral-heavy sites, huge post volumes, shallow content). Hacker News discussion centers on governance: false positives, “cry about it” removal policy, long‑term maintenance, and comparisons to broader AI blocklists.

### Comment pulse
- Blacklist governance is shaky → “Cry about it” FAQ, no clear removal path, domains change ownership; risks permanent mislabeling—counterpoint: it’s explicitly a personal list, users can fork.  
- Scope and alternatives → Praised as narrower, content‑farm‑focused versus the broad “Huge AI Blocklist”; others note existing uBlock AI‑widget lists and some alternatives going stale.  
- AI vs assistance → Worry about stigmatizing Grammarly/ESL writers; defenders say the target is industrial SEO farms, not individuals using light AI help.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as an opinionated, opt‑in filter, not a canonical list of “bad” sites or AI use.  
- Impact: Power users can de‑slop search results; wrongly listed sites may silently lose part of their audience.  
- Watch next: More formal appeal/expiry mechanisms; EasyList‑style projects integrating AI‑quality signals; tooling to semi‑automate content‑farm discovery.
