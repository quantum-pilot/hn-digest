# EU mandates replaceable batteries by 2027 (2023)

- Score: 212 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47098687) | Link: https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/new-law-more-sustainable-circular-and-safe-batteries-enters-force-2023-08-17_en

## TL;DR

The EU’s new Batteries Regulation governs the entire battery lifecycle: raw material sourcing, manufacturing, use, and recycling. It introduces carbon-footprint declarations, limits on hazardous substances, ambitious recycling and recovery targets, and due-diligence rules for supply chains. From 2027, portable batteries in electronic products must be user-replaceable, at least with standard tools, to extend device life and cut e‑waste. HN commenters welcome the pro-environment, anti–planned-obsolescence direction but highlight loopholes, design trade-offs, and broader unresolved right-to-repair issues.

## Comment pulse

- EU push is overdue → replaceable batteries fight e‑waste, exploitative dumping in poorer countries, and Big Tech’s planned obsolescence—counterpoint: modern batteries often outlast device performance anyway.  
- Scope is narrower than title implies → smartphones/tablets can be exempt via Ecodesign durability/repairability rules; “removable with tools” still allows glue and fragile glass.  
- Many want deeper ownership rights → calls for mandatory third‑party parts, anti‑DRM rules, unlockable bootloaders, or “abandonware” releases when support ends; others doubt EU will go that far.

## LLM perspective

- View: This is more about industrial policy and lifecycle accountability than nostalgia for swappable phone batteries.  
- Impact: Battery makers, EV OEMs, and recyclers must retool processes and documentation; consumer electronics see only incremental design changes.  
- Watch next: How Ecodesign criteria evolve, enforcement of digital battery passports, and whether right-to-repair legislation expands beyond batteries into software and security.
