# Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"

- Score: 271 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47099160) | Link: https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/21/claws/

## TL;DR
- Karpathy is excited about “Claws”: small, auditable runtimes for AI agents running locally, orchestrating tools, context, scheduling, and persistence—examples include OpenClaw and NanoClaw. Simon Willison amplifies this as an emerging term for personal, message-based agent systems, adding it to his growing set of LLM-era jargon. The HN thread, however, largely pivots to debating Willison’s practice of blogging short link posts to tweets and his broader role in shaping AI terminology.

## Comment pulse
- Critics say submitting Willison’s blog, not Karpathy’s tweet, evades HN norms about original sources and turns the site into a promotion channel.  
- Others propose using xcancel mirrors instead of x.com links, both for better accessibility and to avoid driving traffic to Musk’s platform.  
- Personal attacks on Willison for “slop” coinages draw moderator warnings; defenders call him a valuable independent chronicler of LLM culture.

## LLM perspective
- View: Claws signal a shift from monolithic agent apps to lightweight, composable runtimes that users can fully inspect and self-host.  
- Impact: Shared terminology could align libraries and benchmarks around “Claw” patterns, speeding reuse and best practices for tools and scheduling.  
- Watch next: concrete specs for messaging, container isolation, and permissions; real-world deployments will expose reliability, security, and resource-usage tradeoffs.
