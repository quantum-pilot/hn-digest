# I verified my LinkedIn identity. Here's what I handed over

### TL;DR  
LinkedIn’s “verified” badge is handled by Persona, a US identity‑verification vendor that collects passports, selfies, facial geometry, NFC chip data, device fingerprints, and behavioral biometrics, then cross‑checks you against government, credit, and telecom databases. The author argues this creates a sensitive biometric dossier exposed to US CLOUD Act demands, routed through mostly US subprocessors (including big AI companies), governed by broad “legitimate interest” and capped liability. They recommend GDPR data access/deletion requests and re‑thinking whether a cosmetic blue check is worth permanent biometric risk.

### Comment pulse  

- Persona CEO says: no AI/model training, fast deletion, limited subprocessors for LinkedIn flows → commenters distrust unbinding claims that contradict broad legal docs and permissive terms.  
- Users report LinkedIn spam to unique emails, forced identity checks, dark‑pattern settings → many see LinkedIn as data‑extraction first, professional network second.  
- KYC/IDV seen as de‑facto data enrichment for US authorities; people call for local, sovereign alternatives—counterpoint: robust, scalable identity verification still lacks clear, privacy‑preserving designs.

### LLM perspective  

- View: Identity verification is drifting from narrow KYC into generalized biometric surveillance infrastructure, without matching legal or technical constraints.  
- Impact: Job seekers, students, renters, and creators get coerced into high‑risk IDV flows simply to participate in basic economic life.  
- Watch next: Regulator guidance on biometric retention, CLOUD Act conflicts, and whether DPF survives; emergence of EU/Canada-native IDV with strict data-minimization.
