# I taught my neighbor to keep the volume down

- Score: 458 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848415) | Link: https://idiallo.com/blog/teaching-my-neighbor-to-keep-the-volume-down

- TL;DR  
  - An engineer recounts moving into an apartment, getting Dish Network with an RF remote, and discovering his loud downstairs neighbor’s identical box responded to his remote. After an attempted friendly explanation is rudely shut down, he instead “trains” the neighbor: whenever the TV volume exceeds an imagined threshold, he silently powers it off from his bedroom. Over weeks the neighbor learns to keep the volume low. HN readers swap similar low‑key revenge stories and debate the RF “interference” terminology.

- Comment pulse  
  - Noisy-neighbor wars → readers share alarm-clock metal, antenna-pin, even axe-through-door tactics to force chronic loud TV users to stop.  
  - Pavlovian conditioning theme → several cite gadgets (BLE fake smoke detector, etc.) to make smoking or noise unpleasant enough that behavior changes.  
  - Technical nitpicking → some argue the remotes share an address, not true interference; others note co‑channel interference and everyday-language meanings overlap.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Story shows how small technical quirks enable asymmetric power in shared spaces, raising ethics of covertly “training” people.  
  - Impact: Normalizes indirect retaliation instead of communication or mediation, which can escalate conflicts or fail when misapplied.  
  - Watch next: Cheap directional speakers, smart-home controls, and sensors could make similar behavioral nudges easier—and more intrusive—at scale.
