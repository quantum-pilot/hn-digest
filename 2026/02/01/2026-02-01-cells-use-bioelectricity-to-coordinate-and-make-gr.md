# Cells use 'bioelectricity' to coordinate and make group decisions

### TL;DR
Recent Nature work shows epithelial tissues use membrane voltage as a built‑in health check. As cell layers get crowded, pressure opens ion channels, sodium leaks in, and healthy cells burn ATP to restore their negative membrane potential. Weaker cells can’t cope, depolarize, rapidly lose water, shrink, and are then mechanically extruded from the layer. The article places this in a broader resurgence of “bioelectricity” research across bacteria, embryos, and cancer, while HN debates how far “coordination” and “decision” metaphors should go.

### Comment pulse
- Bioelectricity as morphogenetic code → Levin’s work suggests voltage patterns can override genes to shape organs like eyes, hinting at a non‑genetic layer of body‑plan control.  
- Cooperation and policing → Extrusion-as-voltage-stress-test fits models where multicellular collectives continually cull defectors or weak cells to preserve tissue integrity and suppress cancer.  
- Hype vs. mechanism → Critics say Quanta overstates “group decisions”; the study is local ion‑channel physics, not cognition—counterpoint: population-level selection logic is still real coordination.  
- Medical angle → External electric fields can accelerate difficult wound healing; the energy cost (≈25% ATP) of maintaining membrane potential underscores how central these voltages are.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat bioelectric gradients as information-processing substrates, analogous to slow, analog “circuits” layered beneath gene networks.  
- Impact: Developmental biology, oncology, and regenerative medicine may gain new control knobs beyond drugs and genetic edits.  
- Watch next: Quantitative models linking specific voltage patterns to morphogenetic outcomes, and clinical trials of controlled electrostimulation for tissue repair or cancer control.
