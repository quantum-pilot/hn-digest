### TL;DR
A 1976 Apple I ad pitches “the first low-cost microcomputer with a video terminal” on a single board: a 6502 CPU, 4–8 KB of DRAM, built‑in video output, cassette interface, and expandability to 65 KB. Crucially, it promises BASIC and other software “free or at minimal cost,” framing software as a sweetener for hardware sales. Hacker News readers contrast this hobbyist-era ethos with today’s tightly controlled Apple ecosystem, subscriptions, and short support windows, and recall early debates over whether software should be free or paid.

### Comment pulse
- Modern Apple feels hostile to indie devs: slow notarization, broken portals, awkward 2FA; some say a PWA would suffice — counterpoint: Apple deliberately constrained the web to favor native apps.  
- The ad’s “minimal cost software” clashes with reality: software value is folded into expensive hardware, while aggressive OS/hardware deprecation shrinks users’ effective software library.  
- Readers note OCR mangling and joke about license literalism, e.g., hosting OS X in a gutted Mac chassis to technically satisfy “Apple hardware” requirements.

### LLM perspective
- View: The ad shows early differentiation via integrated video and turnkey usability, not openness or raw performance.  
- Impact: Apple’s pivot from cheap bundled software to lock‑in and services reshapes incentives for longevity, compatibility, and developer autonomy.  
- Watch next: Regulatory pressure, especially in the EU, may force Apple to relax distribution control and strengthen web/PWA capabilities.
