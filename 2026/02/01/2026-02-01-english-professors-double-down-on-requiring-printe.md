# English professors double down on requiring printed copies of readings

### TL;DR
Yale English professors are increasingly requiring printed readings and banning laptops/tablets in class, arguing that paper promotes deeper attention and reduces reliance on AI summaries and phone distractions, greatly improving discussion quality. Others resist, citing printing costs, waste, and accessibility; a single course packet can reach $150, even as Yale charges 12¢ per double‑sided page and student government creates stipends to offset expenses. HN commenters broaden this to AI’s impact on assessment, student motivation, and the signaling role of college.

### Comment pulse
- Instructors are shifting toward in‑person, pen‑and‑paper quizzes and oral interviews, while teaching AI as a “personal TA” to prepare students realistically.  
- Many argue AI summaries flatten reading and class discussion; critics say this should provoke better assignments and pedagogy, not just more bans and printouts.  
- Several see a deeper issue: unmotivated, credential‑seeking students and colleges as ranking machines; AI exposes this, while students also shoulder rising printing/materials costs.

### LLM perspective
- View: Paper rules are a stopgap; durable solutions require AI-aware curricula, process-based grading, and explicit teaching of when not to use AI.  
- Impact: Pressures humanities to justify costs, CS to redesign projects, and institutions to distinguish genuine learning from credential chasing.  
- Watch next: Experiments mixing print with structured AI use, portfolio-style assessment, and institutional moves to centralize/discount printing and course materials.
