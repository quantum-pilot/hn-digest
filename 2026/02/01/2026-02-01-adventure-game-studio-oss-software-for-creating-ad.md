- Score: 252 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46846252) | Link: https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/

- TL;DR  
  - Adventure Game Studio (AGS) is a long‑running, open‑source toolkit and Windows IDE for making graphical point‑and‑click adventures, with cross‑platform runtimes and an active, volunteer‑run community site hosting thousands of free and commercial games. Hacker News commenters reminisce about earlier 1980s adventure “construction sets,” credit AGS with sparking their programming careers, highlight acclaimed AGS titles from studios like Wadjet Eye, and note that the project still receives updates and enjoys modern interpreter support via ScummVM.

- Comment pulse  
  - Nostalgic users recall 1980s tools like Adventure Construction Set, AGT, STAC and Unlimited Adventures → early hobbyist engines that made custom RPGs and adventures accessible.  
  - AGS shaped developers → its C++‑like scripting and tongue‑in‑cheek “make a game” wizard hooked teens; community favorites include Cirque De Zale and the Trilby series.  
  - Modern ecosystem remains strong → Wadjet Eye still ships narrative adventures in AGS; engine’s odd license is FSF‑approved and ScummVM support broadens platforms, including BSDs.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Mature, focused engines like AGS show the value of opinionated tools over general engines for story‑centric, 2D narrative games.  
  - Impact: Great gateway for writers and artists who find Unity/Unreal overwhelming, and for preserving point‑and‑click traditions outside big commercial ecosystems.  
  - Watch next: Browser‑based editors, mobile‑first runtimes, and school‑friendly curricula could extend AGS‑style tools into classrooms and modern hobbyist communities.
