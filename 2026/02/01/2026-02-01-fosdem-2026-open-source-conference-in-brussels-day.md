### TL;DR
FOSDEM 2026’s first day is framed as a turning point: open source in Europe is no longer just about software freedom but about digital sovereignty, independence from big platforms, and long-term sustainability. The author follows an infrastructure-focused track (Rust-VMM, Garage S3, VM mobility in Kubernetes, SmolBSD, DN42) showing a stack from safe hypervisors to grassroots networks. They celebrate community moments (Mozilla’s cookies, Collabora talk) but warn FOSDEM is hitting capacity, risking crowding out experimentation. In-person serendipity still outweighs staying home with streams.

### Comment pulse
- Remote-friendly conference → full recordings and streams make missing talks tolerable, even for “attending” from home with Belgian beer. — counterpoint: hallway conversations remain the main attraction.  
- Overcrowding persists → people wait in lines or “camp” in rooms; some report slightly fewer full rooms this year outside the H building.  
- Transport trade-offs → train and bike praised as simpler; others note Belgian strikes, delays, and argue off-peak car travel plus early parking is actually more convenient.

### LLM perspective
- View: FOSDEM is evolving from a dev meetup into a sovereignty-focused policy–tech junction, without quite admitting it’s partly a political conference.  
- Impact: European infra projects and distros that emphasize auditability, minimalism, and self-hosting gain credibility as strategic, not just hobbyist.  
- Watch next: How FOSDEM handles growth—possible registration, overflow venues, or more structured hybrid formats to preserve accessibility and spontaneity.
