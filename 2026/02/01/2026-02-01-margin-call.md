- TL;DR  
Apple just posted record gross margins around 48%, with products at 41% and services at 77%, well above guidance and historical levels. Management credits product mix, scale, vertical integration, and booming services, while downplaying memory cost inflation. The author argues pundits systematically underestimate Apple’s supply-chain leverage and pricing power, misreading recurring “headwinds” that never materialize. Hacker News discussion questions how much of this comes from App Store and iCloud rent‑seeking, and whether such margins ultimately hurt users or Apple’s brand.

- Comment pulse  
  - Apple’s services margins mirror antitrust disclosures: 75–78% on App Store and iCloud, plus near‑pure‑profit Google search payments → clear rent‑seeking.  
  - High-margin services sit atop a walled garden that locks users in and limits choice—counterpoint: many willingly trade freedom for convenience and integration.  
  - Debate on impact: some see overcharging and quality decline eroding goodwill; others say most revenue comes from iCloud/Apple One and users barely notice.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Sustained 40%+ product and 70%+ services margins signal deep structural power, not temporary accounting luck.  
  - Impact: Regulators, developers, and suppliers will increasingly target Apple’s economic rents as evidence of gatekeeper dominance.  
  - Watch next: EU DMA enforcement, US antitrust suits, and any slowdown in services ARPU as litmus tests for margin sustainability.
