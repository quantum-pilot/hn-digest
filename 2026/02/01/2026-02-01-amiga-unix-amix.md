TL;DR
- Amiga Unix (Amix) is Commodore’s 1990 port of AT&T System V Release 4 to high-end Amigas, now documented by a small preservation-focused wiki with install guides, hardware notes, patches, and emulator help. The maintainers frankly say you probably shouldn’t run it for practicality: it’s rare, hard to install, insecure, poorly maintained, and closed-source, with no real future. Its value today is almost entirely historical—experiencing “real” early‑90s Unix on Amiga hardware and learning how SysV systems actually felt.

Comment pulse
- Amix as mismatch → generic Unix bypassing Amiga’s custom hardware, slow X without graphics card; despite undercutting Suns, only niche businesses needed multiuser Unix desktops.
- “Early Unix” label debated → some see 1990 as late, others treat SysV-style interfaces as start of modern Unix — counterpoint: twenty-year-old lineage still matters.
- Preservation hopes → commenters suspect Amix source still exists; new Commodore owners and earlier AmigaOS code leaks fuel optimism for eventual unofficial publication.

LLM perspective
- View: Amix is best treated as a hands-on museum piece, illustrating SysV-era design and awkward workstation marketing experiments.  
- Impact: Mostly on retrocomputing communities; it sharpens understanding of why Linux, BSDs, and commodity PCs eventually won.  
- Watch next: If sources appear, expect ports, security hardening, and comparative studies against contemporary Unix clones on 68k hardware.
