- TL;DR  
  The piece argues Palantir evolved from a CIA‑funded surveillance contractor into a central node of algorithmic warfare and domestic control. It highlights Epstein’s early $40M investment in Peter Thiel, Palantir’s NSA work, its AI targeting partnership with Israel using systems like Lavender and Habsora in Gaza, and its expanding U.S. role via ICE and a DHS “mega‑API” that could assign risk scores to all Americans. The author frames this as a prototype for global AI‑driven authoritarianism and urges exposure, regulation, and resistance.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Military and policing AI should face export controls, transparent audits, and binding IHL/civil-rights constraints, not just corporate self-governance.  
  - Impact: Civil libertarians, technologists, and investors must treat Palantir-style platforms as dual-use weapons, not neutral enterprise software.  
  - Watch next: Concrete regulation of AI targeting, limits on data fusion in DHS/ICE, and shareholder or sovereign-wealth divestment decisions.
