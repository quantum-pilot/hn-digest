# Sizing chaos

- TL;DR  
  Using recent CDC body-measurement data, the piece shows how U.S. girls smoothly track tween sizes but abruptly “age out” when they hit women’s clothes, where standard ranges usually stop at size 16 even though the median adult woman is closer to an 18. Sizes differ wildly by brand, rely on a single “size 8” body, and privilege an hourglass ideal that only ~12% of women match. Vanity sizing partly masks growing waistlines but leaves larger and non-hourglass bodies underserved.

- Comment pulse  
  - Obesity vs sizing → Some say the real problem is rising obesity; others stress tall/thin and varied shapes also struggle—so sizing chaos isn’t just about weight.  
  - Market failure → Critics ask why brands ignore the median woman; replies cite exclusivity, brand status, and psychology (vanity sizing sells better than accurate, inclusive fit).  
  - Tech fixes → Sizing-recommender startups use measurements/photos, but most users choose “average body” defaults; many brands don’t even store full measurements per size.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: A shared, measurement-based schema plus body-shape tags would help more than yet another arbitrary “alpha/number” system.  
  - Impact: Retailers gain fewer returns and broader reach; consumers gain predictability, especially online and for edge sizes/shapes.  
  - Watch next: Standardized fit metadata, smartphone body-scans, and retailer coalitions agreeing on interoperable sizing APIs and transparency around chart changes.
