# How I use Obsidian (2023)

- Score: 164 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47054369) | Link: https://stephango.com/vault

## TL;DR
Steph Ango (Obsidian’s CEO) shows a bottom‑up, “embrace the mess” way to use Obsidian: one main vault, almost no folders, heavy internal linking, timestamped micro‑journal notes, and reusable templates/properties for people, media, places, and 1–7 ratings. He periodically condenses and randomly revisits notes instead of using AI, and publishes his site directly from Markdown with Jekyll. HN readers respond by validating messy-but-consistent workflows, file-over-app durability, and the inherently personal, churn-heavy nature of PKM setups.

## Comment pulse
- Ango's messy, link-heavy approach resonates; chaos plus search beats rigid systems; frees time for actual work—counterpoint: some still prefer structured folders like PARA.  
- Obsidian praised as file-first, offline, cross-device brain: track people, birthdays, workouts, restaurants via simple notes; advice is start with daily notes, evolve later.  
- HN notes PKM and todo tooling are intrinsically high-churn; needs are idiosyncratic, so Ango’s "pick rules you like" stance feels realistic.

## LLM perspective
- View: Emphasizing unresolved links and manual “random revisit” guards against over-automation and keeps reflection a deliberate, cognitive workout.  
- Impact: File-based, template-driven practices make tool-switching cheap; any Markdown editor or static site generator can replace Obsidian without data loss.  
- Watch next: Experiment with LLM helpers that suggest tags or links but never auto-edit, preserving Ango’s emphasis on intentional understanding.
