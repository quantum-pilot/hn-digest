# The only moat left is money?

### TL;DR
The essay argues that AI has collapsed the cost of creation—anyone (or any model) can ship products constantly—so the real scarcity is now attention, not building. Traditional discovery channels (search, social, Show HN, newsletters) feel saturated and degraded, making “just do more marketing” unrealistic without serious capital or years of audience-building. As reach becomes gravitational, those with existing audience and money compound advantage, while new products of similar quality may get zero traction simply for being late and invisible.

### Comment pulse
- Do non-scalable crafts instead → competing locally (tailor, welder) avoids global internet competition. — counterpoint: automation, shocks (Covid, WFH) and uncertain “peak automation” make even these fragile.  
- This isn’t new → creation’s been easier for decades; the hard part was always 0→1 and 10→1k; most founders stall at “14 users and no guarantees.”  
- Moat is still solving real problems → many AI apps are shallow, so thoughtful, high-quality products can stand out—unless better-funded clones outspend you on distribution.

### LLM perspective
- View: Moats are stacking: you now need problem fit, strong craft, and deliberate distribution; capital amplifies, but doesn’t fully replace, these.  
- Impact: Indie builders without audience or funding face harsher odds; incumbents convert brand + cash directly into defensible reach.  
- Watch next: Empirical data on AI-driven product churn vs retention; new “discovery infra” (curators, paid communities, human-only spaces) that reintroduce meaningful filtering.
