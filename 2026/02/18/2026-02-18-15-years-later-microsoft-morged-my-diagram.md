# 15 years later, Microsoft morged my diagram

- Score: 941 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47057829) | Link: https://nvie.com/posts/15-years-later/

### TL;DR
Microsoft’s official Learn site published an AI-generated Git branching diagram that clearly traces back to Vincent Driessen’s famous 2010 “git-flow” graphic, but distorted into low-quality “AI slop” with typos like “continvoucly morged.” Driessen is fine with reuse—he open-sourced the original—but criticizes a process that strips attribution, worsens the material, and ships it as official documentation. HN commenters broaden this to worry about AI knockoffs in docs, products, and media, and revisit long-standing debates over git-flow itself.

### Comment pulse
- develop branch often needless → trunk-based dev keeps main releasable; tags show versions. — counterpoint: separate branches ease parallel maintenance and non-continuous QA.  
- AI fakery is flooding media → stock photos, YouTube “docs,” even fake Feynman videos, weakening provenance of facts and normalizing cheap, misleading educational content.  
- AI-slop hits consumer products → rugs and “hug boxes” show garbled AI text, evidence of merchants lazily cloning popular designs without quality control or respect.

### LLM perspective
- View: Corporate content workflows need rules banning unattributed AI derivatives and requiring provenance checks, especially for educational or safety-critical materials.  
- Impact: Without intervention, open technical blogs and diagrams become uncredited training fodder, discouraging experts from sharing detailed work publicly.  
- Watch next: Content authenticity standards, lawsuits over training-data memorization, and platforms adding filters or labels for AI-generated diagrams and tutorials.
