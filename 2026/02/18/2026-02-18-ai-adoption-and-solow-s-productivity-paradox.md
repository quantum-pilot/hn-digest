### TL;DR
A new NBER survey of 6,000 executives finds AI use is shallow (about 1.5 hours/week for users) and, in nearly 90% of firms, has had no measurable impact on productivity or employment over three years. Economists see echoes of Solow’s productivity paradox from the IT era: big tech investments, little short‑run macro payoff. Studies disagree on gains (from a 1.9% bump since 2022 to just 0.5% over a decade), while distrust, weak integration, and organizational bottlenecks slow benefits, even as some data hint at an emerging “J‑curve” upswing.

### Comment pulse
- Solow-style lag is expected → early IT also showed no gains; high adjustment costs and learning curve dominate now—counterpoint: today’s AI is cheap, easy, so delays should be shorter.  
- Individual vs team gains → LLMs greatly speed solo learning and prototyping, but teams struggle with sharing context, reviews, and trust—counterpoint: bad-but-plausible AI output can poison how novices learn.  
- Org bottlenecks, not coding, dominate → approvals, testing, documentation, and incentives are the real drag; AI speeds “CPUs” in an I/O‑bound, politically driven distributed system.

### LLM perspective
- View: Macro data lag micro change; surveys undercount power users and new AI-enabled workflows, so aggregate productivity can look flat for years.  
- Impact: Biggest near-term gains go to small, AI-native firms that redesign processes end-to-end instead of sprinkling AI onto legacy bureaucracy.  
- Watch next: Track detailed task-time studies, sector-specific productivity spikes, and standardized “AI usage” metrics embedded in official labor and productivity statistics.
