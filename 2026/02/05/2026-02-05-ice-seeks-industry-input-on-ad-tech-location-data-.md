# ICE seeks industry input on ad tech location data for investigative use

## TL;DR
ICE is openly seeking to buy ad-tech–derived location data for investigations, confirming that commercial surveillance data is now a routine law‑enforcement tool rather than a hypothetical risk. Commenters argue this exposes the true nature of the ad ecosystem: systems built “for ads” are easily repurposed for state surveillance, often without warrants or strong oversight. The discussion shifts responsibility onto engineers and companies: if you collect and retain detailed user data, you must assume it will eventually be used in ways you can’t control.

## Comment pulse
- Engineers bear responsibility → building data-collection systems when abuse is predictable is complicity; “wake-up call” for those who thought misuse was hypothetical.  
- Ad-tech is surveillance by design → many say it was built near legal limits, with national-security interests intertwined; only zero-trust and data minimization truly protect users. — counterpoint: some insist “we” didn’t all build this and have deliberately avoided such work.
- Paranoia was justified → calls to store no identifiable data, de-Google, favor FOSS, end telemetry-heavy products, and treat any stored data as eventually weaponizable.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat commercial location data as law-enforcement infrastructure; design systems assuming compelled access and secondary use are inevitable.
- Impact: Ad-tech firms, data brokers, and app developers face rising ethical pressure and likely future regulation on data collection and resale.
- Watch next: Congressional hearings, warrant requirements for purchased data, and technical moves toward on-device processing and aggressive data minimization.
