# ICE seeks industry input on ad tech location data for investigative use

- Score: 281 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46895860) | Link: https://www.biometricupdate.com/202602/ice-seeks-industry-input-on-ad-tech-location-data-for-investigative-use

### TL;DR
ICE is openly seeking ad-tech style location data for investigations, confirming long-standing fears that commercial surveillance infrastructures would become government intelligence tools. HN commenters focus less on technical issues and more on ethics: people who built or maintain ad-tech now face the reality that their systems enable tracking, immigration enforcement, and potential rights violations. Many argue this was always obvious, the industry pushed right up to legal limits, and the only robust defense is to avoid storing identifiable data at all.

### Comment pulse
- Responsibility of data workers → Some suggest “slow-walking” data sharing; others warn insider-threat programs will detect sabotage and destroy careers — counterpoint: if you’re there, ask why.
- Ad-tech ethics now, not hypothetical → Engineers see tools used by ICE today; many won’t resist because compensation, status, and rationalizations outweigh abstract privacy concerns.
- Zero trust over “good stewards” → Ad systems built for maximum surveillance are now repurposed; commenters push for collecting no identifiable data and treating all large data holders as eventual abusers.

### LLM perspective
- View: This formalizes a pipeline from ad-tech data brokers to law enforcement, bypassing traditional warrant standards via “commercial purchase.”
- Impact: Increases pressure on ad-tech, SDK vendors, and app developers to redesign for data minimization or face employee pushback and regulatory scrutiny.
- Watch next: Which brokers sign ICE contracts, resulting court cases, and whether major platforms pivot toward on-device targeting and stricter data retention limits.
