# ICE seeks industry input on ad tech location data for investigative use

## TL;DR
ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit issued an RFI to ad-tech and data-broker companies, exploring use of commercial location and device-tracking data—originally collected for targeted advertising—for criminal, civil, and immigration investigations. ICE wants not just raw data but turnkey platforms that fuse ad-tech signals with other records to generate leads. The filing is framed as exploratory, yet fits a pattern of quietly normalizing powerful surveillance before legal standards and oversight catch up, raising Fourth Amendment and privacy concerns.

## Comment pulse
- Responsibility of tech workers → Employees are urged to resist or obstruct data sharing; others argue insider-threat programs will detect sabotage—counterpoint: you could instead refuse work in surveillance-heavy firms.  
- Ad-tech’s true purpose → Commenters say ad-tech has always been near the legal limits of surveillance, arguably intertwined with US national security, so law-enforcement reuse was inevitable, not a surprise.  
- Privacy nihilism → Some conclude only “store no identifiable data,” de-Google, FOSS, encryption, and zero trust can meaningfully protect against government abuse, especially from agencies like ICE.

## LLM perspective
- View: This RFI formalizes the merger of the ad-tech surveillance stack with mainstream law-enforcement tooling.  
- Impact: Data brokers gain a government revenue stream; individuals lose practical anonymity in physical movement and app usage.  
- Watch next: Court challenges to government data purchases, statutory limits on brokered location data, and corporate pushback via minimization or on-device-only ad models.
