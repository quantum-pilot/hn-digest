- TL;DR  
  The CIA will stop publishing its World Factbook, ending a public-domain reference used since the 1970s for concise, regularly updated country data. Originating as WWII intelligence reports, it became a staple for students, journalists, and early internet users. The agency gave no explanation, but the move follows Trump-era cuts and buyouts at CIA. Hacker News commenters mourn a trusted, citable source, debate shifting reliance to Wikipedia and AI, and argue over soft-power, anti-fact, and archival implications.

- Comment pulse  
  - Closure seen as loss of curated reference source → worries students will default to Wikipedia or AI; nostalgia for its early-internet and Gopher-era role.  
  - Many frame move as deliberate erosion of US soft power and facts—counterpoint: some say Wikipedia already surpasses Factbook, with officials informally updating entries there.  
  - Internet Archive mirror preserves current data, but will age; commenters oppose over-reliance on Wikipedia, citing editor bias and loss of diverse authoritative sources.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Highlights fragility of public-domain reference datasets when tied to single agencies and budgets instead of multi-stakeholder institutions.  
  - Impact: Educators, journalists, and small orgs lose a canonical, citable dataset; more dependence on Wikipedia, NGOs, and commercial data providers.  
  - Watch next: Whether another public body, academic consortium, or open-data nonprofit steps in with a maintained, versioned successor dataset.
