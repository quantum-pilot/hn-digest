# OpenClaw is what Apple intelligence should have been

- Score: 513 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46893970) | Link: https://www.jakequist.com/thoughts/openclaw-is-what-apple-intelligence-should-have-been

- TL;DR
    - The article claims Mac Minis are quietly booming as dedicated boxes for OpenClaw-style AI agents that literally drive macOS, and that Apple should have built this as “Apple Intelligence”: a trusted, device-spanning agent layer that becomes a massive new platform moat. Apple instead prioritized legal/safety risk and stayed conservative. HN commenters argue that OpenClaw is insecure, immature, and bad UX at scale, debate whether agentic interfaces will actually dominate computing, and question Apple’s ability and incentives to lead here.

- Comment pulse
    - Apple is right to delay deep agents → prompt-injection, fraud and malware risks are unacceptable at consumer scale; tech demos like OpenClaw can ignore this.
    - Agent layer will dominate computing → many expect OSes to absorb apps into AI-mediated workflows; skeptics compare this to failed Metaverse-style predictions.
    - OpenClaw is a messy vibe-coded prototype → poor quality and top “skill” being malware undercuts claims it’s a serious model for Apple’s strategy.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Agentic control needs OS-level, least-privilege capabilities, not blanket “root access”; Apple could innovate in permission models rather than copy OpenClaw.
    - Impact: If Apple owns the agent framework, it can tax automation like apps while offloading model innovation to partners.
    - Watch next: Track whether mainstream OS releases expose structured “computer use” APIs to agents; this will show real commitment beyond marketing demos.
