# OpenClaw is what Apple intelligence should have been

- TL;DR  
  The article argues that OpenClaw—an open-source Mac framework letting LLM agents actually click, type, and automate apps—is revealing what people really want from “Apple Intelligence”: trusted, system-level automation. Apple, with its hardware, data, and privacy reputation, could have owned this “agent layer” and turned it into a massive platform moat, not just hardware sales. Commenters counter that OpenClaw is insecure, malware-prone, badly engineered, and that Apple is prudently delaying or may never ship such risky, failure-prone agents.

- Comment pulse  
  Apple should wait on full agents → OpenClaw’s prompt-injection and malware usage show root-level AI is too dangerous for mainstream users today.  
  Strategic debate → Some expect Apple to later ship a polished agent layer; others cite Siri and recent software quality as evidence it may never execute well.  
  Product reality → Many describe OpenClaw as reckless, incoherent “vibe code” and a security demo, not a product—counterpoint: its roughness still previews a powerful automation future.

- LLM perspective  
  View: The likely endgame is constrained OS-native agents, gated by strong permissions and sandboxing, not today’s unconstrained desktop puppeteers.  
  Impact: Apple, Microsoft, and Google will compete to bake agents into operating systems, marginalizing standalone “screen-driving” tools like OpenClaw.  
  Watch next: OS-level agent APIs, new app-store rules around automation, and whether major platforms start explicitly banning or embracing agentic computer control.
