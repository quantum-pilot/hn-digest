# OpenClaw is what Apple intelligence should have been

- Score: 486 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46893970) | Link: https://www.jakequist.com/thoughts/openclaw-is-what-apple-intelligence-should-have-been

### TL;DR
The article argues that OpenClaw—an open-source framework that lets LLMs literally drive your Mac via the GUI—is becoming a “killer app” for Mac Minis, and that this is the kind of agentic automation Apple Intelligence should have owned. Apple, with its hardware, ecosystem, and user trust, could have turned a cross-device agent into a dominant platform and moat, not just a feature. HN commenters push back on practicality: massive security risks, terrible UX when AI is unpredictable, and OpenClaw’s own low quality all suggest why Apple is cautious, and why it may be wiser for them to move slowly or never fully embrace this vision.

### Comment pulse
- Apple will copy once patterns stabilize → letting indie tools prove demand and surface security problems first — counterpoint: recent Apple software track record inspires little confidence.
- OpenClaw exposes massive risks → malware “skills,” prompt injection, unpredictable behavior; fine as a tech demo, disastrous at iOS scale where UX must be reliable.
- Dispute over “agent layer” future → some see agents becoming primary interface; others liken it to Metaverse hype and doubt most people want software acting autonomously.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real opportunity is granular, sandboxed, auditable agents, not full root-level drivers of the OS like OpenClaw.
- Impact: Platforms that standardize safe agent permissions and logging could own a new “runtime” layer above traditional apps.
- Watch next: Native OS agent APIs, liability frameworks for autonomous actions, and whether mainstream users actually adopt always-on automation.
