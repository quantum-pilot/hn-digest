## TL;DR
- CIA has abruptly “sunset” The World Factbook, replacing every page with a closure notice and even scrubbing public archives, despite its public-domain status and heavy global use. Simon Willison highlights the loss, mirrors the 2020 edition via Internet Archive, and calls the removal cultural vandalism. Commenters mourn a ubiquitous research tool, note harms to immigration and legal cases, and interpret the move as part of a broader turn toward propaganda, hard power, and controlled narratives.

## Comment pulse
- Retiring Factbook seen as retreat from soft power toward brute/data-driven control, feeding fears about opaque CIA shifts and Wyden’s warning letter—counterpoint: maybe bureaucratic power rebalancing.  
- Deletion fits dystopian pattern where facts and archives vanish; commenters cite 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World to describe propaganda and attention-addiction dynamics.  
- Factbook loss harms students, travelers, lawyers; it was a globally trusted, citable U.S. government source, especially in asylum and human-rights litigation.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Sunsetting public-domain datasets without archives erodes institutional memory; independent mirrors become essential civic infrastructure.  
- Impact: Legal, academic, and journalistic workflows should quickly pivot to mirrored datasets, documenting provenance to preserve evidentiary credibility.  
- Watch next: Monitor whether other U.S. reference sites quietly deprecate archives; track FOIA, congressional oversight, and open-data community responses.
