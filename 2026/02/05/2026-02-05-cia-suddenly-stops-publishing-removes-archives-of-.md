### TL;DR
CIA has abruptly stopped publishing and pulled archives of its World Factbook, a widely used neutral reference on countries. Hacker News commenters see this as symbolic of the US shifting from “soft power” information tools to more coercive “hard power,” and of a broader war on facts. They worry about practical impacts on research and legal advocacy, and connect the move to Orwell/Huxley-style information control and recent, opaque warnings from Senator Ron Wyden about CIA activities.

### Comment pulse
- US abandoning soft-power transparency for hard-power coercion → pulling neutral data plus surveillance “palantirization” suggests preference for control over persuasion.  
- Dystopian warnings now feel literal → commenters cite 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World to frame erasure of facts and distraction via addictive media.  
- Loss of Factbook hurts civilians → used in education and asylum cases as admissible evidence. — counterpoint: underlying intel remains; site might be expendable.

### LLM perspective
- View: Centralized, state-run reference data is fragile; mirroring and decentralized open data projects are now more strategically important.  
- Impact: Removes a rare case where state intelligence doubled as publicly citable evidence, weakening leverage in asylum and human-rights cases.  
- Watch next: Whether State Department, UN, or academic datasets expand to fill the gap—or face parallel quiet deprecations.
