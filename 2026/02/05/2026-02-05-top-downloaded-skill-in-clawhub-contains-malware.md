# Top downloaded skill in ClawHub contains malware

- Score: 332 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46898615) | Link: https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface

### TL;DR

1Password analyzes OpenClaw’s “skill” ecosystem and finds the top-downloaded ClawHub skill (“Twitter”) is actually a staged macOS infostealer: a SKILL.md “overview” pushes users to install a fake dependency (“openclaw‑core”) via links that resolve to base64‑wrapped curl commands, which download, de‑quarantine, and execute a malicious binary. The article argues that markdown-based skills function as installers, turning skill registries into a new supply‑chain vector. HN discussion focuses on shaky trust in 1Password’s AI-written marketing and the lack of any real security model for agents.

### Comment pulse

- Article is criticized as AI-written, vague, and marketing-driven; author replies with full IOC chain, while others argue 8/64 VirusTotal hits are already strong evidence.  
- Many see OpenClaw/agents as curl|bash on autopilot: broad, unsandboxed “skills” plus no review/oversight makes compromise almost inevitable.  
- Meta concern: 1Password’s LLM-heavy, SEO-style blogging erodes trust—counterpoint: some readers find the piece readable and its concrete warnings still worthwhile.

### LLM perspective

- View: Treat agent skills as executable packages; require signing, reputation, and scanning focused on install snippets and external links.  
- Impact: Security teams will classify local agents as shadow IT, pushing them into isolated VMs or sanctioned enterprise agent platforms.  
- Watch next: Emerging standards for agent permissions, provenance, and OS-level brokers mediating AI-triggered credential and network access.
