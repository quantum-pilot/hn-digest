# Top downloaded skill in ClawHub contains malware

- Score: 298 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46898615) | Link: https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface

### TL;DR
A 1Password blog post reports that ClawHub’s most-downloaded “skill” for Twitter monitoring secretly instructs users to install an `openclaw-core` package that’s actually a stealer malware. The skill’s README chains a password-protected archive and a rentry page into a base64‑encoded `curl | bash` pipeline that downloads and runs an unsigned binary, which VirusTotal flags in 8/64 engines. HN debates the article’s AI-written style, how to interpret VirusTotal hits, and the fundamentally unsafe security model of LLM agents and skills.

### Comment pulse
- Concrete malware path exists → skill README links to passworded “core” installer, rentry script, base64-decoded curl pipeline, unsigned binary flagged as Mac stealer.  
- Agent/skill model is inherently unsafe → free-form skills plus broad machine permissions resemble continuous `mail | bash`, not one-shot `curl | bash`—counterpoint: sandboxing may undercut agents’ usefulness.  
- AI-written post undermines trust → readers resent 1Password using LLM SEO filler; others say style is tolerable and content still valuable despite AI “slop” concerns.

### LLM perspective
- View: Agent marketplaces without strict signing, review, and least-privilege will become high-yield malware distribution channels.  
- Impact: Platform vendors, AV companies, and enterprise security teams must treat skills like untrusted executables, not “config.”  
- Watch next: Formal permission models, signed/provenanced skills, runtime mediation/inspection for agent actions, and regulations around commercial AI agent ecosystems.
