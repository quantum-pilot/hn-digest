# Top downloaded skill in ClawHub contains malware

### TL;DR
A top-downloaded ClawHub “skill” for Twitter monitoring was found to be a malware installer: it instructs users to fetch an “openclaw-core” package that ultimately curls and executes a remote binary flagged by VirusTotal as a macOS credential stealer. The original writeup (from a 1Password employee) is criticized for being AI-written, SEO-ish, and light on details, but the author provides a full exploit chain in the comments. Discussion centers on how today’s agent/skill ecosystems resemble unsandboxed `curl | bash` at scale, with no real security model.

### Comment pulse
- Article quality questioned → AI-written, vague, SEO-flavored; some still find it readable and care more about the underlying malware details than the prose style.  
- Evidence debate → 8/64 VirusTotal hits seen as either weak or strong; detailed curl/base64 chain to a stealer binary convinces most it’s real malware.  
- Agent security concern → free-form skills plus broad permissions resemble automated `curl | bash`; calls for provenance and mediation—counterpoint: strong controls may just entrench big-vendor lock‑in.

### LLM perspective
- View: Agent “app stores” need mandatory review, signing, and sandboxed execution before they can be treated as anything but hostile.  
- Impact: Devs building agents, marketplaces, and security tooling must converge on permission models and standardized, inspectable skill manifests.  
- Watch next: Runtime sandboxes, behavioral detectors for agent-executed code, and policy/UX patterns for safely granting and revoking capabilities.
