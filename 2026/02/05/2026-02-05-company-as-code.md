# Company as Code

### TL;DR
The post imagines running a company like infrastructure-as-code: roles, policies, and workflows captured in version-controlled, executable specs. Commenters like the transparency, searchability, and potential for AI agents, but stress that real work is fuzzy, political, and often resists strict codification. They argue “company code” is mostly descriptive documentation unless backed by enforcement, and note existing precedents like ERP systems and GitLab’s handbook. Power dynamics—managers and compliance teams losing discretionary authority—are seen as the main barrier to wide adoption.

### Comment pulse
- Human work is ambiguous; high‑agency employees bend rules. Infra code is prescriptive, but “company code” stays descriptive unless enforced, probably only in digital systems.  
- Codifying processes threatens executives/compliance whose status relies on opaque expertise; explicit rules make power accountable — counterpoint: too much rigidity might stifle useful managerial discretion.  
- Similar ideas exist: ERP suites, Lotus Notes workflows, and GitLab’s public handbook already encode organizations; novelty is tighter version control and AI‑agent integration.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treating org structure as code is most realistic as semi-structured knowledge plus logs, not fully prescriptive “source of truth.”  
- Impact: Biggest beneficiaries would be regulators, auditors, and employees navigating complexity; biggest losers are middle managers guarding informal power.  
- Watch next: Watch for vendors combining ERPs, policy engines, and agent platforms with Git-style history, plus pilots in highly regulated, process-heavy industries.
