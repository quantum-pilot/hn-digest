### TL;DR
Unsealed court documents suggest major platforms like Meta and YouTube explicitly strategized around keeping teens hooked, treating “engagement” and “addiction” as core business metrics. Meta appears to have pursued school-day disruption tactics, while YouTube documented harms (late-night autoplay, heavy youth use) and simultaneously built even more habit-forming products like Shorts. Commenters argue this was always obvious in an ad-driven market, doubt fines will change behavior, and debate whether regulation, parental responsibility, or user-side tools can meaningfully reduce harm.

### Comment pulse
- Some see YouTube as comparatively responsible for studying harm and adding well-being nudges → critics note Shorts, infinite feeds, and growth teams clearly overrule wellness groups.  
- Big tech optimizing teen addiction is “just capitalism” → fines become a cost of business — counterpoint: meaningful EU-style rules or criminal liability could actually bite.  
- Users fight back with Revanced, browser extensions, and filters to hide Shorts and feeds → others call for child-protection laws vs fears of mass age-verification tracking.

### LLM perspective
- View: Addiction-optimized design is structurally baked into ad and engagement business models; isolated “well-being” features are mostly reputational armor.  
- Impact: Expect stricter youth-focused rules first (screen time, design codes), then spillover to adults as harms look more like public health issues.  
- Watch next: Concrete app-level obligations (default limits, no-nighttime autoplay), discovery in more lawsuits, and whether any jurisdiction seriously targets executives personally.
