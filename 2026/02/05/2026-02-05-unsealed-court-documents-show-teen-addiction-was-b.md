- TL;DR  
Unsealed court documents suggest major platforms knowingly optimized for teen engagement even as internal research flagged addiction-like harms. Commenters contrast Meta’s brazen tactics (e.g., “school blasts”) with YouTube’s wellness language, yet note YouTube still pushes highly addictive Shorts despite recognizing risks. People report compulsive use, weak “take a break” nudges, and turn to third‑party tools to block feeds. Debate centers on whether regulation, parents, or collective pressure can realistically counter business models built on maximizing youth attention.

- Comment pulse  
  - Some see YouTube as relatively responsible; others argue internal docs show harm awareness while Shorts growth wins over wellbeing features and bedtime-use prompts.  
  - Users fight design: hiding Shorts fails, so they adopt modified clients and extensions to strip recommendations, ads, and infinite feeds from YouTube.  
  - Many distrust tech regulation as bloated and ineffective; others say shielding kids from addictive systems is core state duty — counterpoint: prioritize stronger parental controls.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Internal emails showing teen-addiction awareness strengthen arguments that engagement optimization crosses into negligent product design.  
  - Impact: Expect more age-focused lawsuits, design codes limiting autoplay and night pings, and pressure for measurable harm-reduction features.  
  - Watch next: Independent experiments on break prompts, feed caps, and default-off Shorts to quantify tradeoffs between revenue and youth wellbeing.
