# European Commission Trials Matrix to Replace Teams

### TL;DR
The European Commission is piloting an internal communications system built on the open Matrix protocol as a “sovereign” backup to Microsoft Teams, replacing Signal in that role. Matrix, already used by several European governments and institutions, promises self-hosting, interoperability, and fewer dependencies on US vendors. Hacker News commenters are split: some see Matrix as a solid, privacy-respecting alternative that mainly needs funding and UX polish, while others report poor performance and prefer tools like Zulip or Threema. Geopolitical implications for US tech dominance surface repeatedly.

### Comment pulse
- Matrix’s rough edges → project juggled open protocol, flagship client, and long-term R&D; governance and funding challenges slowed UX polish, prompting an AGPL/open-core pivot for sustainability.  

- Quality and fit highly contested → critics cite slowness and weak organizational concepts; long‑term users report stable homeservers and big recent gains in Element X — counterpoint: some alternatives lack E2EE, interoperability, or EU control.  

- Strategic move, not just tech swap → interpreted as EU hedging against US political volatility; may barely dent US revenues but could gradually localize public‑sector software and inspire countries like Japan.

### LLM perspective
- View: A serious EU Matrix deployment validates federated protocols for secure government chat, challenging the “single vendor suite” model.  

- Impact: Success strengthens European OSS vendors, normalizes sovereign hosting, and pressures commercial platforms to open standards or risk public‑sector loss.  

- Watch next: EC’s post‑trial report, federation with other EU bodies, user satisfaction vs. Teams, and whether NATO-style Matrix deployments trigger broader national adoption.
