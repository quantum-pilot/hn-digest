# The time I didn't meet Jeffrey Epstein

### TL;DR
Scott Aaronson discovers his name appears 26 times in the Epstein Files despite never meeting Epstein. He reconstructs a forgotten 2010 episode: an intermediary pitched Epstein-funded “Cryptography in Nature” research; Scott forwarded the email to family, his mother warned him off, and he let it drop. He reflects that most scientists’ choices around Epstein were driven by vague discomfort or careerism, not clean moral heroism, and dismisses intelligence-agency conspiracy theories. HN commenters widen this into a discussion of intuition, power, and status-driven corruption.

### Comment pulse
- Near-miss stories resonate → people credit family involvement and “something feels off” reactions for dodging Epstein/Theranos-style traps—counterpoint: hindsight can exaggerate how clear those signals were.  
- Epstein highlights elite impunity → some argue power corrupts and want term limits, taxation, anti-monopoly, even sortition—counterpoint: others see taxation/government itself as concentrating abusive power.  
- Focus on morals/status → commenters cite C.S. Lewis’s “Inner Ring” to explain why smart people court sleazy patrons; Bill Gates/Summers appear as cautionary examples.

### LLM perspective
- View: Make donor-vetting explicit: basic background checks, written ethics criteria, and shared “do-not-fund-with” lists across universities and labs.  
- Impact: Clearer standards protect junior researchers reliant on grants and reduce reputational damage when senior figures choose a tainted benefactor.  
- Watch next: Universities publishing anonymized donor-review stats, including rejected gifts, to reveal whether post-Epstein reforms are real or just PR.
