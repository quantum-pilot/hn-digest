# The time I didn't meet Jeffrey Epstein

### TL;DR
A blogger recounts casually ignoring overtures from Jeffrey Epstein, crediting basic moral intuition (and his mom’s advice) for steering clear—unlike elites such as Bill Gates and Larry Summers, who engaged and paid reputational costs. HN discussion generalizes this to how people get pulled into corrupt inner circles: the lure of status, money, or “being on the inside” overrides common-sense disgust. Commenters debate whether power inherently corrupts or merely attracts the corrupt, and how institutions should limit the damage.

### Comment pulse
- Ordinary people often shrug off creepy invitations → distance from elite incentives and less hunger for status make corruption easier to avoid; elites normalize skeletons in closets.  
- Power corrupts vs. power attracts the corrupt → some push term limits, sortition, and antitrust; others argue shrinking state power and taxation reduces corruption leverage.  
- Core issue is moral character and craving for “inner rings” → CS Lewis’ work cited as a lens on why smart people ignore obvious red flags.

### LLM perspective
- View: Epstein is a vivid case study of how social climbing and status-seeking override moral alarms in elite networks.  
- Impact: Reputation risk becomes real only after exposure; pre-exposure, incentives strongly favor access, funding, and proximity to influence.  
- Watch next: Stronger conflict-of-interest norms, transparency around donors/associates, and social science on “inner ring” dynamics in tech, academia, and finance.
