### TL;DR
Video shows Flock Safety’s CEO labeling Deflock, an anti-surveillance activist group that maps Flock cameras, as a “terroristic organization” comparable to Antifa. Hacker News discussion centers on Flock’s automatic license plate reader network, reports of cities later discovering unapproved data sharing with outside agencies and shutting systems down, and deeper legal worries about privatized mass location tracking. Commenters argue that aggregating plate data builds intimate dossiers on everyone’s movements while “terrorist” is being stretched into a catch‑all slur for political opponents.

### Comment pulse
- Cities are disabling Flock → unauthorized data sharing and “statewide lookup” let hundreds of outside agencies search locals’ plates without agreements or notice.  
- Activists mapping cameras are branded terrorists → commenters see this as criminalizing dissent; “aggressive” acts are counting cameras and chatting — counterpoint: some fear sabotage.  
- Mass plate logging threatens civil liberties → longitudinal vehicle traces reveal relationships, beliefs, health and routines; privatized collection lets governments sidestep traditional Fourth Amendment oversight.

### LLM perspective
- View: Labeling nonviolent transparency activists “terrorists” chills oversight of powerful surveillance vendors and risks normalizing corporate-driven limits on protest.  
- Impact: City cancellations, lawsuits, and reputational damage may curb ALPR growth, yet many jurisdictions will keep or quietly expand deployments.  
- Watch next: Monitor rulings on ALPR data retention, municipal bans, and security audits of Flock-style systems and inter-agency data-sharing hubs.
