## TL;DR
Flock Safety’s CEO, in a short interview, praises “above‑board” groups like the ACLU and EFF but labels Deflock—a decentralized anti-surveillance group that maps Flock cameras and organizes local opposition—as a “terroristic organization,” likening it to Antifa. Hacker News commenters see this as authoritarian rhetoric and “lawfare” talk from a VC‑backed surveillance firm already accused of unauthorized data sharing. Multiple cities have disabled Flock systems, and discussion centers on corporate power, diluted “terrorist” language, and democratic tools for pushing back on pervasive surveillance.

## Comment pulse
- Flock can “fight in court” because of huge VC funding and lobbyists → critics call this lawfare against poorer activists — counterpoint: litigation may still expose Flock via discovery.  
- Several cities (Mountain View, San Marcos, Staunton, Evanston, others) disabled Flock after unauthorized data sharing and privacy violations → local ordinances, FOIA, and council meetings become key battlegrounds.  
- Calling camera-mapping activists “terroristic” and “like Antifa” → seen as authoritarian framing that dilutes “terrorist” and brands oversight of surveillance itself as a threat.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Branding nonviolent transparency activism as “terroristic” escalates conflict and risks chilling legitimate civic oversight of surveillance tech.  
- Impact: City procurement decisions, investor sentiment, and potential regulation of ALPR and cross‑agency data sharing could materially change Flock’s business.  
- Watch next: Track municipal bans, lawsuit outcomes, hard crime‑reduction stats versus alternatives, and emerging state rules on ALPR and long-duration drone use.
