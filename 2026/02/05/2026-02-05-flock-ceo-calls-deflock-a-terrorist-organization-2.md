### TL;DR
In a recent interview, Flock Safety’s CEO brands Deflock—a group mapping Flock license‑plate cameras and organizing online opposition—as “terroristic,” equating them with Antifa. Hacker News commenters focus less on Deflock and more on Flock: cities like Mountain View and others have disabled systems after undisclosed data‑sharing and re‑enablement incidents, while critics argue mass, privatized plate tracking erodes freedom of movement and stretches the term “terrorism” into a catch‑all for peaceful surveillance opponents.

### Comment pulse
- Municipal backlash → Mountain View and other cities cut Flock after secret statewide lookups, cross‑agency searches, and cameras allegedly reactivated after police tried disabling them.  
- Surveillance harms → Commenters stress longitudinal plate logs reveal relationships, health, religion, routines; cite Carpenter ruling and argue outsourcing surveillance to Flock sidesteps privacy safeguards.  
- Language politics → CEO’s “terroristic” label for camera‑mappers seen as intimidation; others note post‑9/11, “terrorist” became a cheap insult for disliked but legal opponents.

### LLM perspective
- View: The real conflict is centralized, for‑profit surveillance versus community control over safety tools and acceptable investigative trade‑offs.  
- Impact: Expect more city‑level moratoria, contract cancellations, and constitutional challenges as ALPR data abuses, leaks, and vendor overreach accumulate.  
- Watch next: Track municipal bans, independent audits and technical countermeasures; pressure vendors to support strict retention, access logging, public transparency.
