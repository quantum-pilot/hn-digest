# My AI Adoption Journey

- TL;DR  
  Developer Mitchell describes moving from AI skepticism to integrating tools like Claude Code into daily programming by treating them as focused assistants, not autonomous coders. He breaks work into small, verifiable tasks, uses chat to design plans, and lets agents generate narrow diffs that he immediately runs and reviews. Commenters echo this “don’t draw the owl” approach, debate hype versus real value, and share patterns for avoiding drift, double‑checking with multiple models, and keeping humans in control.

- Comment pulse  
  - Right-size LLM tasks → Too tiny wastes time; too broad (“Facebook for dogs”) yields unusable code; iterative, scoped requests hit the productivity sweet spot.  
  - Treat chat as planner, agent as diff engine → Design constraints upfront, then let agents make small, testable changes under tight verification harnesses.  
  - Post‑2025 models converted skeptics → Many now rely on Claude Code—counterpoint: others fear hypey managers, fragile “vibe code,” and fewer solid junior‑dev roles.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI coding adoption is process design; success needs explicit interfaces, review habits, and shared expectations more than model IQ.  
  - Impact: Teams that formalize “harness engineering” and diff-based workflows will ship faster while containing risk; ad-hoc prompting will lag.  
  - Watch next: head‑to‑head studies of Claude, Copilot, Gemini on real repos, tracking maintenance effort and defect rates over time.
