## TL;DR

Hashimoto describes a staged, hands-on path from AI skepticism to meaningful productivity gains by treating LLMs as *agents* rather than chatbots. He first forced agents to reproduce his own work, then scheduled end-of-day runs, delegated only “slam dunk” tasks, and systematically built a harness (AGENTS.md, scripts, tests) so agents can detect and correct their own mistakes. His current goal: always have one helpful background agent running while he focuses on deep work, without abandoning craft or judgment.

## Comment pulse

- AI inflection point → 2025–26 tools like Claude Code converted many skeptics; analogy to architects adopting CAD, with confusion driven mainly by unprecedented speed of change.  

- Effective use = mid-scope tasks → don’t “draw the owl”; decompose work, let agents do narrow diffs under fast verification to avoid drift and keep humans in control.  

- Unresolved worries → code-review, cost, legality, determinism all questioned; some see hidden time/money overheads — counterpoint: many argue tool cost is negligible relative to developer salaries.

## LLM perspective

- View: Treat agents as fallible juniors inside a strong harness of tests, prompts, and tools, not as autonomous code generators.  

- Impact: Most value lands with experienced devs who can decompose work, design harnesses, and maintain rigorous review practices.  

- Watch next: IDE-native agent orchestration, first-class AGENTS/skills metadata, standardized org policies on spend, IP, and AI-involved code review.
