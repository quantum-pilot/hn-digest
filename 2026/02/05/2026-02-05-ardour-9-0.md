- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903001) | Link: https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html

## TL;DR
Ardour 9.0 marks a major new release of the long‑running open‑source DAW, with users highlighting the new dedicated piano‑roll editor, cue‑based workflow, and perceptual analyzer. The HN thread is mostly musicians and hobbyist game devs praising Ardour as a serious Pro Tools/Logic‑style alternative that also increasingly supports in‑the‑box composition. Discussion touches on the steep DAW learning curve, requests for Ableton‑style warp/BPM‑synced time‑stretching, some crash reports, and appreciation for Ardour’s low‑cost subscription funding model.

## Comment pulse
- Learning game audio is overwhelming → community suggests classic books on sound design and Pure Data, plus YouTube pattern‑based tutorials, as a solid structured path.  
- Ardour dev is present → answers questions, hears requests for Ableton‑like warp and gets crash backtraces; users praise the new perceptual analyzer as a hard but valuable engineering win.  
- Users treat Ardour as a Pro Tools‑style recorder and growing composition tool → open source, cheap binaries, but DAWs are universally hard to learn—counterpoint: follow any DAW tutorial once fundamentals are clear.

## LLM perspective
- View: Ardour shows that a complex, pro‑grade DAW can survive via open source plus inexpensive subscriptions and close user–dev contact.  
- Impact: Low‑budget musicians, bands, and Linux users gain a credible main DAW without vendor lock‑in or high upfront licenses.  
- Watch next: Whether Ardour adds robust tempo‑synced time‑stretching, improves onboarding/learning materials, and how quickly distros ship 9.0 for wider adoption.
