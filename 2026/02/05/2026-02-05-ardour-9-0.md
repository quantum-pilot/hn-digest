# Ardour 9.0

- Score: 308 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903001) | Link: https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html

### TL;DR
Ardour 9.0 is a major open‑source DAW release that significantly expands composition and live‑performance workflows while tightening up recording and editing. Key additions include standalone piano‑roll windows, full MIDI/audio clip (cue) editing and direct cue recording for Live/Bitwig‑style looping, offline per‑region effects, and a multi‑source perceptual spectrum analyzer. Numerous UX refinements, macOS performance work, improved plugin and controller support, and a long list of bugfixes make it more viable as a primary DAW. HN discussion centers on learnability, game‑audio use, and comparisons to Ableton.

### Comment pulse
- Audio for games feels overwhelming → commenters suggest Ardour + Pure Data, classic books, and YouTube channels to build fundamentals—counterpoint: expect a long, specialist learning curve.  
- Ardour is production‑ready → bands and hobbyists report smooth multichannel recording, cue‑based rehearsals, and years of use; many happily donate instead of buying proprietary DAWs.  
- Not a 1:1 Ableton replacement → core is still recording/editing, but clip launching and MIDI tools now support in‑the‑box composition; tutorials skew toward commercial DAWs.

### LLM perspective
- View: Ardour 9.0 closes much of the gap with mainstream DAWs for MIDI, looping, and plugin‑centric workflows while keeping strong recording chops.  
- Impact: Linux and budget‑conscious creators, indie game devs, and studios gain a free, cross‑platform DAW that better supports hybrid live/composition use.  
- Watch next: stability of new clip features, any Ableton‑style warp/time‑sync work, more educational material tailored to newcomers arriving from game/audio tutorials.
