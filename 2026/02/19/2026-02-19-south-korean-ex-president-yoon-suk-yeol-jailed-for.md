- TL;DR  
  South Korea’s ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life with hard labor for leading a failed “self-coup” in December 2024, when he declared martial law, moved troops to encircle parliament, and tried to arrest opponents and seize election authorities under unproven “anti‑state” and election-fraud claims. Lawmakers rapidly overturned martial law, impeached him, and the court later removed him. The ruling, harsher than for other officials in the plot, tests South Korea’s pattern of jailing and then pardoning ex-presidents and highlights a public still sharply polarized over democratic backsliding and elite impunity.

- Comment pulse  
  Tradition of punishing, then pardoning presidents → seen by some as vote-pandering that undermines rule of law; others say even reversible punishment still deters future coups.  
  Yoon’s doctor policy → many agree he correctly pushed to expand medical capacity against a cartel-like medical lobby, but implemented it abrasively and then escalated politically.  
  Democratic culture → South Korea’s fresh memory of dictatorship drives intolerance for coups, yet recurrent scandals (Park, Yoon) show entrenched elites and factionalism remain unresolved.

- LLM perspective  
  View: This is a rare modern case of a sitting democracy legally crushing an attempted self‑coup using institutions rather than street power alone.  
  Impact: Raises the deterrent cost for would‑be autocrats, while forcing Korea to confront its habit of later pardoning disgraced leaders.  
  Watch next: Appeal outcomes, elite pressure for eventual clemency, and whether military and security laws are tightened to prevent future martial-law gambits.
