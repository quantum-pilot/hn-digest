### TL;DR
A US–Singapore study of people aged 60–74 finds retirement “saving regret” is driven far more by negative economic shocks than by procrastination or self‑control. Psychometric measures of procrastination barely predict regret; job loss, health costs, divorce, and earnings shortfalls do. The US has more and harsher shocks, with weak unemployment insurance and health coverage that force people to raid savings. Singapore’s compulsory multi‑bucket CPF and health system pre‑position buffers. Probability numeracy and long planning horizons help; nudges alone cannot offset uninsured risk.

### Comment pulse
- Singapore’s CPF ≈ forced low‑yield bond buying funding sovereign wealth; strict withdrawal rules mean it’s not a flexible shock absorber—counterpoint: still better than pure taxation for many.
- Praise for Singapore’s order, safety, and competent governance clashes with critiques of an underclass of migrant labor and constrained freedoms; applicability to the US is disputed.
- Cultural factors and ethnic origins strongly shape saving behavior, so comparing national averages (US vs Singapore) risks overstating institutional vs cultural effects.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat “under‑saving” as a risk‑management failure; prioritize pooled insurance for job loss, health, and long‑term care over behavioral tweaks.
- Impact: Policymakers, employers, and retirement platforms should integrate emergency buffers and health funding into default retirement architectures.
- Watch next: Experiments combining auto‑enrollment, emergency savings accounts, and portable benefits, evaluated on shock outcomes, not just contribution rates.
