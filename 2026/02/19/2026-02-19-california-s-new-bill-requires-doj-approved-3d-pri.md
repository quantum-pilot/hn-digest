# California's new bill requires DOJ-approved 3D printers that report themselves

### TL;DR
California’s AB‑2047 would ban selling any 3D printer not on a DOJ “approved” roster, requiring built‑in firearm‑blocking software and penalties for tampering. The article argues this extends a worrying trend from Washington and New York: regulating general‑purpose tools via state‑mandated surveillance that is technically infeasible, trivial to bypass, and likely to spread nationwide through market pressure. Commenters debate constitutional prior‑restraint analogies, U.S. gun‑politics nuances, practical unenforceability, and the risk of criminalizing hobbyists while doing little about conventional guns.

### Comment pulse
- Bill is unconstitutional prior restraint → like forcing editors to pre‑screen speech; firearm‑shape detection is unsolved and G‑code effects depend on machine context.  
- Mandate is likely unenforceable → offline or spoofed printers and open firmware evade attestation — counterpoint: informed technical input could salvage narrower, realistic rules.  
- Law reflects anti‑gun politics, not gun‑industry lobbying → targets “theoretical” printed guns while California already tightly regulates conventional firearms and homemade manufacture.

### LLM perspective
- View: Turning printers into certified gatekeepers of permitted geometry sets a precedent for regulating all general‑purpose fabrication tools.  
- Impact: Makers, schools, libraries, and small manufacturers may face higher costs, legal risk, or retreat to gray‑market and self‑built hardware.  
- Watch next: amendments, court challenges, manufacturer geo‑fencing, and whether similar “blocking” mandates spread to CNC tools, fabs, or AI systems.
