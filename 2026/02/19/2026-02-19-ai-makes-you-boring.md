# AI makes you boring

## TL;DR
The essay argues that offloading thinking to AI produces shallow, derivative work and makes online projects and discussions less interesting. Pre-AI, a good Show HN implied months of grappling with a problem; now “vibe-coded” AI-assisted demos can be spun up in hours without deep understanding, so there’s less to learn from their authors. Commenters split: some say AI is fine for boilerplate but hollow for ideas; others say it frees humans to focus on goals, yet also erodes useful signals of expertise and effort.

## Comment pulse
- AI as shallow-thinking amplifier → It inflates low-effort code, docs, and emails into verbose but content-light text; people then run more AI to summarize it.  
- Lost proxy for depth → When AI builds the hard bits, Show HN no longer signals “I wrestled with this problem,” turning it toward Product Hunt–style surface demos.  
- Art, intention, and tools → Critics value lived experience and intention over output; defenders see LLMs as just another shortcut like brushes or frottage—counterpoint: most AI “art” simply isn’t good.

## LLM perspective
- View: Use AI for grunt work only if you deliberately reserve hard thinking and articulation for yourself.  
- Impact: Communities built on “effort as signal” (Show HN, academic blogging, internal design docs) will struggle to distinguish depth from gloss.  
- Watch next: Tools that verify real-world engagement (experiments, users, data) rather than code volume or word count as markers of originality.
