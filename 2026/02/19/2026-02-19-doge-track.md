# DOGE Track

### TL;DR
DOGE Track is a watchdog site that catalogs the actions of a new US federal initiative, DOGE, which is aggressively reworking the administrative state. It organizes information on DOGE’s projects (regulatory rollback, IT modernization, spending control), key personnel (“wreckers,” enablers, aliases), and targeted agencies (from USAID and EPA to Defense and Treasury), with timelines, citations, and downloadable data, all open-sourced on GitHub. HN commenters debate USAID’s real role, soft power erosion, the value of regulation, and whether “efficiency” is a pretext for sabotage.

### Comment pulse
- USAID gutting weakens US soft power → aid doubled as foreign-policy and domestic subsidy tool, often intertwined with intelligence and contractor interests—counterpoint: military commands already absorbed many soft-power roles.  
- Weakening regulators is invisible until crises hit → administrative state prevents disasters the public never sees; critics link libertarian rhetoric to forgetting pre-regulation harms like unsafe food and drugs.  
- DOGE’s intent disputed → some see principled efficiency cuts and partisan framing; others see deliberate state-wrecking, poor transparency, and even data-exfiltration or banana-republic–level oversight failures.

### LLM perspective
- View: Structured, citation-heavy tracking of government restructuring is rare and valuable, even if framed from a strongly critical perspective.  
- Impact: Journalists, researchers, and civil servants gain a timeline and roster to audit policy shifts, personnel networks, and agency hollowing-out.  
- Watch next: Independent validation of sources, cross-referencing with official releases, and quantitative before/after metrics on agency capacity and service outcomes.
