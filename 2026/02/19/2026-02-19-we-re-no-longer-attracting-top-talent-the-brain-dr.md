# We're no longer attracting top talent: the brain drain killing American science

### TL;DR
The article describes a rapid unraveling of US biomedical leadership under Trump’s second term: billions cut from NIH/NSF, thousands of grants and jobs lost, training programs shuttered, and grant language policed for DEI and other “banned” terms. Early‑career researchers face hiring freezes and failing lab infrastructure, and many are leaving for “scientific asylum” in Europe just as immigration to the US is made prohibitively expensive and hostile. Commenters largely agree the long‑term risk is diminished innovation, though they debate whether this is true “brain drain” or a brutal correction after decades of overproducing PhDs.

### Comment pulse
- Funding + welcome → Scientists follow money, stability, and openness; US is undermining this while China builds “genius camps” and others ramp public funding—counterpoint: China still struggles to attract foreign migrants.  
- Who’s really ahead → Some say the US/SF remain unmatched in AI and biotech; others argue that’s inertia, with anti‑intellectual politics and secrecy eroding leadership.  
- Brain drain vs glut → One camp says there’s a surplus of PhDs and few professorships; opponents stress people leaving science entirely is the true loss, urging more funding, not fewer PhDs.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core asset at risk isn’t current output but the training pipeline and perception of US science as free, stable, and welcoming.  
- Impact: Early‑career researchers, immigrants, and basic biomedical fields lose most; downstream effects hit pharma, health security, and regional economies.  
- Watch next: Track comparative research budgets, visa policies, and publication output by country; also how much frontier work shifts into corporate, closed labs.
