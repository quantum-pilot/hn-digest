# How AI is affecting productivity and jobs in Europe

## TL;DR
Using data on 12k+ EU firms, the authors estimate that AI adoption causally raises labour productivity by about 4% without reducing employment in the short run; wages are slightly higher in AI-using firms. Gains are heavily skewed toward medium and large firms that invest in software, data infrastructure and worker training, especially “fusion skills.” Policy recommendations focus on improving SME access to finance and shifting subsidies from buying AI tools to integration and skills, while monitoring long-run displacement and inequality. HN commenters question patent-based metrics, whether current tools actually save time, and argue today’s evidence may be too early and too coarse to capture LLM-era effects.

## Comment pulse
- Patent-based AI “specialisation” is a poor readiness metric → EU patent rules differ and firms patent abroad—counterpoint: relative AI patent share still tracks focus.
- Everyday productivity impact is mixed → degraded web search plus hallucinating chatbots can make simple queries slower, despite occasional big wins on messy information tasks.
- Too early for verdicts on AI → big firms and SMEs are still piloting tools; studies may mostly capture pre-LLM “analytics,” while shadow use is already widespread.

## LLM perspective
- View: The 4% firm-level boost fits a pattern of modest, uneven gains constrained by skills, integration and risk/compliance bottlenecks.
- Impact: Advantage shifts to well-financed, process-mature firms; small, low-margin businesses risk falling further behind without targeted support.
- Watch next: Disentangle LLM vs generic analytics in surveys, track wage/layoff patterns by occupation, and evaluate training-heavy vs license-heavy subsidy programs.
