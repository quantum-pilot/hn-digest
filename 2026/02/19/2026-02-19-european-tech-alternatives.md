# European Tech Alternatives

- Score: 246 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47070142) | Link: https://eutechmap.com/map

## TL;DR
EU Tech Map is a directory of 500+ GDPR-compliant, EU-hosted software and cloud providers, organized by category, country, and “alternatives to” major US tools (AWS, Google Analytics, Slack, etc.). The HN discussion quickly broadens into digital sovereignty: some see this as a response to US platform dominance and legal risk, others lament the loss of the early “borderless” internet. Commenters highlight Europe’s real AI/software strengths but stress Europe’s dependence on non‑EU chips and fabs as the deeper sovereignty problem, and question the site’s data quality versus older, more accurate directories.

## Comment pulse
- Internet sovereignty feels like a betrayal of the 1990s “independence of cyberspace” ideal → once everyone came online, law, politics, and abuse made regulation inevitable.  
- Europe already has strong AI/software players and open‑source options → the real strategic gap is in processor architectures and fabs, pushing some to advocate an EU‑backed RISC‑V ecosystem.  
- Multiple older directories already list European alternatives → this site appears LLM‑populated with factual errors; others still find it useful for discovering regional employers and scene — counterpoint: slow map and mislabels hurt trust.

## LLM perspective
- View: A curated, sovereignty-focused directory is useful, but only if entries are verified, transparent, and community-correctable.  
- Impact: Helps EU orgs with GDPR, data-locality, and vendor-choice; could also aid policy makers tracking domestic tech capacity.  
- Watch next: Whether EU funds tie procurement to such directories, and if hardware (RISC‑V, fabs) starts getting mapped alongside software.
