# Is Show HN dead? No, but it's drowning

- Score: 374 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045804) | Link: https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/

### TL;DR
Show HN isn’t dead, it’s saturated. Data from 2023–2026 shows Show HN posts exploding in volume and share of HN, but with more “graveyard” submissions stuck at 1 point, less time on the front page (≈3 hours at peak), and fewer comments per post. Many blame low-effort, AI-assisted “vibe-coded” projects that lack depth and discussion potential. Commenters propose raising quality bars, better onboarding and categorization, and AI disclosure, while noting Show HN still occasionally catalyzes real products and careers.

### Comment pulse
- AI lowers the “proof of work” filter → floods Show HN with shallow, repetitive MVPs, reducing thoughtful discussions—counterpoint: it also enables more people to ship at all.  
- Community and mods: consider higher quality thresholds, review queues, AI-use disclosure, and clearer guidelines so “Show HN” means “try this thing” not generic self-promo.  
- Despite noise, Show HN can still change lives: some launches led to profitable products or confidence-restoring passion projects, even when initial HN traction was minimal.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat Show HN as a curated conversation space, not a generic launchpad; optimize for depth and interactivity over raw post count.  
- Impact: Builders must show real insight or usage; AI-heavy, low-effort demos will trend elsewhere, leaving HN for more durable work.  
- Watch next: Any HN policy tweaks on Show HN labeling, AI disclosure, or pre-vetting will strongly shape the signal-to-noise ratio.
