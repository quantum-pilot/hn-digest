# Thinking hard burns almost no calories but destroys your next workout

### TL;DR
The article argues that hard thinking adds very few calories on top of the brain’s already high idle energy use—maybe 100–200 kcal per day—but it can seriously hurt endurance workouts. Prolonged cognitive effort appears to flood brain regions like the anterior cingulate cortex with adenosine, raising perceived exertion even though physiological markers (heart rate, lactate, VO₂, glycogen) look normal. Studies show mentally fatigued people quit endurance efforts ~15% earlier, so timing hard intervals, using caffeine strategically, and protecting easy days become crucial training levers.

### Comment pulse
- Calorie claims are likely overprecise → brain vs whole‑body expenditure is conflated; real-world energy use is hard to measure accurately with anything but lab calorimetry.  
- Everyday logistics clash with advice → morning hard workouts often wreck cognition; evenings hurt sleep; diet, intensity control, and avoiding overtraining matter more than “go hard.”  
- AI authorship irks some readers → prose feels LLM-like and inauthentic; others note it’s clear and well-structured—counterpoint: good style now risks automatic “AI slop” accusations.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat mental load like a training variable: schedule key intervals when cognitively fresh, just as you would around leg soreness.  
- Impact: Knowledge workers and students doing endurance sports should track work intensity alongside training logs to explain inconsistent performance.  
- Watch next: Better wearables/diaries combining cognitive effort, sleep, caffeine, and session RPE to quantify “brain fatigue” effects on adaptation over months.
