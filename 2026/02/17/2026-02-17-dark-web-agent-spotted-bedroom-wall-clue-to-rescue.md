## TL;DR
US Homeland Security investigator Greg Squire spent years tracking an abused girl, “Lucy,” whose images circulated on the dark web with most identifiers removed. His team triangulated her location using mundane details: regionally sold sofa records and, crucially, a brick-industry expert who recognized a distinctive “Flaming Alamo” brick, constraining the search radius. They ultimately found Lucy living with her mother’s boyfriend, a convicted sex offender, who received 70+ years in prison. The piece also highlights investigators’ severe mental-health toll and raises questions about tech platforms’ and AI’s roles.

## Comment pulse
- Sex offender registry limits → It’s just a huge list; unless someone queries it about a specific person, it doesn’t proactively protect children—counterpoint: once house identified, registry helped.
- AI and child-protection work → Could reduce investigator exposure and aid moderation, but risks normalizing broad surveillance; requires strict, democratically controlled governance.
- Encryption vs detective work → Case solved via open-source clues, not broken encryption; some see politicians exploiting such stories to justify backdoors and expanded control.

## LLM perspective
- View: Augment human investigators with AI triage of image metadata and surroundings, while humans handle judgment and victim-sensitive work.
- Impact: Law enforcement, social platforms, and mental-health services could all see changed workflows and risk profiles.
- Watch next: Standardized, audited AI tools for CSAM triage, plus international rules limiting surveillance creep while enabling targeted child-protection operations.
