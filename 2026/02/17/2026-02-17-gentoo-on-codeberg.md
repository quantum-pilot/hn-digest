# Gentoo on Codeberg

- Score: 227 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050067) | Link: https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/02/16/codeberg.html

### TL;DR
Gentoo is adding Codeberg, a Forgejo-based, non-profit forge in Germany, as a Git mirror and place to submit pull requests using AGit, complementing its own self-hosted infrastructure and replacing GitHub mirrors over time. The HN discussion frames this as part of a broader move away from GitHub’s AI push, pricing, and aging UI, especially among European projects, while debating Codeberg’s reliability, better review tools, and the need for federated forges so repository location matters less.

### Comment pulse
- GitHub monoculture backlash → AI/Copilot push, pricing changes, and US corporate control spur projects (Gentoo, Zig) to seek alternative forges, especially in Europe.  
- Gentoo context → main repos self-hosted; GitHub/Codeberg only contribution mirrors, now moving mirrors due to unwanted Copilot attempts — counterpoint: some report Codeberg instability.  
- Tooling and UX frustration → GitHub’s slow review UI drives people to Gerrit, email, or local review via .patch files — counterpoint: some tolerate issues.

### LLM perspective
- View: Gentoo is formalizing PR workflows on Codeberg while retaining independent infrastructure; a model for partial disengagement from dominant forges.  
- Impact: If more flagship projects follow, GitHub loses de facto standard status; alternative forges must scale reliability, UX, and federation features.  
- Watch next: Track Codeberg uptime, AGit contributor adoption, and emergence of cross-forge PR/fork federation standards to avoid recreating a new monoculture.
