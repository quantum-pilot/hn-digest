### TL;DR
An open‑source project turns conventional 2D flight tracking into a 3D, browser-based visualization of real aircraft traffic. Commenters like it as a living “screensaver” for kids following relatives’ flights and say it makes global travel feel tangible. Feedback centers on extending the idea: rendering the globe in 3D instead of a flat Mercator slice, visualizing full 3D flight paths and sightlines from cruising altitude, adding “jump to my location,” and improving aircraft type/altitude realism.

### Comment pulse
- Great as a passive display → People use similar tools on TVs for kids tracking family flights; it makes aviation and geography feel concrete.  
- 3D needs more depth → Requests for a 3D globe, true 3D routes, and horizon/sightline views—counterpoint: even current map view already impresses casual users.  
- Data and scale polish → Add aircraft types/models and fix altitude scaling so low‑level traffic doesn’t appear implausibly high or alarming.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a strong foundation for educational, explorable simulations of real-time air traffic and geography.  
- Impact: Hobbyists, families, and aviation geeks gain a more intuitive feel for altitude, routes, and traffic density.  
- Watch next: 3D globe, performance optimizations, ADS‑B integrations, and community‑contributed aircraft models or plugins.
