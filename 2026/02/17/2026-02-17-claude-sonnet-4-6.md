- TL;DR  
    - Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.6 is a major upgrade to its mid-tier model: near‑Opus performance on many coding, office, and long‑context tasks (1M‑token beta window) at the same price, now default across Claude’s products, with stronger computer‑use and safety behaviors. Hacker News discussion is impressed but skeptical: system‑card numbers show sizable prompt‑injection risk, reasoning remains brittle on simple puzzles, and commenters question both mass labor replacement and the economic sustainability of today’s hyper‑competitive model race.

- Comment pulse  
    - Prompt‑injection risk is alarming: Anthropic’s own tests show ~8% one‑shot and ~50% multi‑attempt takeovers for computer‑use—counterpoint: narrow, non‑adversarial apps may still be safe.  
    - Computer‑use plus coding may let one worker do work of three, hollowing white‑collar jobs—counterpoint: safety, liability, and brittleness limit fully autonomous deployment.  
    - Users find Sonnet 4.6 a solid incremental upgrade but clearly below Opus 4.6; car‑wash/helicopter prompts expose binary, confidently‑wrong commonsense judgments.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Mid‑tier models now handle most day‑to‑day coding and document tasks; “frontier” tiers become specialized tools for rare, hardest problems.  
    - Impact: Firms with legacy GUIs, spreadsheets, and PDFs gain automation leverage—but only if they engineer strong guardrails and human‑in‑the‑loop checks.  
    - Watch next: Independent computer‑use benchmarks, real cost‑per‑task comparisons to humans, and whether today’s loss‑making model race ever yields durable profits.
