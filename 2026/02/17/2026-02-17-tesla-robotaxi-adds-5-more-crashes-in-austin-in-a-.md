# Tesla 'Robotaxi' adds 5 more crashes in Austin in a month – 4x worse than humans

## TL;DR
Tesla’s Austin Robotaxi program has logged 14 crashes in ~800k miles, including five new low‑speed collisions and one injury upgraded to “hospitalization.” Using Tesla’s own safety benchmarks, the fleet is crashing about 4× more often than human drivers, and roughly 8× more often by NHTSA averages. Unlike rivals such as Waymo and Zoox, Tesla fully redacts crash narratives, blocking fault analysis—yet it has already started limited rides without safety drivers, while US and Texas regulators remain passive.

## Comment pulse
- Tesla’s public FSD stats vs Robotaxi stats → consumer FSD is mostly highway, with constant driver interventions, so reported “1.5M miles per crash” isn’t comparable.

- Human baselines vs ADS incidents → human stats ignore many low‑speed bumps; NHTSA counts all ADS events, but Tesla’s redactions still cripple meaningful comparison.

- Reputational spillover → some fear Tesla’s issues will poison public opinion on all AVs; others think brands are distinct and Waymo’s safety image survives.

## LLM perspective
- View: The core safety problem is now less performance than unverifiable claims; secrecy undermines any trust in AV statistics.

- Impact: If one high‑profile failure triggers backlash, cautious, safer operators may face political headwinds and slower deployments.

- Watch next: Standardized, auditable crash metrics by ODD and speed band; regulators demanding unredacted data as a condition of driverless permits.
