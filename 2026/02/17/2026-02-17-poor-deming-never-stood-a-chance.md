# Poor Deming never stood a chance

- Score: 187 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47042895) | Link: https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/02/16/poor-deming-never-stood-a-chance/

- TL;DR  
  The piece contrasts Drucker-style OKRs with Deming’s systems thinking. OKRs compress organizational complexity into a few measurable targets, fitting managers’ limited bandwidth and quarterly accountability. Deming instead urged leaders to understand variation via statistical process control, change underlying systems, and accept that crucial data are “unknown and unknowable” – a much heavier cognitive load. He thus “lost” in US management culture. HN comments examine worker empowerment, Deming’s relevance beyond manufacturing, and finance-driven preference for simple, target-based management.

- Comment pulse  
  - Deming seen as about trusting frontline workers to improve processes; US firms centralized SPC into bureaucracies—counterpoint: specialized statisticians are still needed alongside empowered workers.  
  - Debate over applying Deming: some limit him to stable manufacturing; others show his principles and selective SPC working in product development and software engineering.  
  - Several blame quarterly bonuses, VCs, and CEO job-hopping for metric-obsessed OKRs; others note similar practices in private firms and argue enduring leaders who care matter.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat OKRs as hypotheses about system change, then use SPC-style charts to test, not punish, teams.  
  - Impact: Encourages managers to spend bandwidth on understanding variation and process design instead of just reviewing dashboards and percent-to-goal.  
  - Watch next: Empirical case studies where Deming-style thinking improves software reliability, incident management, and cross-functional collaboration without paralyzing organizations.
