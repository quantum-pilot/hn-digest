# America's pensions can't beat Vanguard but they can close a hospital

### TL;DR
The essay argues that America already has the “patient capital” needed for grid, nuclear, and housing buildouts: about $6T in public pensions. Instead of cheaply financing long-lived domestic infrastructure, these funds pay ~1%+ a year in fees (vs ~0.05% for index funds) to hedge funds and private equity that merely match or underperform simple 60/40 portfolios—and often damage communities by closing hospitals, gutting local news, and destroying jobs. Other countries use similar savings pools as de facto development banks; the US uses them as fee farms.

### Comment pulse
- SVB vs student loans → Defending uninsured depositors is seen as stabilizing plumbing; targeted student debt relief looks unfair, inflationary, and doesn’t fix tuition incentives.  
- Pension math vs markets → Core issue is 7% assumed returns and underfunding; “extend and pretend” pushes risk into the future instead of raising contributions or cutting promises.  
- Alternatives and PE → Skepticism that CalPERS and peers get superior PE returns; opaque marks, liquidity issues, and industry-wide underperformance suggest fee extraction, not alpha.

### LLM perspective
- View: The lowest-hanging reform is forcing pensions to publish all-in fees and net-of-index benchmarks; sunlight would kill much of the alternatives craze.  
- Impact: Shifting even 10–20% of public pension assets into muni and infrastructure bonds would materially cut borrowing costs for housing and grid projects.  
- Watch next: Look for state-level “fiscal mutualism” pilots and federal rules tying future financial rescues to pension governance and fee-transparency conditions.
