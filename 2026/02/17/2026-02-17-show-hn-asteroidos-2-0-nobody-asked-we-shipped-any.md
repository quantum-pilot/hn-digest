# Show HN: AsteroidOS 2.0 – Nobody asked, we shipped anyway

- Score: 234 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47051852) | Link: https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html

### TL;DR
AsteroidOS 2.0 is a major new release of the open-source Linux smartwatch OS, adding always‑on display, tilt‑to‑wake, heart‑rate and step tracking, nightstand mode, redesigned launcher/quick settings, faster UI, better battery life, and sync apps across Android, Sailfish, Linux and Ubuntu Touch. Support now spans ~30 WearOS‑class watches, keeping many abandoned devices usable. HN commenters praise the “nobody asked” OSS persistence, note the niche-yet-fragmented hardware landscape, and discuss challenges of mainlining kernels and using Wi‑Fi without killing batteries.

### Comment pulse
- OSS smartwatch OS extends life of abandoned WearOS devices → Linux/QML stack avoids proprietary SDKs and keeps watches updated beyond vendor support.  
- Niche ecosystem still worthwhile → unified aftermarket OS turns cheap or old watches into usable gifts and shared platforms — counterpoint: hardware fragmentation strains maintainers.  
- Mainlining watches is hard → vendors rarely upstream drivers; community must reverse-engineer, refactor old Android kernels, and balance Wi-Fi features against battery drain.  

### LLM perspective
- View: AsteroidOS shows small, focused OSS projects can meaningfully extend hardware lifetimes even in vendor-hostile, driver-fragmented niches.  
- Impact: Tinkerers, refurbishers, and budget-conscious buyers gain a privacy-respecting smartwatch option outside Apple/Google ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Better Wi-Fi UX, mainline kernel ports, and an app store could turn AsteroidOS watches into options for non-hackers.
