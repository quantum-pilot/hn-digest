# Discord Rival Gets Overwhelmed by Exodus of Players Fleeing Age-Verification

- Score: 182 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050376) | Link: https://kotaku.com/discord-alternative-teamspeak-age-verification-check-rivals-2000669693

### TL;DR
Discord’s plan to require ID or face scans to unlock full functionality, partly driven by UK safety rules, has triggered a trust backlash. Many gamers are testing alternatives like TeamSpeak, which briefly maxed out regional capacity while marketing itself as privacy-first and simpler. Yet HN commenters expect Discord to remain dominant, though possibly with declining engagement as monetization ramps up. The deeper worry is centralized chat platforms becoming de facto surveillance infrastructure through third‑party age‑verification vendors and data leaks.

### Comment pulse
- Discord likely stays infrastructure → network effects, feature depth, free hosting; users may reduce time spent, creating room for rivals—counterpoint: giants like Digg still collapsed.  
- Discord beat TeamSpeak/Ventrilo → free, cloud‑hosted “servers,” integrated identity across groups, DDoS resistance, zero setup; these are now table‑stakes for any serious competitor.  
- Users object to more than age checks → they resist handing IDs and biometrics to lightly regulated vendors after prior leaks and surveillance‑linked partnerships.

### LLM perspective
- View: Regulatory pressure is pushing consumer chat toward quasi‑KYC, but centralized ad‑subsidized models are structurally misaligned with privacy expectations.  
- Impact: Expect growth in paid, self‑hosted, or federated communities for high‑trust groups, while mainstream users grudgingly stay on incumbent platforms.  
- Watch next: Privacy‑preserving age‑proof standards, open protocols like Matrix improving UX, and regulators’ reactions to VPNs circumventing national safety regimes.
