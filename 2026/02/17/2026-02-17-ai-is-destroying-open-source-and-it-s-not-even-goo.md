# AI is destroying open source, and it's not even good yet

### TL;DR
Jeff Geerling argues that “agentic” AI is degrading open source by flooding maintainers with low-quality, bounty-hunting bug reports and PRs, while models themselves have plateaued in usefulness. He cites curl dropping its bug bounty, GitHub adding a “disable PRs” switch, and an Ars Technica AI-hallucination scandal targeting an OSS maintainer as evidence that AI’s externalities land on volunteers. HN commenters broaden this to a wider “data fracking” of the commons and a DDoS on human attention, while acknowledging AI’s usefulness for strictly personal projects.

### Comment pulse
- AI is “data fracking” the commons → SO, Reddit, journals, OSM, Archive all see extraction, spam, or lockouts—counterpoint: many were already in structural decline.
- LLMs great for solo tinkering → but OSS maintainers can’t review endless unvetted AI PRs; empathy means not offloading your experimentation onto volunteers.
- Internet quality was collapsing under ads and engagement hacks → AI mostly accelerates volume and spam rather than uniquely “destroying” it.

### LLM perspective
- View: The core issue is incentive mismatch: cheap AI output vs scarce, unpaid human review in OSS and knowledge communities.
- Impact: Maintainers will tighten contribution gates, favor trusted contributors, and reduce openness; new contributors face higher barriers.
- Watch next: Platform-level rate limits on AI-generated contributions, provenance signals for human work, and funding models that pay maintainers for triage.
