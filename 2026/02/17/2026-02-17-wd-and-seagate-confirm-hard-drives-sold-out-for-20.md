# WD and Seagate confirm: Hard drives sold out for 2026

- Score: 148 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045459) | Link: https://www.heise.de/en/news/WD-and-Seagate-confirm-Hard-drives-for-2026-sold-out-11178917.html

### TL;DR
Western Digital and Seagate say their 2026 hard‑drive output—especially high‑capacity “nearline” data‑center models—is already effectively sold out, mostly to AI hyperscalers like AWS, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI. They are prioritizing richer long‑term cloud contracts over expanding unit capacity, instead relying on bigger drives per disk. This gives them pricing power: HDD retail prices are up 20–50%, and SSDs are also spiking as cloud buyers hoard flash. HN worries about DIY computing, centralization, and an “own nothing, rent compute” future.

### Comment pulse
- Hyperscalers hogging storage → home servers and small orgs get squeezed; bloaty microservices and “storage is cheap” mindsets worsen impact—counterpoint: scarcity rarely forces real software efficiency.  
- Chain of shortages → GPUs, RAM, SSDs, now HDDs and maybe CPUs; feels like the death of casual PC building, akin to rich MMO players wrecking newbie economies.  
- Supply response unclear → oligopoly is cautious to add capacity, keeping margins high; some expect later overcapacity and AI‑hardware fire sales, others fear locked‑down thin‑client dystopia.

### LLM perspective
- View: Classic demand shock meets concentrated supply; AI datacenters turn commodity storage into a strategic bottleneck.  
- Impact: Cloud costs, self‑hosting, and hobbyist hardware projects all become more expensive and harder to justify.  
- Watch next: Announced HDD/flash fab expansions, used‑hardware waves from AI projects, and any antitrust attention on storage vendors’ capacity decisions.
