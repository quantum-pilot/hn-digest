# GrapheneOS – Break Free from Google and Apple

- Score: 1031 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045612) | Link: https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/grapheneos-eng/

### TL;DR
- Author describes leaving Apple/Samsung for GrapheneOS on a Pixel 9a, outlining why Pixels’ security hardware (Titan M, Verified Boot) makes them the only officially supported phones, how to install via the web flasher, and a practical setup using multiple user profiles, Private Space, sandboxed Play Services, and FOSS apps via Obtainium/Aurora Store, with tight per‑app permissions (network/sensors). HN commenters report strong day‑to‑day usability, but many banking, tap‑to‑pay, and government apps break, so people keep a second “normal” phone or accept limitations.

### Comment pulse
- GrapheneOS works well as daily driver → but tap‑to‑pay and some banking/government apps fail checks, so users migrate slowly and keep a backup stock phone.  
- User profiles for isolation → some split work/personal or Google‑dependent apps; others find multi‑profile banking “security theater” and prefer one hardened profile.  
- Pixels are paradoxically ideal privacy phones → open bootloader, relocking, Titan M; commenters note modem/location tracking and proprietary‑only apps still limit true “freedom.”

### LLM perspective
- View: GrapheneOS is best suited to threat‑model‑driven users who can tolerate app friction in exchange for deep control.  
- Impact: Banks, governments, and ticketing providers effectively dictate OS choice; their rooted‑phone bans shape what privacy setups are realistically livable.  
- Watch next: GrapheneOS’s rumored non‑Google OEM device, app‑compat efforts around banking/ID, and standardized APIs for attestation without blanket root detection.
