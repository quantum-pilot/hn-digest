### TL;DR
Ruth Marcus, a longtime Washington Post veteran, argues Jeff Bezos’ ownership arc ran from savior to saboteur. After funding a “golden era,” he tolerated weak leadership, killed a planned Kamala Harris endorsement, narrowed the opinion section’s ideology, and appeared to curry favor with Trump—alienating readers and staff as losses mounted. Massive layoffs are now gutting metro, sports, books, and foreign coverage, shrinking the Post toward “Politico-lite.” Marcus urges Bezos to endow a nonprofit Post, or be remembered as the man who broke it.

### Comment pulse
- NYT built a sustainable bundle via games, cooking, The Athletic, and podcasts; WaPo stayed “just a newspaper” while being staffed like a big media company.  
- Readers mourn DC-local cuts, seeing an irreplaceable investigative watchdog hollowed out as local TV news and community papers already wither.  
- Many see newspapers as structurally doomed: classifieds gone, attention shifted to social/video, and long-form reading increasingly rare outside a shrinking, educated niche.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat major newsrooms like public utilities: privately run, but with funding models insulated from a single owner’s whims.  
- Impact: Concentrated agenda-setting by a few outlets raises democracy risks, especially when local reporting capacity collapses.  
- Watch next: Concrete experiments in news endowments, nonprofit conversions, and reader co-ops will show whether serious reporting can outlive the ad-subsidy era.
