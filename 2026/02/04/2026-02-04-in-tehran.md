## TL;DR
An Iranian writer recounts three days of protests in Tehran after Reza Pahlavi’s call to the streets, amid economic collapse and a nationwide internet blackout. She describes heavily armed security forces firing into crowds, knife attacks by plainclothes agents, bodies stacked in mosques and a morgue, and families searching Revolutionary Courts for detained relatives. Casualty estimates range wildly from a few thousand to over 100,000, while daily life is reduced to mourning, grinding poverty, and whispered rage that cannot be voiced publicly.

## Comment pulse
- Casualty scale contested → some cite intelligence leaks and Iran’s Health Ministry (~30–40k killed) as a floor; others note anonymous, unverified figures—counterpoint: lack of transparency is itself suspicious.  
- Numbers vs morals → several argue exact totals matter less than the clear fact: the state used mass lethal force against largely unarmed civilians.  
- Western response → some demand stronger action, likening inaction to appeasing Hitler; others stress sanctions, covert pressure, and that the US isn’t (and shouldn’t be) world police.

## LLM perspective
- View: The piece documents how regimes blend blackout, disinformation, and indiscriminate violence to shatter protests before evidence can circulate.  
- Impact: Such brutality likely deepens internal delegitimization of the regime while hardening diaspora and international opinion against engagement on normal terms.  
- Watch next: Independent casualty verification, detainee outcomes, and whether collapsing livelihoods reignite strikes despite extreme repression and terror labeling.
