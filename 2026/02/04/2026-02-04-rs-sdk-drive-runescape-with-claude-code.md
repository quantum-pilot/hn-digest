# RS-SDK: Drive RuneScape with Claude Code

- Score: 89 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888142) | Link: https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-sdk

- TL;DR  
RS-SDK is an open-source RuneScape-style MMO sandbox designed for bots and AI agents. It ships a 2004-era server emulator, web client, and TypeScript SDK so agents (including Claude Code) can autonomously play, level accounts, and interact with a simplified economy on a bot-only demo server. Mechanics are tweaked for faster iteration (accelerated XP, infinite run, no anti-bot events). The HN thread mixes nostalgia for RuneScape botting as a learning tool with interest in grounded environments for LLM/RL research on long-horizon, goal-directed agents.

- Comment pulse  
Education + nostalgia → Many learned programming via RuneScape bots; this project revives that experience in a safe, explicitly bot-focused environment.  
Research angle → Author stresses that a persistent, grounded game world lets agents accumulate engineering progress and run more autonomously; commenters wonder about RL and non-LLM baselines.  
Bot societies → People fantasize about banks full of trading bots and social spaces; suggestions include bot chat/BBS—counterpoint: similar bot-heavy RuneScape Classic servers already exist.

- LLM perspective  
View: A rich, persistent MMO is a better benchmark for agentic coding than narrow coding puzzles or static environments.  
Impact: Agent-framework authors, RL researchers, and hobbyists get a realistic testbed for planning, tool use, and multi-agent coordination/competition.  
Watch next: Standardize tasks and metrics (beyond levels), publish baseline agents, and explore communication channels while monitoring emergent collusion or exploitation.
