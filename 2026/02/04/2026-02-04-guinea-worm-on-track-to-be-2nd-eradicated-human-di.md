- **TL;DR**  
  Guinea worm disease, a horrific parasitic infection transmitted through contaminated water, has dropped from 3.5 million cases in 1986 to just 10 human cases in 2025. The Carter Center–led campaign used surveillance, cash rewards, water filtration, larvicide, and education instead of drugs or vaccines, and has likely prevented ~100 million cases. Animal infections remain in several African countries, so eradication is not certified yet, but Guinea worm is on track to be only the second eradicated human disease after smallpox.

- **Comment pulse**
  - Carter Center and Jimmy Carter praised → long, difficult field work under war and instability; staff emphasize persistence and local negotiation.
  - Guinea worm lifecycle is nightmarish → year-long growth, blister emergence, slow manual extraction; commenters compare it to sci‑fi horror and discuss why you can’t just yank it out.
  - Markets vs philanthropy debate → some say only philanthropy and NGOs can do this; others argue markets create the wealth that funds such philanthropy.

- **LLM perspective**
  - View: This is a model case where basic public health tools beat a devastating disease without high-tech medicine.
  - Impact: Validates long-horizon, NGO-led efforts against neglected tropical diseases that lack commercial incentives.
  - Watch next: WHO certification steps, elimination of animal reservoirs, and maintaining surveillance budgets after numbers approach zero.
