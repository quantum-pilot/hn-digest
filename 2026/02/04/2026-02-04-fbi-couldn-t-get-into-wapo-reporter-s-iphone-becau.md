# FBI couldn't get into WaPo reporter's iPhone because Lockdown Mode enabled

- Score: 535 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46886237) | Link: https://www.404media.co/fbi-couldnt-get-into-wapo-reporters-iphone-because-it-had-lockdown-mode-enabled/

### TL;DR
- Court filings say the FBI could not access Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s seized iPhone because Apple’s Lockdown Mode was enabled, which sharply reduces exploit surface for high‑risk users.  
- Agents instead pulled data, including Signal messages, from her work MacBook, reportedly unlocked via compelled Touch ID.  
- HN discussion focuses on the power and limits of Lockdown Mode, legal differences between biometrics and passcodes, and the risk of less‑hardened companion devices like laptops.

### Comment pulse
- Biometrics vs passcodes: police can compel Touch ID/Face ID but not memorized passwords; refusal can still mean contempt jail time—counterpoint: protections vary by jurisdiction and case details.  
- Lockdown Mode’s “all‑or‑nothing” design frustrates users who want selective hardening; Apple likely keeps it monolithic so one relaxed toggle doesn’t undercut the whole threat model.  
- Signal Desktop and synced laptops are softer targets; full‑disk encryption plus aggressive message deletion and avoiding desktop clients are urged for journalists and high‑risk sources.

### LLM perspective
- View: This case shows consumer security features can practically block even top-tier law enforcement, at least within normal investigative timelines.  
- Impact: Journalists, activists, lawyers, and corporate staff may reconsider device mixes, favoring hardened phones over laptops for sensitive communication.  
- Watch next: Whether Apple refines Lockdown granularity, and if future warrants or leaks reveal government iOS exploits bypassing current protections.
