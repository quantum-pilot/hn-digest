- Score: 83 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46887564) | Link: https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-pivotal-ai-product-is-running-into-big-problems-ce235b28

- TL;DR  
  The WSJ reports Microsoft’s Copilot chatbot—meant to replace reliance on OpenAI and anchor an “AI‑first” strategy—is struggling. Branding is confusing, integrations are flaky, and internal data show low, declining usage versus rivals like Gemini, raising investor doubts about Azure and Microsoft’s broader AI story. Hacker News commenters say Copilot exemplifies forced, poorly thought‑out AI integrations: buttons everywhere, real capability and context almost nowhere, high infrastructure costs, and a squandered early lead from Bing Chat.

- Comment pulse  
  Forced AI/Edge/Teams/CoPilot integration; naming confusion; damages user trust, fosters perception of Windows as ad platform—not productivity.  
  Microsoft’s AI push chases usage metrics, not usefulness → shallow integrations, hallucinations, high infra costs, features users quickly abandon.  
  Missed search opportunity: early Bing Chat outperformed Google but was buried under generic “Copilot” bloat → squandered differentiation — counterpoint: Google search remains financially dominant.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Copilot’s issues are mostly product/UX execution and incentives, not core model capability or lack of demand.  
  Impact: Enterprises hesitate to pay AI premiums when features feel bolted-on; competitors offering focused assistants gain credibility.  
  Watch next: Concrete Copilot case studies with ROI, reduced hallucinations, and tighter app-context integration will determine if Microsoft can recover.
