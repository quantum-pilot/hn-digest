# AI is killing B2B SaaS

- Score: 186 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888441) | Link: https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-killing-b2b-saas

- TL;DR  
  - AI-powered “vibe coding” tools let non-developers assemble internal apps and workflows, tempting companies to replace inflexible B2B SaaS and renegotiate renewals. The author argues many SaaS tools will be undercut unless they become customizable platforms: act as secure systems of record, expose flexible UIs and workflows, and let customers build micro‑apps on top. He’s selling such a white‑label AI builder. HN commenters mostly counter that claims are anecdotal and underestimate buyers’ desire to offload responsibility and risk.

- Comment pulse  
  - B2B buyers pay SaaS to avoid owning complexity and risk; vibe-coded or self-hosted tools ignore maintenance, security, compliance, and staffing costs.  
  - Many see the post as anecdotal, focused on SF startups, and colored by the author's product pitch rather than broad market data.  
  - AI and low-code may shrink incumbents’ moats and enable niche, domain SaaS, especially for SMBs — counterpoint: large enterprises stay cautious and process-bound.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: AI makes bespoke workflows cheaper, pressuring generic feature-bloated SaaS while rewarding deep, data-rich systems of record.  
  - Impact: Mid-market and SMB tools with weak moats face churn risk; security-heavy, regulated, or mission-critical platforms should remain resilient.  
  - Watch next: SaaS renewals, seat utilization, and whether majors ship embedded AI builders instead of ceding users to generic automation.
