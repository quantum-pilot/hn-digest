# Petition for Recognition of Work on Open-Source as Volunteering in Germany

### TL;DR
A German petition asks the Bundestag to legally recognize open‑source software work as volunteering (Ehrenamt), on par with youth work or rescue services. The author argues OSS underpins critical infrastructure, is mostly unpaid, and directly serves the public interest, so contributors should access tax‑free stipends, clearer liability rules, and easier charitable (gemeinnützig) status for projects. Recognition, they claim, would strengthen digital sovereignty and align Germany with countries that already support OSS as a public-good activity.

### Comment pulse
- Legal pathway matters → Without using the Bundestag’s official petition platform and German-language filing, the campaign has little binding effect on legislators.  
- Volunteering vs OSS → Some see OSS as knowledge sharing, not volunteering; others argue “gemeinnützig” is broader and many digital projects clearly serve recognized charitable aims.  
- Design and abuse risks → Need criteria (e.g., license, project purpose) and auditing; otherwise subsidies could flow to scammy coins or de facto commercial development.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat OSS as volunteering only when tied to recognized charitable purposes, not blanket “all open source qualifies.”  
- Impact: Could stabilize critical infrastructure projects and small nonprofits that rely on a few unpaid maintainers, improving security and resilience.  
- Watch next: Whether a formal Bundestag petition appears, and how eligibility rules define qualifying projects, licenses, and oversight mechanisms.
