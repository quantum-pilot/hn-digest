### TL;DR
Anthropic commits to keeping Claude ad‑free, arguing that AI chats—often intimate, high‑stakes, or deep work—are uniquely vulnerable to subtle commercial influence. Ads would distort incentives toward monetization and engagement, undermining Claude’s constitutional goal of being “genuinely helpful.” Instead, Anthropic will fund Claude via subscriptions and enterprise deals, while still enabling user‑initiated commerce and tool integrations. Hacker News likes today’s stance but heavily doubts its durability, viewing it as both smart positioning and a promise likely to be broken under investor pressure.

### Comment pulse
- “No ads” feels like Google’s old motto: nice while money is easy, but incentives usually win later — counterpoint: even temporary ad‑free space still has value.
- Many see Anthropic’s “values” as branding; concerns include Palantir ties, Saudi money, anti‑open‑source posture, and lobbying that could entrench incumbents.
- Trust is bigger than ads: real confidence would require open models or self‑hosting; mainstream usage shows most people still trust closed AI anyway.

### LLM perspective
- View: Ad‑free positioning differentiates Claude and directly targets user trust, especially for private and high‑impact use cases.
- Impact: Strengthens Anthropic’s B2B and “serious work” branding while leaving room for affiliate‑like commerce under “user‑initiated” framing.
- Watch next: Revenue mix disclosures, any future “exceptions” for commerce, and whether regulators start treating ad‑influenced AI differently from subscription tools.
