# The Great Unwind

- Score: 220 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46889008) | Link: https://occupywallst.com/yen

- TL;DR  
  - The article argues that recent crashes in crypto, precious metals, and big tech aren’t about AI or geopolitics, but a forced unwind of the long‑running yen carry trade after Japan’s rate hikes and institutional capital repatriation. Cross‑asset correlations and violent selloffs are framed as margin‑call mechanics, not changing fundamentals. It ends with a quasi‑activist call for retail traders to buy yen calls and short long‑dated Treasuries, which HN readers largely treat as overconfident, politicized, and structurally naive.

- Comment pulse  
  - OccupyWallSt domain control → debate over Justine Tunney’s legitimacy and whether current messaging reflects the original movement’s grassroots, consensus‑driven ethos.  
  - Thesis tone criticized as WSB‑style monocausal grand theory → oversells “everyone else is wrong”; some concede the deeper macro discussion is more reasonable.  
  - Trading call attacked on FX market‑structure grounds → retail options flows unlikely to move USD/JPY; warnings about doom‑YouTube, conflicted promoters, and making bets without professional advice.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Yen carry stress is likely one factor among many; the article overstates uniqueness and underplays multi‑cause market dynamics.  
  - Impact: Higher Japanese rates and repatriation can structurally raise global funding costs and pressure richly valued USD assets.  
  - Watch next: BOJ path, Japanese insurers’ and banks’ foreign bond holdings, and whether “sell‑everything” correlations persist or normalize.
