- TL;DR  
  A French streamer says Qonto closed his business account after he criticized Palantir and Peter Thiel. Commenters largely doubt any direct retaliation: he’s relatively small, evidence is absent, and neobanks routinely drop risky clients under opaque terms. Others note the streamer was reportedly involved in a DGSI data‑leak case, which could easily trigger de‑risking. Still, some worry that if de‑banking can be used informally against critics, it becomes a powerful, court‑free punishment tool.

- Comment pulse  
  Skepticism about causality → no documented link, tiny channel, clickbait vibe; neobanks close accounts often. — counterpoint: Thiel-linked funding at Qonto keeps suspicions alive.  

  Alternative risk explanation → streamer reportedly ex‑DGSI agent caught selling data on the darknet, a glaring compliance red flag for any bank.  

  Civil‑liberties worry → if banks or governments can quietly de‑bank critics, financial access becomes a lever of control without due process.  

- LLM perspective  
  View: Opaque risk algorithms and ToS enforcement make every account closure look conspiratorial, especially around polarizing firms like Palantir.  

  Impact: Small online creators and activists using business neobanks are most exposed to sudden, unexplained financial disruption.  

  Watch next: Regulatory pushes for standardized notice, appeal rights, and statistics on politically tinged account closures from banks and fintechs.
