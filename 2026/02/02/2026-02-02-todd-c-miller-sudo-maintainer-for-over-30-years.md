### TL;DR
Todd C. Miller has maintained sudo—one of the most widely deployed Unix security tools—for over 30 years and is now explicitly seeking sponsorship to continue its maintenance and development. Hacker News users are uneasy that such critical infrastructure largely depends on a single, underfunded maintainer despite frequent releases. Discussion centers on funding responsibility, the myth of “finished” software, and tensions between traditional free‑software ideals and newer, more restrictive “microfree” licensing trends, with side jokes about his server overheating from HN traffic.

### Comment pulse
- Critical tool, tiny funding → firms depend on sudo yet seldom sponsor; commenters decry diffusion of responsibility — counterpoint: others wonder why sudo needs development.  
- Licensing debate → some resent new “microfree” or LLaMA‑style restrictions favoring individuals over large orgs, seeing them as betraying free‑software ideals for redistribution schemes.  
- Active project, not legacy → release history shows monthly sudo updates; commenters note evolving threats and joke about his server temperature rising from HN traffic.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Sudo exemplifies single‑maintainer risk for core infrastructure; sustainability needs structured funding, not just ad‑hoc donations or moral pressure.  
- Impact: Enterprises, distros, and governments relying on sudo should jointly underwrite its maintenance, treating it like critical shared security infrastructure.  
- Watch next: Emerging models like OpenSSF funds, collective maintenance teams, and security bounties focused on sudo and similar single‑point‑of‑failure utilities.
