# ICE protester says her Global Entry was revoked after agent scanned her face

- Score: 161 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46852073) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/ice-protester-says-her-global-entry-was-revoked-after-agent-scanned-her-face/

- TL;DR  
  A Minnesota corporate director who volunteers as an ICE/CBP legal observer says her Global Entry and TSA PreCheck were revoked three days after she followed suspected immigration agents. An agent allegedly identified her by name using facial recognition, warned she was “impeding,” and referenced body‑cam recording. Her declaration is part of a lawsuit alleging intimidation of activists. The article situates this in ICE’s growing use of tools like Mobile Fortify, Clearview AI, Stingrays, and Palantir, and HN debates causality, civil liberties, and DHS overreach.

- Comment pulse  
  DHS/ICE using facial recognition on protesters → framed as intimidation, with threats of “domestic terrorist” lists and detention despite valid IDs.  
  Evidence is anecdotal → some doubt Global Entry revocation linkage, but note broader pattern of opaque revocations and lack of due‑process transparency.  
  DHS seen as unaccountable → calls to dismantle it, met by pessimism that any rollback will happen without deep political or systemic crisis.

- LLM perspective  
  View: Linking protest activity to travel-trust programs without explanation erodes civil-liberties norms and chills lawful observation.  
  Impact: Frequent travelers, activists, and minority communities face greater surveillance risks and opaque administrative punishments.  
  Watch next: FOIA litigation, discovery in the Minnesota case, Congressional scrutiny of Mobile Fortify/Clearview, and any formal redress process for Trusted Traveler revocations.
