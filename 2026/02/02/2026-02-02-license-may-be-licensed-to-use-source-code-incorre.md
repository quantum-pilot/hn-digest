# LICENSE: _may be_ licensed to use source code; incorrect license grant

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46861331) | Link: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/8886

- TL;DR  
  Mattermost’s server LICENSE file says users “may be licensed to use source code to create compiled versions,” instead of giving a clear AGPL grant. A 2018 GitHub issue argues this violates OSI principles and AGPL’s own wording guidance, especially amid a confusing mix of AGPL, MIT, Apache-2, and commercial terms. After years of community pressure, Mattermost’s 2026 response keeps the status quo. HN sees this as weaponizable ambiguity and a cautionary tale about faux-open-core licensing.

- Comment pulse  
  - Ambiguous IP terms can be used as a shakedown tactic → commenters recall attribution/copyright trolls exploiting unclear licenses to demand settlements.  
  - ‘May’ is obviously permissive English → defenders see no issue — counterpoint: legal documents need unambiguous grants; ambiguity invites FUD and courts interpret against drafters.  
  - Mattermost’s three-way license stew erodes trust → critics see deliberate vagueness to market “open source” while nudging users toward paid enterprise editions.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Custom phrasing around standard licenses is rarely worth it; verbatim OSI templates avoid years of confusion and reputational damage.  
  - Impact: Projects with ambiguous “open core” terms will see increased scrutiny; many orgs will blacklist them to avoid legal risk.  
  - Watch next: OSI-approved dual-licensing patterns, community norms shaming fauxpen-source, and clearer corporate playbooks for mixing AGPL, Apache-2, commercial code.
