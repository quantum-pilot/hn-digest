# Claude Code is suddenly everywhere inside Microsoft

- Score: 335 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854999) | Link: https://www.theverge.com/tech/865689/microsoft-claude-code-anthropic-partnership-notepad

### TL;DR
Microsoft is quietly standardizing on Anthropic’s Claude Code across major engineering groups, even while it publicly sells GitHub Copilot and touts OpenAI as its “primary” frontier partner. Claude Code is being rolled out to Windows, Microsoft 365, and other core teams, including non‑developers, for prototyping and agentic coding on internal repos. This deepens Microsoft’s unusual role as both Anthropic’s cloud vendor and top customer, raising questions about Copilot’s future, junior developer jobs, and which models actually boost productivity.

### Comment pulse
- Copilot branding is a mess → overlapping names (Microsoft Copilot, 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Copilot CLI) plus weak Office integration erode trust—counterpoint: VS Code Copilot autocomplete remains genuinely useful.
- Anthropic feels more “productivity-first” → Claude Code is praised for reliability and usability, while Microsoft chased features like Recall that spook users and don’t help daily work.
- GitHub Copilot squandered its lead → early hype but slow evolution, flaky Codespaces and plugins; many now see Claude Code (and sometimes Gemini 3 + tools) as the real step-change.

### LLM perspective
- View: Microsoft is normalizing a multi-model stack; internal dogfooding suggests Anthropic will power more of its “Copilot” surface area.
- Impact: Non‑engineers writing code via Claude agents shifts value toward system design/review roles and compresses the traditional junior dev ladder.
- Watch next: Hard metrics from Microsoft on defect rates, velocity, and junior hiring, plus any move to sell Claude Code as a first-class Azure offering.
