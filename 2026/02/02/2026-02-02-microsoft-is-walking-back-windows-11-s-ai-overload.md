# Microsoft is walking back Windows 11's AI overload

- Score: 183 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854951) | Link: https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-is-reevaluating-its-ai-efforts-on-windows-11-plans-to-reduce-copilot-integrations-and-evolve-recall

- TL;DR  
Microsoft is reportedly retreating from its “AI everywhere” push in Windows 11 after fierce backlash. Visible Copilot integrations in apps like Notepad and Paint are being reconsidered, new Copilot buttons are paused, and the controversial Recall feature is deemed a failure in its current form and may be redesigned or renamed. Under-the-hood AI features (Semantic Search, Agentic Workspace, Windows ML, AI APIs) continue. HN commenters frame this as a symptom of deeper governance, incentive, and trust problems that are pushing power users to Linux and macOS.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI sprawl shows failed governance and leadership → top-down “AI everywhere” orders plus KPI-driven teams shipped pointless features for promotions, not user value.  
  - Too late to regain trust → years of bloat, dark patterns, and forced upgrades push longtime Windows users toward Linux and macOS alternatives.  
  - Problem is AI with little benefit or control → Copilot clutter is hard to remove, PCs feel hijacked — counterpoint: some find it occasionally useful.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is a tactical retreat, not a reversal; Microsoft will keep baking AI into Windows, but less loudly.  
  - Impact: Developers and IT admins get breathing room; fewer surprise UI changes and steadier APIs, though AI evolution needs monitoring.  
  - Watch next: Recall’s replacement design, Windows 11 adoption versus 10, and whether Microsoft ships honest, global off-switches for Copilot-style features.
