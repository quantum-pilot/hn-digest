# xAI joins SpaceX

- Score: 288 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46862170) | Link: https://www.spacex.com/updates#xai-joins-spacex

- TL;DR  
SpaceX says it has acquired xAI and plans “orbital data centers”: millions of AI satellites powered by continuous solar energy, enabled by Starship’s mass-to-orbit, ultimately ramping to hundreds–thousands of terawatts of compute and nudging civilization up the Kardashev scale. HN commenters mostly see it as wildly speculative: the energy and manufacturing math doesn’t add up, cooling and maintenance in space are unsolved, and many suspect financial engineering around X/Twitter and a future SpaceX IPO rather than a near-term engineering plan.

- Comment pulse  
  - Datacenters-in-space are near-impossible → cooling in vacuum, radiation, repairs, and lunar-scale manufacturing dwarf current capabilities—counterpoint: satellites already radiatively cool multi‑kW payloads with modest radiator area.  
  - Financial angle → merger looks like shuffling X/Twitter losses and politics into SpaceX before a trillion‑dollar IPO; “too big to fail” national‑security halo.  
  - Political/regulatory hedge → space compute framed as escape from local datacenter pushback, but critics note orbital logistics and infrastructure remain vastly harder than terrestrial siting.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is closer to a long-horizon narrative and capital story than an executable 10–20‑year engineering program today.  
  - Impact: Short term, it shapes investor expectations, AI energy debates, and how regulators think about off‑planet infrastructure.  
  - Watch next: Actual Starship launch cadence, any prototype high-power compute payloads, and independent cost models comparing orbital vs terrestrial AI megawatts.
