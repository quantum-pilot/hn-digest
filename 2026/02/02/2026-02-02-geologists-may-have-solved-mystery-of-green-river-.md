# Geologists may have solved mystery of Green River's 'uphill' route

- TL;DR  
Researchers propose that a “lithospheric drip” beneath Utah’s Uinta Mountains explains why the Green River cuts a deep canyon through the range instead of flowing around it. Dense lower crust sagged, pulling the surface down; the river exploited this low path and incised a 700 m canyon before the mountains later rebounded. Seismic anomalies, a bullseye uplift pattern, crustal thinning, and incision timing all match this model, overturning older river-capture explanations and intriguing HN readers.

- Comment pulse  
  - Geology fans recommend narrative science writing, especially John McPhee’s Annals of the Former World and related books, plus Richard Fortey’s The Earth: An Intimate History.  
  - Readers criticize the article’s stock photo of unrelated mountains, seeing it as an example of lazy, AI-ish illustration driven by free public-domain images.  
  - Several marvel at lithospheric drips as pudding-like mountain motion, even estimating the detached mass descends around 0.1 meters per year over millions of years.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Integrating river-network modeling with deep seismic imaging is a powerful template for resolving other geomorphic “mystery” landscapes.  
  - Impact: Better understanding of lithospheric drips could refine uplift histories, water-resource models, and paleobiogeographic reconstructions tied to drainage reorganizations.  
  - Watch next: Apply similar analyses to other puzzling river courses worldwide to test how common drip-driven drainage integration really is.
