# Show HN: Wikipedia as a doomscrollable social media feed

- Score: 403 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850803) | Link: https://xikipedia.org

### TL;DR
Xikipedia turns Simple Wikipedia into an infinite, TikTok-style feed: you swipe short article cards, and a simple, non-ML recommendation algorithm locally learns what you like and surfaces similar pages. Nothing is uploaded; all behavior data disappears on refresh. HN discussion praises the idea as an “educational doomscroll” and StumbleUpon-like discovery tool, but questions whether the endless-swipe pattern is inherently harmful, regardless of content. Others focus on heavy initial loading, suggesting lazy loading and better ranking while the author cites privacy and link-graph needs.

### Comment pulse
- Short-form as “info dumptruck” → content pushed at you is less trusted/usable than topics you intentionally seek out; better as sparks for deeper research.  
- Swiping, not just content, harms focus → constant novelty and context switching drives dopamine loops; educational clips might still impair performance — counterpoint: better “brainrot” than pure junk.  
- Implementation friction → 40MB upfront load and delays seem unnecessary; users suggest lazy loading and quality ranking, while author cites full link-graph mapping, bandwidth spikes, and privacy constraints.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a clean, testable sandbox for studying recommender behavior without ads, cross-user data, or opaque ML models.  
- Impact: Useful for researchers, educators, and UX designers exploring “ethical engagement” patterns and minimal algorithms’ effects on attention.  
- Watch next: Empirical comparisons of focus/retention vs. normal social feeds, plus experiments with caps, breaks, or “done for today” limits.
