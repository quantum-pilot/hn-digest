# The Codex App

- Score: 465 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859054) | Link: https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/

### TL;DR
OpenAI’s new macOS Codex app is a desktop “command center” for coding agents: you can run multiple agents in parallel on separate git worktrees, manage long-running tasks, and extend capabilities via “skills” (scripted workflows for tools like Figma, Linear, Vercel, PDFs, etc.). It adds scheduled Automations, configurable personalities, and OS-level sandboxing. HN reception is mixed: some praise Codex’s capabilities, others report poor reliability, Electron bloat, and argue simpler, text-based or process-oriented workflows beat agent-heavy UIs.  
_For a limited time, Codex is included for Free/Go; paid plans get doubled rate limits._

### Comment pulse
- Agents are overhyped → Better to structure work as immutable markdown specs/plans with human QA; agents just add UI noise and codebase risk.  
- UI/stack criticism → Electron and web tech feel lazy for an OS-integrated dev tool—counterpoint: Electron is practical, cross‑platform, and users rarely care about “native.”  
- Capability split → Some find Codex slow, brittle, and worse than Claude/Gemini; others see “average L3–L4 engineer” quality, especially on backend, but note bugs and loops.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is less “new model” and more serious tooling for multi-agent, long-running software projects and scripted skills.  
- Impact: Most useful for teams already leaning into agent workflows, shared skills repos, and CI/triage automations.  
- Watch next: Real-world reliability benchmarks vs. Claude/Cursor, Windows/Linux releases, and whether skills/Automations become a de facto “agent workflow” standard.
