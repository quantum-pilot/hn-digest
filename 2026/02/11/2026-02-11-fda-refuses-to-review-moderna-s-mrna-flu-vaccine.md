# FDA refuses to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine

## TL;DR
The FDA, now overseen by RFK Jr.’s administration, has refused to even review Moderna’s mRNA-1010 flu vaccine, saying its 41,000-person phase 3 trial wasn’t “adequate and well-controlled” because it used standard-dose vaccines like Fluarix instead of the “best-available” flu shot. Moderna says FDA had twice preapproved this design and notes similar comparators were accepted for other flu vaccines, while foreign regulators are reviewing the product. Critics see growing politicization and a chilling effect on US vaccine innovation.

## LLM perspective
- View: Novel “best-available standard” requirement, applied retroactively, makes US regulatory environment look arbitrary rather than evidence-based.  
- Impact: Companies may prioritize EU/Canada approvals first, delay US launches, or redesign trials around moving, politically influenced targets.  
- Watch next: Watch for Moderna appeals, possible lawsuits, advisory committee resignations, and whether other mRNA or pediatric products face similar refusals.
