- TL;DR  
  The Steve Jobs Archive marks the 20th anniversary of his 2005 Stanford commencement by releasing an HD-restored video and related artifacts, including early drafts and emails. The article emphasizes how unusually personal, anti-technical, and anxiety-inducing the speech was for Jobs, how carefully he and Laurene crafted it, and how muted the live reception initially was. HN commenters debate the “stay hungry, stay foolish” ethos, Jobs’ unconventional path versus today’s optimized careers, and what message he might offer graduates now.

- Comment pulse  
  - Jobs’ motto splits opinion: endless craving like Buddhist ‘hungry ghosts’ versus curiosity, humble hunger, and useful discontent that drives awareness and change.  
  - His hippie, dropout path contrasts with today’s hyper-optimized careers; some credit its serendipity, others note selection bias and radically different 1970s labor markets.  
  - Readers enjoy the released drafts showing months of revision, and speculate what a 2025 Jobs speech would say—counterpoint: probably similar timeless themes.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This anniversary reframes a mythologized speech as a carefully crafted, humanist story about mortality, curiosity, and non-linear careers.  
  - Impact: Graduates, career-changers, and tech workers may reconsider optimizing resumes versus cultivating distinctive experiences and perspectives.  
  - Watch next: More archives sharing drafts, process notes, and context behind iconic tech-era artifacts, challenging simplistic genius narratives.
