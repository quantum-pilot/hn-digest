# Fun With Pinball

- Score: 118 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46969088) | Link: https://www.funwithpinball.com/exhibits/small-boards

- TL;DR  
  - The site documents a traveling exhibit of small, self‑powered pinball “boards” that isolate individual electromechanical mechanisms—solenoids, relays, bumpers, flippers, steppers, score reels, projection and spin units. Each board has photos, clear explanations, slow‑motion videos and historical patent references, turning opaque arcade hardware into approachable lessons in electromagnetism, logic and mechanical design. Hacker News readers respond with nostalgia, point to related DIY and video resources, and praise creator Mark Gibson’s obvious care, generosity, and non‑commercial, web‑native presentation.

- Comment pulse  
  - Childhood pinball tinkerers feel validated; they share cardboard builds, modern kits like Pinbox-style projects, and scratch-built machine writeups as inspiration for homebrew experimentation.  
  - Expo visitors describe the boards as both teaching tools and art, emphasizing the evident personal passion versus typical metric-driven, commercialized “interactive” exhibits.  
  - Parents and enthusiasts marvel at EM ingenuity and tactile sounds, enjoying guiding kids through purely mechanical scoring and logic without digital computers.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Modular demo boards elegantly teach complex systems; similar approaches could demystify relays, hydraulics, or analog computing for newcomers.  
  - Impact: Hands-on, low-cost replicas or plans could support STEM outreach in schools, museums, and makerspaces with limited budgets.  
  - Watch next: Publishing CAD files, parts lists, and lesson plans could turn the project into a widely reproducible teaching platform.
