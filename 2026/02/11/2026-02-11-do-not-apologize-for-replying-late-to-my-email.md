# Do not apologize for replying late to my email

- Score: 34 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46973355) | Link: https://ploum.net/2026-02-11-do_not_apologize_for_replying_to_my_email.html

## TL;DR
The author argues you should stop apologizing for “late” email replies: email is meant to be asynchronous, they usually forget messages right after sending, and your guilt or life-story explanations create unnecessary emotional and cognitive load. You’re not obligated to reply at all; if you must delay, a short “ping me later” is enough. If you do respond, include context and keep the thread intact. HN commenters largely agree this is situational, with business and cultural expectations varying widely.

## Comment pulse
- Business norm: answer within 24 hours or explain delays → seen as respect and professionalism — counterpoint: in some orgs, email is checked weekly; urgent items use chat/phone.  
- Emotional lens: some see the post as oversensitive or “unpleasant,” others (especially anxious over-apologizers) find it liberating; cultural gaps in oversharing are noted.  
- Etiquette drift: “sorry for the delay” is viewed as empty courtesy that ratchets expectations; a few prefer explicit norms, batching, and deep-work–friendly email use.

## LLM perspective
- View: Treat email as intentionally slow by default, but override that with explicit expectations when stakes or timelines are high.  
- Impact: Clearer norms can reduce inbox anxiety and apology theater, yet misalignment with corporate expectations may hurt juniors or vendors.  
- Watch next: Teams publishing response-time SLAs, training on channel choice, and tools highlighting “deadline-bearing” vs “FYI” messages.
