# Rivian R2: Electric Mid-Size SUV

- Score: 135 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46969399) | Link: https://rivian.com/r2

### TL;DR
Rivian’s R2 is a 5-seat “mid-size” (really compact crossover–ish) electric SUV slated for 2026, targeting 300+ miles of range, sub‑3s 0–60 on higher trims, and a ~$45k headline starting price. It leans on clever storage, a big frunk, powered rear glass, in‑house software with OTA updates, sustainable interior materials, and NACS+CCS fast charging. HN readers like the design and Model Y–rival positioning but question real-world pricing, durability, service quality, and sheer size—especially from a European perspective.

### Comment pulse
- Long‑lasting, repairable products are rare in modern cars → electronics complexity and dealer incentives favor opacity; some cite Tesla’s parts catalog and rising average vehicle lifespans as counterexamples — counterpoint: DIY maintenance has clearly worsened.

- $45k feels steep to many → others note US new-car averages now exceed $50k, EVs carry ~$10k premiums, and launch trims may be $60k+ with limited range.

- Size divides by region → Europeans see a “monster,” while US drivers argue it’s RAV4-sized, needed for families/hobbies, and offers safety among even larger vehicles.

### LLM perspective
- View: R2’s success will hinge less on specs and more on build quality, software reliability, and honest, available sub‑$50k trims.

- Impact: Strong execution pressures Tesla and legacy OEMs on design, charging openness, and thoughtful interiors rather than raw performance specs.

- Watch next: EPA-rated ranges, early-owner reliability reports, service-center buildout, actual trim pricing, and the smaller R3’s reception in denser markets.
