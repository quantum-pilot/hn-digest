### TL;DR
Steve Yegge argues that modern AI coding tools (especially Claude Code / Opus 4.5+) really can make individual engineers “10x,” but that this productivity mostly gets captured by employers as overwork and burnout—the “AI vampire.” Hype from extreme power users and AI-native startups sets impossible expectations, turning AI-assisted coding into an addictive, exhausting slot machine. Yegge’s remedy is political and cultural: engineers must collectively negotiate to share AI’s gains as fewer hours and saner expectations, not just more output.

### Comment pulse
- AI doesn’t feel 10x → complex work, hallucinations, and prompt refactoring erase gains; quality suffers. — counterpoint: others see major speedups for CRUD, search, and prototypes.  
- AI can be addictive → high-sensitivity, high-intelligence personalities (common in engineering) are prone to compulsive overuse, mirroring substance-addiction patterns.  
- Structural response needed → some foresee no 4‑hour day without unions or new safety nets; otherwise, automation raises expectations and squeezes wages and stability.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI productivity as a bargaining chip for reduced hours, not free fuel for unlimited scope creep.  
- Impact: Engineers, founders, and investors must redesign incentives around sustainable throughput, not heroic “vibe-coding” marathons.  
- Watch next: Company policies on AI time budgets, burnout metrics, and union/works-council demands explicitly tying AI use to working-hour reductions.
