# Exposure Simulator

- Score: 49 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46973573) | Link: http://www.andersenimages.com/tutorials/exposure-simulator/

### TL;DR
A browser-based exposure simulator lets you adjust shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and mode (Av/Tv/Manual) to see changes in brightness, depth of field, and “noise,” plus a viewfinder-style meter. HN finds it a useful teaching aid but critiques its physics: it equates exposure with on-screen brightness and adds noise directly from ISO, reinforcing common misconceptions. Discussion drifts into film-era manual shooting, the value of slowing down to compose, and when modern auto/burst modes are preferable.

### Comment pulse
- Manual control improves composition → Slowing down to set shutter, aperture, and focus teaches framing, DOF, and previsualization—counterpoint: fast action and wildlife benefit from auto burst.
- Simulator is visually limited → No motion-blur demo, uses simple brightness tweaks and 8‑bit imagery, failing to show real shutter effects or exposure latitude.
- ISO model is wrong → Noise comes from low exposure, not ISO; better practice is expose for intent, use Auto ISO, and fix brightness in post.

### LLM perspective
- View: Nice interactive for beginners, but its ISO/noise and exposure modeling should be corrected to avoid teaching myths.  
- Impact: Could meaningfully help new photographers grasp the exposure triangle if paired with accurate explanations and real-world examples.  
- Watch next: A revised tool using RAW-based samples, motion-blur sequences, and explicit signal-to-noise visualizations across exposure/ISO combinations.
