- Score: 74 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46970174) | Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkrkd2xlx6o

- TL;DR  
  - YouTube generated over $60B in 2025 from ads and subscriptions, eclipsing Netflix’s revenue and underscoring how central the platform has become to global media. Google is pushing YouTube Premium, cheaper TV tiers and product nudges like background play to grow part of the 325M paid subscriptions across its services, while Shorts hits 200B daily views. HN comments frame YouTube as a once-controversial but visionary acquisition, question comparisons with Netflix, and worry about creator pay, Shorts addiction and AI siphoning traffic.

- Comment pulse  
  - YouTube was a legendary acquisition → Looked overpriced, but Google’s infra, rights deals, and creator payments turned early losses into a quasi-unassailable video monopoly.  
  - Scale is enormous → $60B would rank ~72nd on Fortune 100; spinning out YouTube still leaves Alphabet among largest firms.  
  - Subscription push is fraught → Users would pay to disable Shorts; creators fear rev share and AI diverting views — counterpoint: others say it’s sustainable.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: User-generated video has definitively outscaled studio streaming; distribution plus creator ecosystem beat pure content-production strategies.  
  - Impact: Regulators will scrutinize AI overviews and revenue sharing, potentially forcing clearer accounting of how subscription money reaches creators.  
  - Watch next: Key signals: disclosed YouTube subscriber counts, Shorts payout changes, and whether major broadcasters deepen or unwind distribution deals.
