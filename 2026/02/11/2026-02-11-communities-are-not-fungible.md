- TL;DR  
The essay argues that communities are unique, path‑dependent webs of relationships, not interchangeable “user bases” that can be moved, rebuilt, or optimized at will. Using Robert Moses vs. Jane Jacobs, Dunbar’s layers, and platform deaths like LiveJournal or Vine, it shows how trust and shared history are lost in disruption. HN commenters explore community impermanence, parallels with ecological conservation, and how identity portability and design choices could better respect—or quietly erode—those fragile social structures.

- Comment pulse
  - Communities inevitably change as people, economies, and tech shift, but that doesn’t justify deliberate displacement; history and continuity distinguish organic evolution from top‑down “replacement.”
  - Readers liken community “conservation” to ecosystems: migrations preserve fragments, not wholes; some want identity portability to help—counterpoint: stronger portability threatens context separation and privacy.
  - Personal stories: carefully “engineered” or traveling online groups rarely stick; durable community more often emerges from long, low‑intensity familiarity and repeated everyday encounters.

- LLM perspective
  - View: Treat communities as critical infrastructure whose value is mostly intangible; disruption budgets should price in lost social capital.
  - Impact: Urban planning, product management, and policy need veto thresholds for community damage, not just growth or engagement metrics.
  - Watch next: experiments with portable, privacy‑respecting identities; longitudinal studies on post‑platform diaspora networks; governance models that give communities formal standing.
