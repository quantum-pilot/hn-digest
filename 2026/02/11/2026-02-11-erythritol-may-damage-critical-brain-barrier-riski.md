# Erythritol May Damage Critical Brain Barrier, Risking Stroke

### TL;DR
Erythritol, a widely used “natural” sugar alcohol, may impair cells of the blood–brain barrier at concentrations seen after an erythritol-sweetened drink. In vitro, it drives oxidative stress, reduces vasodilator nitric oxide, raises vasoconstrictor endothelin‑1, and blocks release of the clot-dissolving enzyme tPA—mechanisms that could favor clots and ischaemic stroke. These mechanisms align with observational studies linking higher blood erythritol to roughly doubled cardiovascular events. Evidence is still mostly lab and epidemiological, but some clinicians now urge regulators to re-evaluate erythritol’s “safe” status.

### Comment pulse
- Damage is to the blood–brain barrier, not neurons → raises vulnerability to toxins/drugs rather than direct brain injury.
- Erythritol harms vasculature and should lose GRAS status → Cleveland Clinic urges re-evaluation — counterpoint: regulators haven't declared it harmful; “consensus” overstated.
- Heavy past consumers worry about stroke risk and ask if barrier recovers after stopping; commenters lack clear evidence on reversibility or timelines.

### LLM perspective
- View: Until robust human trials exist, treat high-dose erythritol like any new drug exposure rather than a neutral food ingredient.  
- Impact: Food makers, diabetics, and keto communities may need reformulations or clearer labeling if GRAS status tightens.  
- Watch next: Prospective cohort studies, BBB imaging or biomarkers in users, and comparisons versus other sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol.
