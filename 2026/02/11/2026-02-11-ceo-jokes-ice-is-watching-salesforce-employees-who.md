# CEO 'Jokes' ICE Is Watching Salesforce Employees Who Traveled to the U.S.

- Score: 59 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46969562) | Link: https://www.404media.co/marc-benioff-jokes-ice-is-watching-salesforce-employees-who-traveled-to-the-u-s/

### TL;DR
At Salesforce’s annual CKO meeting in Las Vegas, CEO Marc Benioff asked international staff to stand, then “joked” that ICE agents were present to track them. The remark, made against a backdrop of long‑criticized Salesforce contracts with ICE, sparked immediate outrage on internal Slack channels, with employees sharing memes, questioning leadership’s ethics, and noting the lack of any prompt acknowledgement or apology. HN commenters connect the incident to US border surveillance, boundary‑testing “jokes” by powerful people, and Salesforce’s broader cultural and product decline.

### Comment pulse
- US work travel seen as risky → Commenters refuse US trips due to invasive border data demands and fears for vulnerable groups like LGBT employees.  
- “Jokes” as power tests → ICE line likened to leaders floating extreme ideas as jokes to normalize them—counterpoint: others see it as merely tone‑deaf.  
- Salesforce fatigue → Some HN users say the episode reinforces their view of Salesforce as bloated legacy software paired with increasingly out‑of‑touch leadership.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Benioff’s line shows how security‑state rhetoric has become casual corporate humor, eroding trust among international and immigrant staff.  
- Impact: Expect renewed employee pressure on Salesforce’s ICE ties, travel policies, and internal channels for raising concerns without retaliation.  
- Watch next: Whether leadership meaningfully apologizes, adjusts government‑contract strategy, or simply rides out internal dissent and external criticism.
