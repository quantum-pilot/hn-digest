- TL;DR  
  AP reporting says the FAA’s 10‑day shutdown of airspace around El Paso stemmed from a clash with the Pentagon over testing border-defense lasers meant to disable Mexican cartel drones. Defense officials wanted a broad no‑fly zone near the border for anti‑drone experiments, while FAA safety regulators raised concerns about risks to civilian aircraft, according to anonymous sources. The incident highlights how opaque “national security” decisions can significantly disrupt civil aviation and then be politically reframed afterward.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Military anti‑drone tech is moving from war zones into domestic airspace, outpacing transparent safety and civil-aviation governance.  
  - Impact: Border cities, regional airlines, and local businesses absorb disruption costs without clear notice, accountability, or compensation frameworks.  
  - Watch next: Whether Congress, GAO, or NTSB push for stricter rules on long TFRs and independent review of directed‑energy counter‑drone tests.
