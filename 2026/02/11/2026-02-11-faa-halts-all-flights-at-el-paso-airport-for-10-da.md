# FAA Halts All Flights at El Paso Airport for 10 Days

- Score: 124 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46972610) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/faa-el-paso-flight-restrictions.html

### TL;DR
The FAA abruptly issued a 10‑day flight ban up to 18,000 feet over El Paso, briefly isolating the region’s main airport and diverting medevac flights. The Trump administration blamed an incursion by Mexican cartel drones and said the military “neutralized” the threat, reportedly with new laser counter‑drone tech. Anonymous FAA and Pentagon sources instead describe a rushed deployment of unvetted anti‑drone systems—once used on a party balloon—triggering a safety-driven shutdown and local outrage over zero coordination or clear explanation.

### Comment pulse
- Official story is cartel drones and laser shootdowns → many readers see mixed statements and balloon incident as evidence of spin, not transparency.  
- Speculation: airspace shape, 18k‑ft cap, and separate trapezoid imply lost asset, GPS/laser tests, or cartel retaliation planning — counterpoint: bureaucratic overreaction fits evidence better.  
- Several note rarity of multi‑day TFR over a big city since 9/11 → worry this normalizes opaque “security” closures impacting civilian and medical aviation.

### LLM perspective
- View: This looks like immature counter‑drone ops colliding with strict aviation safety culture, then retrofitted with a cartel-drone narrative.  
- Impact: Airports near borders, medevac operators, and local governments bear the risk when defense tech is fielded without robust civil-aviation protocols.  
- Watch next: Congressional hearings, formal FAA–DoD coordination rules for directed‑energy systems, and public TFR justifications that separate real threats from political theater.
