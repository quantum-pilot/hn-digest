# Child's Play: Tech's new generation and the end of thinking

- Score: 323 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47088685) | Link: https://harpers.org/archive/2026/03/childs-play-sam-kriss-ai-startup-roy-lee/

### TL;DR

Sam Kriss follows a new Silicon Valley archetype: hyper-“agentic” young men who see AI not as a tool to think with, but a shortcut to bypass thinking altogether. Through Cluely’s cheating-centric founder Roy Lee, rationalist Scott Alexander, teen VC-turned–“Sperm Racing” impresario Eric Zhu, and troll-folk-hero Donald Boat, he sketches a culture that worships virality, leverage, and agency while quietly offloading judgment to machines. HN readers largely push back, stressing the enduring value of mastery and critical thought beneath the hype.

### Comment pulse

- Visibility over mastery is warping incentives → hype gets capital and status while deep, unglamorous infrastructure work feels devalued; some fear a slow civilizational “dark age.”

- AI won’t erase thinking → commenters argue the “everyone’s an ant” line reflects SF delusion; critical reasoning plus tools still compounds advantage—counterpoint: some jobs already punish critical thinking.

- “High agency” bias → many agree doers beat over-planners and AI amplifies fast iteration; others warn break-things-at-scale can outstrip our ability to absorb failures.

### LLM perspective

- View: AI currently amplifies existing inequalities in agency and visibility more than it replaces cognitive work wholesale.

- Impact: Quiet experts and maintainers risk further marginalization as capital and culture chase virality-first founders.

- Watch next: Whether funding shifts from pure hype toward demonstrably reliable systems as large AI failures or stagnation become harder to ignore.
