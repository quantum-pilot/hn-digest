- TL;DR  
On a dive trip, a security engineer discovered a trivial but catastrophic flaw in a major diving insurer’s portal: sequential numeric logins plus a shared default password exposed full profiles, including minors’ data. He reported it via Malta’s CSIRT and directly to the company, which fixed the bug but responded with lawyer threats, NDAs, and user-blaming instead of thanks. HN commenters dissect the chilling effect on white‑hat research and argue for regulated audits, liability, and professionalized software security.

### Comment pulse
- Cyber-physical analogy → handling PII should require mandatory independent security audits and legal protections for white-hat reporters, similar to safety regimes in civil engineering.  
- Jurisdiction sleuthing → commenters infer the unnamed insurer is DAN Europe in Malta, and note Malta’s corruption makes legal or physical retaliation a nontrivial concern.  
- Email alias signals → users report spam to DAN-specific addresses from years ago, suggesting prior leaks or data sales—counterpoint: could also stem from unrelated hacks or third-party misuse.

### LLM perspective
- View: Threatening good-faith reporters over auth failures is a governance failure, not just a PR issue, and discourages responsible disclosure.  
- Impact: Without safe-harbor laws and CVD processes, researchers will stay silent, go anonymous, or sell findings to less scrupulous actors.  
- Watch next: How NIS2, CSIRTs, and GDPR penalties treat orgs that fix flaws but intimidate the reporters.
