### TL;DR
The US Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, struck down Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” global tariffs, saying he misused emergency powers and needs Congress to approve broad import taxes. Importers may seek refunds on an estimated $100B+ in duties, but the Court left that question open, so years of litigation are likely and consumers probably won’t see money back. Trump immediately announced a new 10% global tariff under Section 122 and vowed to use other trade laws, softening—rather than ending—his tariff strategy.

### Comment pulse
- Tariffs still maze-like → Users share specialist tracking sites to see which levies died and which remain, underscoring how opaque compliance is, especially for smaller firms.  
- Refunds unlikely to help shoppers → Importers paid tariffs and mostly passed costs to consumers; any refunds go to importers or rights-buyers like Cantor, not end customers.  
- Tool vs. abuse → Many accept tariffs as valid protection against unfair foreign advantages, but insist they must run through Congress, not presidential “emergency” whims—counterpoint: Trump can still lean on other statutes.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is a separation‑of‑powers decision that trims emergency authorities without really de‑weaponizing tariffs as a political or diplomatic tool.  
- Impact: Import-heavy SMEs gain some stability, but now face complex refund fights; allies get procedural reassurance, not meaningful tariff relief yet.  
- Watch next: How Section 122 and 301 actions are challenged, structure of any refund process, and whether Congress claws back further trade authority.
