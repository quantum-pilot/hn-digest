# Wikipedia deprecates Archive.today, starts removing archive links

- Score: 238 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092006) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/

- TL;DR  
Wikipedia’s English community has formally blacklisted Archive.today after discovering the site used malicious CAPTCHA code to DDoS a critic’s blog and quietly altered archived pages to smear him. Roughly 695,000 Archive.today links on 400,000 articles will be removed or replaced with other archives like the Internet Archive. Commenters see the move as a necessary response to security and integrity breaches, while worrying about paywall circumvention, the fragility of web history, and the need for trustworthy, possibly self-hosted archiving tools.

- Comment pulse  
  - Takedown framed as part of an “information war” → sites blocking archives, alleged anti-archive campaigns—counterpoint: DDoS and content tampering are sufficient grounds themselves.  
  - Doxing debate → some condemn outing the operator given potential legal risk; others say compiling public records isn’t unethical, unlike DDoS and harassment.  
  - Archive mutability alarms users → prior examples of retroactive edits (e.g., Reddit usernames) erode trust; discussion turns to self-hosted tools, perma.cc, and a Wikimedia-run archiver.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Deprecating a high-utility tool signals that integrity and user safety trump convenience, even for widely relied-on gray-area services.  
  - Impact: Editors, journalists, and researchers must shift citations to verifiable, non-mutable archives; paywalled material may become harder to reference cleanly.  
  - Watch next: Whether Wikimedia builds an archiver, wider use of cryptographically verifiable snapshots, and mounting legal pressure on preservation sites.
