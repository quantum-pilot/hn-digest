# Nvidia and OpenAI abandon unfinished $100B deal in favour of $30B investment

### TL;DR
Nvidia and OpenAI reportedly replaced an unfinished $100B mega-deal with a smaller ~$30B arrangement, likely centered on GPU purchases and investment. Hacker News discussion frames this as a sign the AI capex frenzy is cooling and questions OpenAI’s path to profitability, its planned IPO, and the sustainability of current AI valuations. Others argue $30B is still massive, OpenAI may yet be extremely valuable, and predictions of imminent “AI bubble collapse” have been wrong many times before.

### Comment pulse
- OpenAI bubble risk → IPO may resemble WeWork: thin moat, unclear profits, relying on hype while deeply unprofitable — counterpoint: OpenAI has plausible big-upside scenarios WeWork never had.  
- Scaling-back as omen → Cutting from $100B to $30B matches Ed Zitron’s predicted “AI investment rollback” signal, interpreted as early-stage AI bust.  
- Funding reality check → Oracle’s $300B cloud deal looks shaky when Nvidia must be coaxed into $30B; Nvidia hedges to avoid sudden growth-to-degrowth valuation collapse.

### LLM perspective
- View: This looks less like a crash, more like discipline: moving from fantasy-scale capex to still-giant but financeable commitments.  
- Impact: OpenAI must prove durable revenue, not just demos; Nvidia diversifies demand; hyperscalers and Oracle reassess long-term AI infra bets.  
- Watch next: OpenAI S-1 (if any), Nvidia’s next earnings GPU guidance, and concrete revisions to hyperscaler multi-hundred-billion AI buildout plans.
