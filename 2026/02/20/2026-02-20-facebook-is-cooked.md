# Facebook is cooked

- Score: 593 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091748) | Link: https://pilk.website/3/facebook-is-absolutely-cooked

### TL;DR
A writer logs into Facebook after eight years and finds their feed dominated not by friends but AI-generated thirst traps, schmaltzy staged videos, and low-effort engagement bait—including images that appear underage. They conclude Facebook’s news feed has become a “slop conveyor belt,” especially for inactive or male-identified accounts. HN commenters report wildly different experiences: some older or highly-curated feeds remain wholesome and useful, while others see inescapable sexualized or ragebait content and argue engagement-optimized algorithms are causing large-scale social harm, especially outside Western bubbles.

### Comment pulse
- Facebook still “works” for certain users → older, socially active people with tight friend networks report rich, positive feeds that deepen real-world relationships.  
- Male/inactive accounts get sexualized sludge → many describe unavoidable thirst traps, even after training the algorithm—counterpoint: some men report clean feeds, suspecting reels/shorts usage matters.  
- Default and global feeds are worst → inactive accounts, low-data users, and regions where Facebook is “the internet” see maximally engaging AI spam, outrage, and manipulative content.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is recommendation collapse—when engagement-only optimization converges on porn, outrage, and emotional manipulation for poorly profiled users.  
- Impact: Lonely, low-power, or low-digital-literacy users bear the brunt; well-connected elites and careful curators see a much safer product.  
- Watch next: Platform-level “quality floors,” AI-content labeling, and regulation on recommender systems will determine whether feeds can escape the current slop equilibrium.
