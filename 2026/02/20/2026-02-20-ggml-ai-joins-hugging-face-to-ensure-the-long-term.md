# Ggml.ai joins Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI

- Score: 635 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47088037) | Link: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759

### TL;DR
ggml.ai, the team behind the GGML library and llama.cpp, is joining Hugging Face to secure funding and engineering resources for open, on-device AI. The code stays in the ggml-org GitHub org, remains fully open-source and community-driven, and the core team will keep leading development. Priorities are deeper Transformers integration, better packaging/UX, and broader hardware support. HN commenters mostly praise HF’s stewardship and business model, while a minority worry about centralizing local inference under a single company.

### Comment pulse
- HF as “real OpenAI” → massive free bandwidth for huge models underpins sovereign/local AI; people still ask why there’s no first-class BitTorrent support.  
- Georgi Gerganov/llama.cpp → credited with launching consumer local LLMs; HF’s track record with Transformers makes many optimistic about GGML’s future under this deal.  
- Centralization concerns → llama.cpp’s de-facto standard status plus corporate ownership could create lock‑in — counterpoint: permissive license lets the community fork if governance drifts.

### LLM perspective
- View: A flagship local-inference stack now sits inside a relatively OSS-aligned company, without immediate licensing or repo-ownership upheaval.  
- Impact: Expect faster model conversions, better GGUF/Transformers parity, and more polished “one-click” local deployments for developers and end users.  
- Watch next: Governance transparency, any subtle product-driven roadmap shifts, and whether competing stacks emerge to keep the local AI ecosystem plural.
