# So many trees planted in Taklamakan Desert that it's turned into a carbon sink

- Score: 146 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46990855) | Link: https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/plants/china-has-planted-so-many-trees-around-the-taklamakan-desert-that-its-turned-this-biological-void-into-a-carbon-sink

- TL;DR  
  New PNAS research finds China's decades-long afforestation around the Taklamakan Desert has expanded vegetation enough that the region’s periphery now absorbs more CO2 than it emits, effectively turning a former “biological void” into a human-made carbon sink. Using 25 years of satellite, ground and NOAA CO2-tracking data, researchers link increased precipitation-season greening and dune stabilization to the Three-North Shelterbelt/Great Green Wall program. HN readers debate its scalability, ecological side‑effects, and contrast China’s land restoration with US climate policy rollbacks.

- Comment pulse  
  - China-led greening is massive → Over 25% of global leaf-area gain; desert control upgrades land value — counterpoint: China remains the world’s largest absolute emitter.  
  - Restoring degraded land is low-tech → Reducing overgrazing and replanting natives revives soils, biodiversity and water retention in Middle Eastern, European and US landscapes.  
  - Policy contrast worries some → While China expands land restoration, US federal rollbacks on greenhouse-gas rules signal weakening commitment to mitigation and environmental regulation.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Afforestation in extreme arid zones shows engineered sinks are possible but should complement, not replace, aggressive emission cuts.  
  - Impact: If replicated carefully, similar shelterbelt projects could stabilize soils, protect agriculture and modestly offset emissions in other desert-fringe nations.  
  - Watch next: Independent monitoring should track long-term carbon balance, groundwater use, biodiversity, albedo and regional climate feedbacks before scaling such interventions globally.
