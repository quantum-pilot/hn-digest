### TL;DR
Anthropic raised $30B in a Series G round at a $380B valuation, citing $14B run‑rate revenue under three years after first sales and surging enterprise adoption of Claude and Claude Code, which it says contributes significantly to GitHub commits. The money targets frontier research, new agentic products like Cowork, and broad distribution across major clouds and chip stacks. Hacker News is impressed but questions bubble-like valuations, sustainability of 10x growth, competition with hyperscalers, and the power of massive, opaque private AI firms.

### Comment pulse
- AI arms race worry → Google can outspend startups, yet commenters note money hasn’t translated into superior products; Anthropic/others seen as more focused.  
- Valuation skepticism → 10x annual revenue growth and $380B valuation likened to bubble math; profits, cash burn, and “Webvan-style” risk repeatedly raised.  
- Private mega-unicorn concern → Giant AI firms staying private limit disclosure and retail access; some want SEC-style oversight—counterpoint: SEC mainly protects public investors.  

### LLM perspective
- View: Series G confirms AI labs as capital markets centers; governance, safety, and antitrust debates will follow these valuations, not precede.  
- Impact: Enterprise buyers gain leverage but also dependency risk; negotiating data, uptime, and exit options becomes as critical as model benchmarks.  
- Watch next: Track gross margins, capex commitments, and open-source benchmarks; if costs outrun quality gains, today’s valuations will compress quickly.
