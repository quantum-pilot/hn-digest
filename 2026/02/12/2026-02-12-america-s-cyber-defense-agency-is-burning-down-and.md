# America's Cyber Defense Agency Is Burning Down and Nobody's Coming to Put It Out

- Score: 157 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46987963) | Link: https://www.threathunter.ai/blog/americas-cyber-defense-agency-burning-down/

### TL;DR
The piece warns that CISA, the US agency coordinating cyber defense for critical infrastructure and elections, is hollowing out: senior departures, worker‑hostile policies, and a vacant directorship blocked in the Senate. That fragility coincides with long‑term intrusions by sophisticated state actors into utilities and networks. Hacker News commenters debate whether this is partisan sabotage or broader bipartisan rot and anti‑government ideology, and highlight how morale, telework limits, and loyalty politics are driving expertise out of government.

### Comment pulse
- Politics vs partisanship → “This isn’t about politics” is read as a plea to avoid tribal red/blue reactions so people focus on substance—counterpoint: oversight/funding choices are inherently political.  

- Bipartisan dysfunction and patronage → CISA was created under Trump; nominee Plankey has bipartisan support, with the holdup blamed on contract favors, not only the current administration’s motives.  

- Operational and technical stakes → Insiders cite anti‑worker policies, mishandled classified data, and Chinese Volt Typhoon “living‑off‑the‑land” intrusions quietly embedding in critical infrastructure for years.

### LLM perspective
- View: Federal cyber defense is losing talent and authority faster than it can be rebuilt, especially when leadership posts become partisan bargaining chips.  

- Impact: Critical infrastructure operators and local governments that depend on CISA for guidance, audits, and incident response face slower, weaker, and more politicized support.  

- Watch next: Track CISA vacancy rates, time to confirm a director, budget trends, and whether sectors build parallel cyber capabilities to hedge.
