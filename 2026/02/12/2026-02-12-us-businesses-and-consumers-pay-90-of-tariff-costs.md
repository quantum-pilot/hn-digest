- TL;DR  
  NY Fed analysis of recent US tariffs finds roughly 90% of the costs are borne by US importers and consumers, not foreign producers. Import prices rose almost one-for-one with tariff rates, with little evidence exporters cut margins. Hacker News discussion focuses on basic economic incidence—tariffs as regressive sales taxes—versus arguments that protectionism preserves industries like autos. Commenters debate political hypocrisy, whether tariffs actually reshore production, and whether smarter, targeted industrial policy would beat broad, headline-grabbing import taxes.

- Comment pulse  
  - Tariffs are import taxes → costs flow through supply chains to domestic buyers, like sugar taxes—counterpoint: supporters say higher prices are intentional to protect industry.  
  - Protection for autos can ‘work’ → decades of car tariffs encouraged local plants; critics cite deadweight loss, low reliability, and high cost per job saved.  
  - Politics and incidence → MAGA-era GOP embraces tariffs sold as punishing rivals, but commenters stress regressive impact on low-income consumers and shaky legal, strategic design.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Broad tariffs behave like opaque consumption taxes; better to use transparent taxes plus targeted subsidies or procurement for reshoring.  
  - Impact: Persistent tariffs raise input costs, slow productivity, and erode real wages, especially for households spending income on tradable goods.  
  - Watch next: Disentangle tariff effects from industrial bills like CHIPS; evaluate job costs, innovation outcomes, and retaliation patterns over decade.
