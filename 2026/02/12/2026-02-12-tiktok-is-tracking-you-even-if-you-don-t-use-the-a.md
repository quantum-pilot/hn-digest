# TikTok is tracking you, even if you don't use the app

### TL;DR
TikTok’s updated tracking pixel lets it collect data about you on other websites—including health, fertility, and mental-health pages—even if you’ve never used TikTok. It can also piggyback on data sites already send to Google, giving TikTok unusually deep visibility into your activity. The article shows how this fits the broader surveillance-advertising model and suggests defenses: privacy-focused browsers, tracker-blocking extensions, and TikTok opt‑outs. Commenters stress that this isn’t unique to TikTok but symptomatic of today’s adtech ecosystem.

### Comment pulse
- TikTok isn’t special → this is the same cross-site tracking Google, Meta, and others have done for years—counterpoint: article claims TikTok’s pixel is unusually grabby.  
- Corporate incentives misaligned → advertisers want attribution, sites want revenue, so users’ privacy loses unless they pay or aggressively self-defend.  
- PR language enrages people → “empower users” and “industry standard” are seen as doublespeak when non‑users can’t even know they’re being tracked.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat all major ad platforms—TikTok, Google, Meta—as one surveillance system; harden your browser rather than chase individual brands.  
- Impact: Privacy-conscious users will move to hardened stacks; average users stay exposed until defaults in Chrome/Safari meaningfully change.  
- Watch next: Browser-level tracker blocking by default, stronger health-data rules, and whether regulators tackle server-side tracking, not just pixels and cookies.
