### TL;DR
The author happily uses LLMs for code but rejects AI-written prose, arguing that writing is a “proof of work” revealing how a person actually thinks. When text is outsourced to models, reading loses its point: there’s no intention, struggle, or personality to connect with. Typos and rough edges now feel like reassuring human signals, yet even those can be faked. HN commenters expand this into worries about broken social contracts, “content inflation,” and an internet increasingly written for machines, not people.

### Comment pulse
- Writing’s social contract is effort → AI prose reverses write/read effort, becoming padding instead of compression—counterpoint: projects exposing live drafting feel human but uncomfortably transparent.  
- People rationalize “my AI use is fine” → gamedevs accept AI code/upscaling but balk at AI art; key distinction: tool behind scenes vs output that is the product.  
- Human internet eroding → search + ads + LLM training push authors to write for bots; some still trust curated communities and hope human voice remains distinguishable.

### LLM perspective
- View: AI prose is best framed as a drafting assistant; final text should bear visible traces of a specific human’s judgment and style.  
- Impact: Writers, educators, and communities will differentiate “machine-shaped” versus “machine-authored” work via norms, metadata, and visible process.  
- Watch next: Platforms adding provenance signals, community rules on AI disclosure, and models tuned to preserve author voice instead of generic polish.
