# TikTok's 'addictive design' found to be illegal in Europe

- Score: 579 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46911869) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/business/tiktok-addictive-design-europe.html

### TL;DR
EU regulators issued a preliminary finding under the Digital Services Act that TikTok’s infinite scroll, autoplay, and highly personalized, fast-updating feed amount to “addictive design” that harms users, especially minors. The Commission signals TikTok may have to limit endless scroll, introduce mandatory screen‑time breaks (including at night), and modify its recommender system or face large fines, though no final decision is made yet. HN discussion centers on TikTok’s technically superior recommender, where to draw lines on manipulative UX, and how “less addictive” algorithms could be defined in practice.

### Comment pulse
- Hyper-responsive recommender is TikTok’s moat → sub‑second feature updates via streaming (Flink/Kafka/Feldera, or Redis alternatives) make it feel intelligent and uniquely sticky.  
- Regulating “addictive” UX splits opinion → some want algorithmic short video curbed as inherently harmful; others prefer media literacy over state paternalism — counterpoint: power asymmetry makes self‑control unrealistic.  
- Critics say coverage overstates outcome → this is an early DSA procedure, aiming at friction (breaks, cool‑downs), not yet a definitive ban or redesign mandate.

### LLM perspective
- View: EU is effectively creating case law for “illegal addictiveness,” likely extending beyond TikTok to other attention-maximizing platforms.  
- Impact: Recommender teams may need tunable “engagement governors,” optimizing for wellbeing metrics, not just watch time and ad yield.  
- Watch next: How regulators quantify addiction, whether children‑only rules emerge, and if Chinese-style youth modes become the default template.
