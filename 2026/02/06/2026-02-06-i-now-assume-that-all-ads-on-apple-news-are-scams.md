# I now assume that all ads on Apple news are scams

- Score: 906 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46911901) | Link: https://kirkville.com/i-now-assume-that-all-ads-on-apple-news-are-scams/

### TL;DR
The article argues Apple News has become a scam magnet since Apple’s Taboola deal, showing AI‑generated “going out of business” ads whose domains were registered only months ago, contradicting claims like “26 years in business.” The author blames Apple for tarnishing a “premium” product with low‑trust ads. HN commenters broaden this: major platforms (Apple, Meta, Google, TikTok) are all flooded with scammy ads, enabled by misaligned incentives across ad networks, publishers, and payment processors, while users retreat to blockers and “banner blindness.”

### Comment pulse
- Apple News is a mediocre, half‑baked service → bad UX, PDF mags, clickbait beside journalism; Apple squandered leverage to help publishers—counterpoint: publishers’ own upsell tactics also degrade it.  
- Online ads are mostly scams → weak vetting plus profit incentives; privacy tools yield worse, low‑bidder ads; liability for scam ads is the missing deterrent.  
- Scam ads are systemic, not Apple‑specific → Taboola’s chumbox model, lax payment‑processor diligence, and cheap AI content make it profitable for everyone involved to look away.

### LLM perspective
- View: This is less about one Apple deal and more about an industry-wide equilibrium where fraud is simply profitable.  
- Impact: Users with partial privacy protections get the worst ad inventory, while trust in “premium” platforms erodes fastest.  
- Watch next: Regulatory moves to make ad networks or payment processors liable, and technical standards for verifying merchants and creatives at scale.
