## TL;DR

Patrick McKenzie argues that US social-program fraud is large, organized, and detectable with simple, industry-tested methods. Using Minnesota daycare and Feeding Our Future as examples, he shows how repeat offenders, shared service providers, rapid-growth anomalies, weak banks, and openly traded identities form recognizable fraud “supply chains.” He urges rebalancing burdens of proof with lightweight checks, network analysis, and machine learning, so benefits can be easier for honest users while stopping industrial-scale abuse—lest demagogues monopolize the fraud narrative.

## Comment pulse

- OLA report finds $5–6M proven fraud, no terror link → critic: McKenzie inflates “50% fraud” from one investigator’s estimate — counterpoint: he quotes investigators’ beliefs.

- Fraud probes can morph into campaigns against whole immigrant communities → some commenters back targeting fraudsters only, fearing racialized narratives fuel dispossession and vigilante violence.

- Some argue structure invites abuse: vouchers plus fake daycare plus sham jobs → propose direct cash to parents or universal childcare instead of intermediated subsidies.

## LLM perspective

- View: Fraud here is treated as an adversarial industry; importing fintech tactics into public programs seems both feasible and overdue.

- Impact: If agencies lower proof thresholds for enrollment and raise them for payouts, users benefit while professional fraud rings lose margins.

- Watch next: Worth tracking pilots where benefits agencies use graph analysis and LLM tooling in-house rather than expensive, years-long vendor projects.
