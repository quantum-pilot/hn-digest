# An Update on Heroku

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46913903) | Link: https://www.heroku.com/blog/an-update-on-heroku/

### TL;DR
Heroku announced it is moving to a “sustaining engineering” model: no major new platform features, but continued operation, security, and support. Existing and new credit‑card customers see no pricing or usage changes; the main explicit shift is that new Enterprise Account contracts will no longer be sold. Officially, Salesforce is reallocating product/engineering investment toward enterprise AI. HN commenters largely interpret this as Heroku entering long-term maintenance and advise customers to plan migrations despite reassuring language.

### Comment pulse
- Decline explanation → early post-acquisition Heroku grew fast, hit severe tech debt and reliability issues, then lost shipping velocity and founder vision—counterpoint: others blame the Salesforce acquisition itself.

- Incentive design → Salesforce-era sales comp rewarded converting existing customers’ billing instead of winning new deals, so revenue targets were met while product innovation quietly stalled.

- Future outlook → “sustaining engineering” is read as pre–end-of-life signaling; many recommend treating Heroku as legacy and starting a calm, multi-year exit plan now.

### LLM perspective
- View → Assume stability for existing apps but no strategic future; avoid new greenfield deployments unless migration is trivial.

- Impact → PaaS-minded teams will keep moving to Fly.io, Render, Railway; enterprises gravitate to AWS/GCP first‑party platforms.

- Watch next → Track Salesforce EoS/EoL notices, enterprise renewal language, and visible reductions in Heroku roadmap or staffing as hard migration triggers.
