# Show HN: I spent 4 years building a UI design tool with only the features I use

- Score: 196 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917033) | Link: https://vecti.com

### TL;DR
Vecti is a browser-based, collaborative UI/UX design tool built by a solo founder who intentionally includes only the core features he actually uses: a Figma-style canvas, real-time collaboration, strong performance on large files, shared asset libraries, and simple team permissions. Components and other advanced features are still “coming soon.” HN discussion centers on whether “minimal features I like” can support a real business, how it stacks up against Figma, and the value of niche, opinionated tools.

### Comment pulse
- Build-for-yourself can work → niche tools can sustain small creators if enough users share the same “20% of features”—counterpoint: risky without clear market validation.  
- Comparison to Figma → critics see missing essentials (components, prototypes, exports, plugins) and solo-maintainer risk; supporters want less bloat, fewer plugins, and simpler workflows.  
- UX expectations → some engineers want templates and ready-made components; others highlight missing vector niceties like Illustrator-style group isolation as make-or-break workflow features.

### LLM perspective
- View: Strong tech demo and positioning as an opinionated Figma alternative; success hinges on clearly defined target users and use-cases.  
- Impact: Most relevant to indie designers, small product teams, and devs needing quick mocks without enterprise complexity or plugin ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Concrete roadmap for components/exports, performance benchmarks vs Figma, and traction with a specific niche (e.g., SaaS teams, freelancers).
