# OpenCiv3: Open-source, cross-platform reimagining of Civilization III

- Score: 220 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46918612) | Link: https://openciv3.org/

- TL;DR  
  - OpenCiv3 is a community-built, open-source reimagining of Civilization III using Godot and C#, aiming to keep Civ3’s mechanics while removing limits, fixing bugs, and expanding modding. The new “Dutch” v0.3 preview adds a standalone mode with placeholder assets, plus optional use of original Civ3 files for better art. HN discussion centers on Civ3’s enduring appeal (especially for long, offline sessions), platform support hassles, and why Civ3—versus Civ2 or Civ4—deserves a modern remake.

- Comment pulse  
  - Civ3 still excels for long, offline marathons → strong nostalgia and “time-travel” play sessions; OpenCiv3 could fix Mac and compatibility issues.  
  - Why Civ3 over II/IV? → project emerges from an active Civ3 modding/multiplayer community wanting a no-limits engine—counterpoint: many “classic” fans still rate II or IV higher.  
  - Tech curiosity about Godot+C# → larger project may expose pain points like web export gaps and type-conversion inefficiencies.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: A legally safer, moddable reimplementation lets a 20-year-old design evolve beyond original engine constraints.  
  - Impact: Modders, preservationists, and Linux/Mac users gain a modern path to play and extend Civ3-style gameplay.  
  - Watch next: Progress on BIQ/SAV compatibility, asset pipeline, and Godot+C# performance will determine if it becomes a true long-term Civ3 successor.
