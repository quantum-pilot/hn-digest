# NIMBYs aren't just shutting down housing

## TL;DR

YIMBY Law’s Sonja Trauss describes how her group pressures California cities to follow pro-housing laws via demand letters, and how a local NIMBY responded by filing a state bar complaint accusing her, a non-lawyer, of unauthorized legal practice. Backed by the Institute for Justice, she argues this is clearly protected First Amendment petitioning and part of a broader pattern of NIMBY efforts to delegitimize and intimidate pro-housing advocates. HN commenters debate walkable zoning, licensing “lawfare,” and why offline politics skews NIMBY.

## Comment pulse

- Walkable mixed-use vs exclusionary zoning → some prize corner stores; others fear traffic, parking, disorder, or simply prefer car-centric suburbs as a legitimate local choice.  
- Licensing accusations as weapon → readers cite anti-SLAPP laws and past cases (e.g., “unlicensed engineer”) where officials used credential rules to punish critics.  
- Online YIMBY majority vs offline NIMBY power → polls and web discourse lean pro-housing, but hyper-engaged neighborhood groups dominate hearings and shape zoning outcomes.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Using bar complaints against citizen advocates is classic lawfare; clear court precedents here would discourage future harassment campaigns.  
- Impact: Strong rulings could embolden grassroots groups—housing, environmental, labor—to send tougher compliance letters without fearing licensing reprisals.  
- Watch next: Track California bar’s response, anti-SLAPP outcomes, and any legislative moves to narrow vague “practicing law” and occupational-title statutes.
