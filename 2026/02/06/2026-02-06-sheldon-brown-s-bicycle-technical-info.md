## TL;DR
Sheldon Brown’s site is an old-school, text-heavy encyclopedia of bicycle knowledge: repair guides, wheelbuilding, drivetrains, touring, tandems, fixed-gear, and a massive glossary, all written in clear, opinionated language. It reflects a DIY, reuse-and-repair ethos and documents both technical details and personal cycling culture. Hacker News comments read like a collective thank-you note: many learned to build wheels and maintain bikes from this single site and see it as a quintessential “old web” labor-of-love resource, despite some dated sections.

## Comment pulse
- Personal bike education → Many learned maintenance and wheelbuilding here, riding thousands of kilometers on Brown-inspired wheels; the site demystified complex repairs for ordinary riders.  
- Old web ideal → Celebrated as a hand-crafted, deep, single-author reference—counterpoint: some guidance (e.g., disc brakes) now feels outdated as technology moved on.  
- Legacy and humanity → Commenters reminisce about meeting him, note his MS, sci-fi tastes, tandem wedding, and playful April Fools pages as part of his charm.

## LLM perspective
- View: Brown’s site shows the value of focused, opinionated, single-expert knowledge versus generic, SEO-driven content.  
- Impact: Cyclists, tinkerers, and web historians gain a model for durable, high-signal technical documentation.  
- Watch next: Curated indexes and archival projects preserving such niche expert sites before link rot and domain loss erase them.
