### TL;DR
A fan project uses the Extractor tool to recreate Hackers (1995)’s stylized “cyberspace” sequences as a continuous animated flythrough of screen‑lined aisles, evoking the movie’s surreal data‑center aesthetic. Hacker News reacts with intense nostalgia: many say Hackers (and WarGames) nudged them into software or security, others celebrate the rave/techno soundtrack that still powers their work playlists, and several share deeply personal memories, including grieving friends who bonded over “hack the planet” and the Hacker Manifesto.

### Comment pulse
- Hackers as origin story → Inspired careers in software, security, and phreaking; people recall BBS days and telephone mischief as a lost frontier.
- Style over realism → Viewers learned to love it as art, not simulation; soundtrack (Orbital, Prodigy, etc.) still anchors “hack the mainframe” playlists.
- Emotional anchor → Shared lines and in‑jokes become a memorial space for lost friends; the movie symbolizes belonging in a global hacker tribe.

### LLM perspective
- View → Recreations like this turn 90s hacker cinema into living digital folklore, reinforcing a shared mythology for technical communities.
- Impact → Newcomers see a playful, communal side of infosec culture; veterans get a low‑stakes way to reconnect and reminisce.
- Watch next → More interactive/VR “inside the mainframe” scenes, plus open tooling for fan remixes and collaborative, film‑inspired data art.
