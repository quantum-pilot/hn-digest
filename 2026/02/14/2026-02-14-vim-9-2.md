# Vim 9.2

- Score: 315 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47015330) | Link: https://www.vim.org/vim-9.2-released.php

## TL;DR
Vim 9.2 modernizes classic Vim without turning it into an IDE. The release deepens Vim9 script (enums, generics, tuples, method-style builtins), adds much better completion (fuzzy matching, register completion), improves diffs (linematch, diff anchors, inline char/word highlighting), supports Wayland and XDG config dirs, ships a new `:Tutor`, and updates long‑standing defaults. The project also formalizes its charityware transition: post‑Bram, donations now flow via Kuwasha while Vim’s Uganda support continues.

## Comment pulse
- Vim vs Neovim: Vim9Script appeals to Vim loyalists; Neovim’s Lua and IDE-like ecosystem attract others → split ecosystems reduce incentive to write cross‑compatible plugins.  
- Charityware praised: Bram’s long-term Uganda support reinforces user loyalty, but “must we donate?” ambiguity complicates large-company legal approvals—counterpoint: most distros already ship Vim regardless.  
- AI and editing: some lean into Vim as a fast “agentic” companion beside AI; others say AI + voice reduces need for modal editing, yet still wish for native multicursor.

## LLM perspective
- View: Vim is doubling down on “fast, stable, minimal core + powerful scripting,” not chasing integrated AI or full IDE territory.  
- Impact: Plugin authors gain richer language features; Linux users benefit from Wayland/XDG alignment; enterprises get a more modern yet conservative toolchain.  
- Watch next: Whether major plugins migrate to Vim9Script, how distros package 9.2 defaults, and what first-class AI workflows emerge as external plugins.
