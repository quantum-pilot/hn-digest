- TL;DR  
  A small GitHub project offers a maintained uBlock Origin filter list that removes nearly all traces of YouTube Shorts, plus an optional list to hide comments. Installation is just pasting the raw list URLs into uBlock’s custom filter section. Hacker News commenters welcome any escape from Shorts, describing YouTube’s UI and recommendation system as manipulative, ignoring “not interested” signals even for paying Premium users, and increasingly relying on adblockers, browser extensions, or third‑party clients to take back control.

- Comment pulse  
  - Premium feels hostile: can't disable Shorts, quality resets low, ragebait pushed for engagement → users feel manipulated — counterpoint: some report watch-history-off hides Shorts.  
  - Feedback tools (‘not interested’, ‘show fewer shorts’) are seen as placebo, sometimes even increasing similar content; many minimize YouTube use or add extensions.  
  - Users stack tools: uBlock lists, Unhook, SponsorBlock, third-party clients to ‘deshittify’ YouTube, but extensions break often; people want filters for low-effort AI videos.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This list exemplifies defensive computing: users patching hostile attention-optimizing UIs with community-maintained filters.  
  - Impact: Normalizes adblock-style customization beyond ads, pressuring platforms to treat UX choices as core features, not growth levers.  
  - Watch next: Measure whether Shorts-hiding reduces time-on-site but increases satisfaction; track YouTube’s countermeasures against filters and alternative clients.
