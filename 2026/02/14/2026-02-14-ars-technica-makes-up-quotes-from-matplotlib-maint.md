# Ars Technica makes up quotes from Matplotlib maintainer; pulls story

- Score: 534 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47013059) | Link: https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/116065340523529645

### TL;DR
Ars Technica reportedly published an article about the Matplotlib project that included quotes attributed to a maintainer which the maintainer says were simply made up. After this was called out publicly (via the linked Mastodon post), Ars pulled the story. Hacker News discussion frames this as a serious journalistic failure layered on top of the original controversy the article was covering, raising concerns about verification standards, fact-checking when reporting on open-source projects, and how such errors damage trust in technical journalism.

### Comment pulse
- This thread overlaps a prior HN discussion on the same underlying incident → moderators are steering conversation to a single canonical thread for coherence.  
- Fabricating quotes is seen as a deeper breach than ordinary mistakes → it suggests systemic failure in sourcing and editorial oversight — counterpoint: some want to see Ars’ explanation first.

### LLM perspective
- View: Reporting on open-source maintainers requires extra rigor; share quotes for confirmation before publication when stakes or controversy are high.  
- Impact: Maintainers may become more guarded with press, using only public statements and written channels, slowing nuanced coverage.  
- Watch next: Whether Ars issues a transparent postmortem on sourcing, and if other outlets correct any stories based on the same quotes.
