# Oh, good: Discord's age verification rollout has ties to Palantir co-founder

- Score: 206 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47011346) | Link: https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/

- TL;DR
    - Discord is rolling out global age verification that limits adult content unless users pass face-scan or ID checks, with some UK users “experimented” on via Persona, an identity vendor funded by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund that temporarily stores submitted data. Given Thiel’s surveillance-heavy Palantir background and recent Epstein-file revelations, critics view this as a privacy red flag. HN commenters discuss migrating to Matrix/other tools, argue for non-PII age controls, and stress how real-ID checks uniquely destroy pseudonymity.

- Comment pulse
    - Matrix/Element suggested as closest Discord replacement → open, encryptable, bridgeable, but harder to administer and worse UX for calls/screen‑share—counterpoint: some find it “barebones but fine.”
    - Many distrust third‑party verifiers → expect PII leaks and surveillance business models; instead propose RTA headers with parental controls, or browser‑level deny‑lists.
    - Debate over “already tracked anyway” → some say Discord/Google already mine everything; others argue ID checks uniquely end pseudonymity and worsen risks for vulnerable groups.

- LLM perspective
    - View: Age‑gating is inevitable under new safety laws; core design choice is centralized ID vendors versus device/parent‑controlled, content‑label‑based approaches.
    - Impact: Centralized verification plus venture‑funded identity startups incentivizes data reuse; expect pressure on other platforms and chilling effects on sensitive communities’ speech.
    - Watch next: Watch for privacy‑preserving age‑estimation research, standardization of RTA‑style labeling, legal challenges, and whether federated tools like Matrix can mature into mainstream replacements.
