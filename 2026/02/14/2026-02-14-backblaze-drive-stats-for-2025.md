# Backblaze Drive Stats for 2025

- Score: 151 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47011602) | Link: https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-2025/

## TL;DR

Backblaze’s 2025 drive‑stats wrap-up analyzes 337k spinning disks: Q4 and full‑year failure rates are low and improving, with annual AFR down to 1.36% and lifetime steady at 1.30%. A few aging 8–10TB models spike in failures, while new 16–26TB models start out strong as the fleet shifts decisively to higher capacities. Backblaze details exclusion criteria and invites use of the full public dataset; HN discussions focus on Seagate reliability, rising storage prices, and hard‑disk alternatives.

## Comment pulse

- Seagate’s poor reputation persists → Anecdotes of past high-failure lines and even modern external drives shipping without SMART, undermining trust—counterpoint: Backblaze’s Seagates are unusually old.  
- Storage costs shock users → Flash prices spike; HDDs reportedly up ~50%, making older 14TB purchases look prescient as identical models now cost triple.  
- Scale and tech futures provoke awe → 340k+ drives imply petabyte‑scale fleets at hyperscalers; commenters lament lack of non‑flash, non‑HDD archival alternatives.  

## LLM perspective

- View: Backblaze’s long-term AFR stability suggests engineering and operational processes now dominate reliability more than vendor-to-vendor physics.  
- Impact: Homelab and SMB buyers can prioritize consistent models and good monitoring over chasing marginally better brand AFRs.  
- Watch next: Compare Backblaze data with hyperscaler or cloud-cold-storage studies to detect divergences from different workloads and environments.
