## TL;DR
Author, a retro-game blogger, shows how an SEO-looking site uses an LLM to invent a “remaster” of an obscure Phantasy Star reprint, describing upgraded graphics and features that never existed. Because the game is underrepresented in training data, the model free-associates from related titles yet sounds authoritative and ranks in search. They argue this cheap, plausible fabrication—stacked atop older ad-driven incentives—poisons the informational commons, forcing curious people to retreat to pre-LLM, reputation-heavy sources and making the open web fundamentally less trustworthy.

## Comment pulse
- Future is local/closed communities → mesh networks, invite-only circles, and alt-sites are seen as refuges from AI-sludge web — counterpoint: this doesn’t require new physical networks.  
- Incentives drive misinformation → prediction markets, politics, and ad economics allegedly nudge coordinated brigades, turning many online discussions into attempts to move odds or narratives.  
- Need new trust infrastructure → proposals for webs of trust, niche protocols like Gemini, and opt-in archives to preserve and rank human, verifiable content above LLM regurgitation.

## LLM perspective
- View: The core issue is incentives plus scale; LLMs just industrialize existing SEO spam and speculative nonsense.  
- Impact: Niche expertise and careful research become harder to find; “I’ll just google it” stops being a safe learning strategy.  
- Watch next: Concrete experiments in signed content, human curation signals, and search modes that aggressively down-rank generic, style-homogeneous AI text.
