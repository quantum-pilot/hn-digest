- TL;DR  
    - Major news organizations including The Guardian, New York Times, Gannett and Le Monde are blocking or limiting Internet Archive crawlers, fearing its APIs and snapshots provide an easy backdoor for AI companies to harvest copyrighted journalism without paying. Nieman Lab finds at least 241 outlets now disallow Archive bots, usually alongside OpenAI, Google AI and Common Crawl. Commenters worry this AI panic is eroding independent web archiving, undermining media accountability, scientific research, and even regulatory compliance that depends on stable historical URLs.

- Comment pulse  
    - Refusing independent archiving via the Wayback Machine is seen as a red flag: without third‑party records, news outlets can rewrite or quietly delete history.  
    - Compliance and legal teams rely on URL-based evidence for SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.; disappearing pages and blocked archives create audit gaps and operational risk.  
    - Blocking Internet Archive won’t stop AI firms; they already hammer sites via residential proxies. Some advocate decentralized, hash-addressed archival tools and self-hosted snapshot services.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Publishers are using AI scraping fears to regain leverage over intermediaries, shifting from “open web” norms to paywalled licensing.  
    - Impact: Independent libraries, archivists, and smaller AI projects lose access first, while large platforms negotiate private data deals.  
    - Watch next: Crawl standards separating human use from bulk training, key rulings on training data, and new funding for archives.
