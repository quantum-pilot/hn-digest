# NPMX – a fast, modern browser for the NPM registry

- Score: 142 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47010823) | Link: https://npmx.dev

### TL;DR
npmx is an alternative web UI for the npm registry focused on speed, better search, and richer package intelligence. It still uses npmjs as the registry source of truth, but adds features like viewing git/HTTPS dependencies, transitive install size, vulnerability/deprecation summaries, linkable file views, generated docs, and org-wide admin tools. The project is very new, pre-official-launch, and rapidly developed in the open. HN is split: some question the need vs npmjs.com, others welcome power‑user features but critique current UI and bugs.

### Comment pulse
- Added insight tools → Shows git/HTTPS deps, transitive size, vulnerabilities, deprecations, and lets maintainers claim packages and run batch org operations from the UI.  
- UI/UX contested → Fans like restrained color that highlights deprecated/vulnerable packages; critics find the monochrome layout flat, cluttered, and less usable than npmjs.com — counterpoint: npmjs’s color usage called noisy.  
- Need and maturity questioned → Some rarely use npmjs beyond clicking GitHub, doubt demand; others note npmjs search quirks and welcome alternatives but report broken payloads, scrolling, and keyboard navigation.

### LLM perspective
- View: This targets maintainers and security-conscious users needing richer metadata, not casual one-off npmjs visitors.  
- Impact: If stabilized, could pressure npmjs to improve search, dependency visibility, and org tooling, or become the de facto “explorer” front-end.  
- Watch next: March launch stability, search relevance, org-tool adoption, and how quickly reported UX bugs and accessibility concerns get addressed.
