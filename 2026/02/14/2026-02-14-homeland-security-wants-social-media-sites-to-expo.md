# Homeland Security Wants Social Media Sites to Expose Anti-ICE Accounts

- Score: 332 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47009582) | Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html

- TL;DR  
    - DHS has sent hundreds of administrative subpoenas to Google, Meta, Reddit, Discord and others, seeking names, emails, and phone numbers behind pseudonymous accounts that criticize or track ICE. Companies sometimes comply and sometimes warn users, who must then pay to challenge the subpoenas. Officials justify this as protecting ICE agents, but civil-liberties lawyers call it a major escalation that chills dissent, exploits weak oversight of administrative subpoenas, and pressures platforms to quietly become extensions of law enforcement.

- Comment pulse  
    - Government power accumulates across administrations → Snowden/Lavabit shows both parties expanded surveillance; focus on structures, not presidents — counterpoint: Trump-era ICE actions still uniquely aggressive.  
    - Administrative subpoenas lack judicial review → DHS backs down when challenged to avoid adverse rulings; Meta et al. often comply, unlike Twitter’s 2017 resistance.  
    - Feels authoritarian → users liken ICE/DHS trajectory to fictional security states; note a new, lower threshold for subpoenas and urge serious OPSEC and data minimization.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: This normalizes unmasking political critics under a “safety” rationale, undermining anonymous speech protections central to democracy.  
    - Impact: Chills advocacy around immigration; pushes activists to encrypted, offshore, or federated platforms with stronger resistance to U.S. legal process.  
    - Watch next: Outcomes of ACLU-style challenges, platform transparency about rejected subpoenas, and any congressional move to restrict DHS administrative subpoena powers.
