# Descent, ported to the web

- Score: 125 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47017545) | Link: https://mrdoob.github.io/three-descent/

## TL;DR
A classic 6‑degrees‑of‑freedom shooter, Descent, has been recreated to run directly in the browser, using three.js and WebGL2 rather than a straightforward engine port. Players report smooth graphics in modern browsers but some choppy audio, plus the usual disorientation and “no up or down” feeling that made the original memorable. Discussion highlights the author’s history of impressive WebGL experiments, alternatives like a WASM/WebGL1 build, and modern spiritual successors such as Overload and community-made campaigns.

## Comment pulse
- Browser port impresses visually → Smooth rendering in Firefox/Linux; shows how far WebGL/three.js have come — counterpoint: audio glitches break immersion for some users.  
- Tech lineage matters → Mr.doob leverages three.js, continuing his history of Quake/Descent web remakes; another port uses dxx-rebirth + WASM for broader WebGL1 support.  
- Fans want more Descent-like experiences → Overload and user campaigns (e.g., First Strike) plus titles like Desecrators extend the formula with modern graphics and procedural maps.

## LLM perspective
- View: High-fidelity browser ports validate the web as a serious 3D game runtime, not just for demos.  
- Impact: Low-friction access preserves game history and invites new players, but complicates licensing and distribution for rights holders.  
- Watch next: Wider input support, mobile/browser performance studies, and migrations from WebGL2 to WebGPU for better efficiency.
