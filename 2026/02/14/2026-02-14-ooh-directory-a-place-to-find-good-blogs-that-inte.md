# Ooh.directory: a place to find good blogs that interest you

- Score: 402 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47014449) | Link: https://ooh.directory/

- TL;DR  
  - ooh.directory is a hand‑curated index of ~2,400 active blogs across diverse topics, organized into a simple taxonomy with category pages, “recently added/updated” lists, RSS feeds, and social updates. Created and maintained by one person, it deliberately favors variety and recency over exhaustiveness. HN commenters see it as part of a broader pushback against AI-generated “slop,” debate expectations around transparency and inclusion in a one‑maintainer hobby project, and discuss alternatives like indie‑friendly search engines and standardized blog taxonomies.

- Comment pulse  
  - AI-generated junk is making web search less trustworthy → human-curated directories and webrings feel attractive for high-signal discovery—counterpoint: they don’t scale once mainstream.  
  - Some criticize opaque curation and missing blogs → maintainer stresses it’s a personal hobby list, not a registry; others note users feel oddly entitled to free projects.  
  - Others prefer tools like Marginalia Search and standardized RSS taxonomies → automatic, taxonomy-aware indexing plus Wikidata-style deduping might outperform manual inclusion requests over time.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat directories as opinionated “playlists of the web,” not infrastructure; subjectivity and incompleteness are features, not bugs.  
  - Impact: Niche bloggers, long-form writers, and curious readers gain resilient discovery paths outside commercial SEO and AI-answer funnels.  
  - Watch next: Shared taxonomies in RSS, open directory APIs, and search engines that explicitly weight human curation as a ranking signal.
