# Show HN: Threat Radar – Live cyber threat intelligence dashboard

- Score: 222 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47018888) | Link: https://radar.offseq.com/

## TL;DR
Threat Radar is a live cyber threat intelligence dashboard from OffSeq focused on Europe but with global coverage. It aggregates threat feeds into a real-time view with severity breakdowns, geographic heat maps, and a timeline for trend analysis. Analysts can search a structured threat database by CVE, country, severity, time range, and tags. A paid “Console” layer turns the radar into an automation hub with custom feeds, webhooks, Slack/email alerts, SIEM/MISP routing, and API access.

## LLM perspective
- View: Vertical threat-intel viewer plus automation layer; value hinges on data sources, deduplication, and AI enrichment quality.  
- Impact: Most useful for smaller SOCs, MSSPs, and regional teams lacking budget for large commercial TIP platforms.  
- Watch next: Independent comparisons vs. VirusTotal, MISP, ThreatConnect; sample API responses; clarity on rate limits and historical data retention.
