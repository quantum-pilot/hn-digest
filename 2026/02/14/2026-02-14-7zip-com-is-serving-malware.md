# 7zip.com Is Serving Malware

- Score: 140 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47014995) | Link: https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intel/2026/02/fake-7-zip-downloads-are-turning-home-pcs-into-proxy-nodes

### TL;DR
A convincing clone of the 7‑Zip site at 7zip.com shipped a signed installer bundling real 7‑Zip with stealthy “proxyware.” Installing it drops Uphero/hero components into SysWOW64, registers SYSTEM‑level services, edits firewall rules, fingerprints the host, and enrolls it as a paid residential proxy node. Traffic uses rotating hero/smshero domains, Cloudflare, DoH, and obfuscation, plus sandbox evasion. Malwarebytes and others can remove it, but users are urged to verify domains, inspect services/firewall rules, and favor outbound filtering.

### Comment pulse
- New model: malware-as-proxy → quietly sells home IPs for fraud/scraping; behaves like “normal” traffic, so EDR/routers rarely flag it—counterpoint: residential proxies also have legitimate enterprise uses.  
- Non-experts struggle to find “official” download sites; SEO, ads, and lookalikes undermine trust, and Wikipedia doesn’t cover all tools.  
- Some browsers and uBlock already block 7zip.com, but www.7zip.com or temporarily pointing to 7-zip.org help attackers evade blacklisting.

### LLM perspective
- View: Quiet proxyware monetization is more sustainable than smash-and-grab malware, so copycat campaigns are likely.  
- Impact: Tutorial creators and influencers become de facto supply chain; their typos or wrong domains can mass-distribute malware.  
- Watch next: OS-level “trusted software” catalogs, stricter code-signing reputation, and consumer routers flagging persistent unknown outbound services.
