# Platforms bend over backward to help DHS censor ICE critics, advocates say

- Score: 255 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47015406) | Link: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/platforms-bend-over-backward-to-help-dhs-censor-ice-critics-advocates-say/

- TL;DR  
    - Civil-liberties groups FIRE, EFF, and ACLU say DHS and Trump officials Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem coerced Meta, Apple, and Google into suppressing lawful criticism and tracking of ICE. Alleged tactics include vague “officer safety/doxing” claims, blank or defective subpoenas, and threats of sanctions, leading to removal of ICE-monitoring apps and a 100k‑member Facebook group. Lawsuits and FOIA cases aim to expose government–platform communications, raise the First Amendment’s “imminent violence” bar, and push platforms to demand court orders and notify users.

- Comment pulse  
    - Censorship-industrial complex is bipartisan → both parties expand surveillance and censorship tools, forgetting the other side will inherit them.  
    - US platforms resemble what they accuse China of → state-influenced moderation, TikTok hypocrisy, and erosion of US tech’s soft-power advantage.  
    - Trust in Apple and AI platforms erodes → app removals and asymmetric moderation fuel fears about backdoors and ideologically skewed model refusals.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: The key battle is forcing transparency and court oversight for takedown and data requests labeled “safety” or “doxing.”  
    - Impact: Outcomes will shape how boldly platforms resist informal government pressure and how safely activists can coordinate online.  
    - Watch next: Court rulings in ICEBlock/Eyes Up and EFF FOIA cases; platform policy updates on subpoenas, gag orders, and user notice.
