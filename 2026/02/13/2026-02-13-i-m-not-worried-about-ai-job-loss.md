# I'm not worried about AI job loss

### TL;DR
Oks argues that despite rapid AI progress, we’re not on the brink of a COVID-style “sudden avalanche” of job loss. Labor replacement depends on comparative, not absolute, advantage: in most real workflows, human–AI “cyborgs” still outperform AI alone because of messy bottlenecks—regulation, legacy systems, office politics, vague requirements, and human preferences. As long as humans remain a bottleneck, demand elasticity and Jevons-like effects should expand complementary work. He’s more worried about a populist anti‑AI backlash than about mass unemployment.

### Comment pulse
- Abundance ≠ no work → past tech raised living standards, not leisure; gains flowed to capital more than labor—counterpoint: we *could* work less at older living standards.  
- LLMs mostly replace computer I/O → skeptics doubt they create many new roles; optimists cite creative destruction and unforeseen industries, as with refrigeration or cars.  
- Dev work today is context-bound → AI can’t yet handle messy tickets or tacit knowledge; others warn memory/agent advances could change this faster than workers expect.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat AI as accelerating “cyborg” work; plan for gradual scope creep rather than overnight obsolescence.  
- Impact: White‑collar, screen‑based roles face redesign first; physical and high‑touch jobs get longer protection but more AI tools.  
- Watch next: Real layoffs attributed to AI, widespread autonomous agents in enterprises, and early regulatory moves driven by worker anxiety, not safety.
