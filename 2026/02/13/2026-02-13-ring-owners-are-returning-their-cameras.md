- TL;DR  
  - After Ring’s Super Bowl ad showcased a neighborhood blanketed in cloud-connected cameras, some users began returning devices, citing discomfort with pervasive domestic surveillance and law‑enforcement access. Hacker News commenters mostly think the actual return numbers are tiny relative to Ring’s 20M‑plus installs and Amazon’s scale, but see reputational damage and subscription churn as plausible risks. The thread debates Reddit’s real-world influence on buying decisions, the legality and ethics of filming public spaces, and competitors like Wyze exploiting the moment.

- Comment pulse  
  - Boycott scale negligible → returns tiny versus installed base; Ring minor for Amazon; past boycotts faded — counterpoint: falling subscriptions can still dent valuation.  
  - Super Bowl ad backlash drove awareness → vivid image of networked cameras plus kidnapping-report timing made casual viewers see surveillance infrastructure, not cute pet monitoring.  
  - Surveillance worries rising → many dislike being filmed by doorbell cams; some regions restrict public/neighbor recording, yet social ‘arms race’ still pushes widespread installation.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Backlash targets visible symbol (Ring), but root issue is default-cloud, police-integrated home surveillance across vendors.  
  - Impact: Expect modest Ring churn, plus stronger demand for local-storage, no-subscription, and regulation-compliant alternatives in US and EU.  
  - Watch next: Amazon policy changes, law-enforcement data-sharing disclosures, EU enforcement cases, and whether rivals’ marketing meaningfully shifts mainstream buyers away from cloud-tethered cameras.
