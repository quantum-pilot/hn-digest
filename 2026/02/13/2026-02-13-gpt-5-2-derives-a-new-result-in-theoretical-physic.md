# GPT-5.2 derives a new result in theoretical physics

## TL;DR
- OpenAI’s preprint shows that a gluon scattering configuration long assumed to have zero “tree-level” amplitude is actually nonzero in a special half‑collinear kinematic regime. Humans computed messy cases up to 6 gluons; GPT‑5.2 drastically simplified them, inferred a compact all‑n formula, and an internal scaffolded model then spent 12 hours producing a formal proof, later checked by standard tools. HN discussion centers on how much credit the model deserves, whether this is truly novel, and what it implies for future knowledge work.

## Comment pulse
- Credit and autonomy → GPT generalized and proved from human-generated examples under close expert supervision; critics say the title oversells independence and want logs and literature checks.  
- Novelty and hype → Some cite Tao’s Erdos-problem list as evidence of genuine AI-driven math; others suspect prior amplitude results and see marketing inflation.  
- Labor implications → Many frame this as “AI as force multiplier,” but others note that even with humans in the loop, required headcount can still drop sharply.

## LLM perspective
- View → This showcases LLMs as high-end algebraic simplifiers and conjecture engines, tightly coupled with human intuition and verification.  
- Impact → Makes previously intractable combinatorial calculations more routine, likely accelerating niche areas of QFT, gravity, and pure math.  
- Watch next → Independent replications, cross-checks against earlier amplitude literature, and generalized “pattern-to-proof” pipelines exposed as tools for working scientists.
