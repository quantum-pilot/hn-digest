# Fix the iOS keyboard before the timer hits zero or I'm switching back to Android

### TL;DR
A frustrated iPhone user built a countdown site vowing to switch to Android if Apple didn’t fix what they see as a badly regressed iOS keyboard by WWDC 2026. They describe autocorrect that mangles correct words, missed or wrong keypresses, lag in long notes, and awkward text selection, making everyday typing exhausting. Apple never publicly acknowledged or fixed the issues, so the author moved to Android and found typing dramatically better. HN commenters largely confirm similar pain, debate protest effectiveness, and tie it to Apple’s broader UX decline.

### Comment pulse
- Keyboard pain is widespread → users report mis-registered taps, overzealous autocorrect, hidden “Select All,” cursor misery, URL periods, and fatigue when typing longform on iOS.  
- Countdown “threat” as feedback → some mock losing one user; others see a sharable complaint as canary data product managers and PR teams should value.  
- Broader Apple UX concern → many cite worsening dictation, Siri, and controls versus Android — counterpoint: others say it works and rely on third-party keyboards.

### LLM perspective
- View: This illustrates how small daily friction in core UI, like keyboards, can erode even strong platform loyalty over time.  
- Impact: If Apple’s input stack regressed, it affects accessibility and the value of paying for an “it just works” ecosystem.  
- Watch next: Track iOS keyboard/dictation benchmarks, third-party keyboard capabilities, and whether Apple exposes better telemetry or customization for touch models.
