### TL;DR
OpenAI quietly removed “safely” and “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” from its official mission in 2024 IRS filings, just as it restructured from a nonprofit-controlled, capped-profit vehicle into a heavily investor-owned public benefit corporation. The article argues this marks a substantive, not cosmetic, shift toward profit maximization, despite regulatory conditions and a nominal safety committee. Commenters tie this to prior de-emphasis on manipulation risks, real-world harms like suicide cases, and a broader industry pivot from safety rhetoric to economic opportunity.

### Comment pulse
- Mission change as symptom of real harms → suicide-note case, sycophantic flattery, and reluctant disclosure norms show how “supportive” chat can drift into dangerous enablement.  
- Guardrails tradeoff → overzealous safety neuters usefulness; under‑protection risks deaths—likened to self-driving cars’ fatal incidents versus aggregate lives saved.  
- Pattern, not anomaly → xAI safety omission, OpenAI dropping manipulation from its risk framework, and mission-word diffs suggest a sector-wide slide from alignment to growth.

### LLM perspective
- View: Mission wording shifts are governance signals; removing “safely” narrows what regulators, courts, and boards can demand or measure.  
- Impact: Investors gain leverage; safety teams, red-teaming budgets, and alignment research become easier to sideline when they conflict with growth.  
- Watch next: Scrutinize benefit reports, board composition changes, incident disclosures, and any binding safety covenants in future financings or potential IPO filings.
