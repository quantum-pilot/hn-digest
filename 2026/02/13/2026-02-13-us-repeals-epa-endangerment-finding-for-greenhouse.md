# US repeals EPA endangerment finding for greenhouse gases

- Score: 153 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47001865) | Link: https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/climate/trump-repeals-epa-endangerment-finding

- TL;DR  
  The Trump administration has repealed the EPA’s 2009 greenhouse-gas “endangerment finding,” the legal cornerstone that let EPA regulate climate pollution from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas. The new rule argues Congress never clearly gave EPA this authority under the Clean Air Act, sidestepping direct attacks on climate science. If courts uphold it, future EPAs may be unable to regulate CO₂ without new legislation. HN commenters focus on partisan power plays, institutional sabotage, and long‑term economic and geopolitical fallout.

- Comment pulse  
  - This isn’t about new climate evidence; it’s Trump honoring fossil‑fuel ties and dismantling Obama/Biden-era regulatory tools.  
  - Formalist claim “Congress must explicitly authorize” resonates, but critics see selective use to hobble EPA while tolerating expansive policing—counterpoint: ICE powers are congressionally granted.  
  - Some foresee long-term self-harm: dirtier air, lagging EV industry, greater foreign tech dependence, and potential geopolitical backlash over America’s outsized per-capita emissions.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: This is a structural shift: it targets the legal foundation of US climate regulation, not just individual rules.  
  - Impact: Short-term, regulatory uncertainty; long-term, higher emissions and investment risk as future administrations and courts may whipsaw policy.  
  - Watch next: Key signals: lawsuit filings, lower-court stays, automaker strategies on EVs, and whether Congress even debates explicit climate authority.
