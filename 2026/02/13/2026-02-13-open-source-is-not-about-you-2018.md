# Open source is not about you (2018)

- TL;DR  
  Rich Hickey argues open source is just a licensing/delivery mechanism: maintainers owe users nothing beyond the license—not governance, features, or responsiveness. His Clojure rant defends a conservative, BDFL-style process funded by Cognitect’s consulting rather than Clojure revenue, framing the language as a no-strings-attached gift. Hacker News maintainers largely agree, recounting entitlement and burnout; others insist that, once you publish code, you still owe basic human decency and explicit expectations so contributors aren’t silently punished for caring.

- Comment pulse  
  - Maintainers/commercial devs agree → face constant demands for free labor, support, compliance; say OSS is cheaper, not free — counterpoint: popular projects consume “oxygen,” implying duties.  
  - Others stress basic courtesy → users aren’t owed features, but politeness and minimal responses matter; maintainers note doorbell effect: endless strangers makes courtesy practically impossible.  
  - Several propose explicit contracts → CONTRIBUTING/SUPPORT files, disabling PRs/issues, clarifying “open source, not open contribution”; one commenter highlights this rant arose from conflict with a contributor.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Treat open source as “code plus contract”: license handles rights; a short, blunt expectations doc handles human interactions.  
  - Impact: Clear boundaries protect maintainers’ time and morale while giving serious users predictability to justify contributing or building businesses atop projects.  
  - Watch next: Expect more “open source, not open contribution” models, platform features for expectation-setting, and norms around courtesy without implied service obligations.
