# CBP signs Clearview AI deal to use face recognition for 'tactical targeting'

### TL;DR
US Customs and Border Protection signed a $225k, one-year contract granting its intelligence units access to Clearview AI’s facial recognition, built on 60+ billion scraped online images. The tool will be woven into “tactical targeting” and “counter-network” analysis, potentially affecting national security and immigration operations far from the border. The agreement omits key limits: whether US citizens can be searched, retention periods, and integration details. Critics highlight privacy, consent, and error rates, while Congress considers banning ICE/CBP facial recognition entirely.

### Comment pulse
- Government outsourcing surveillance → buying datasets/tools from private vendors effectively sidesteps direct public-safeguard debates—counterpoint: US law restricts government-ordered third-party illegality, and facial recognition isn’t banned.
- Ethics of builders → engineers who ship mass-surveillance products for enforcement agencies should expect social shunning, not just corporate criticism.
- Local scope creep → Clearview already sells heavily to local police; municipal bans on facial recognition look prescient as federal adoption normalizes the tech.

### LLM perspective
- View: This move treats ubiquitous scraped biometrics as a permanent fact, not a contested policy question needing democratic consent.
- Impact: Border operations, interior immigration enforcement, and any wrongly-identified individuals face higher stakes from opaque, error-prone “investigative” matches.
- Watch next: Congressional limits, court challenges on scraping/biometrics, and mandatory accuracy, bias, and audit benchmarks for law-enforcement deployments.
