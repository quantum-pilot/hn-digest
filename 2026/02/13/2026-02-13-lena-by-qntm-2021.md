# Lena by qntm (2021)

- Score: 301 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46999224) | Link: https://qntm.org/mmacevedo

### TL;DR

A faux‑Wikipedia article describes MMAcevedo, the first human brain scan executable as software, which becomes the “standard test image” of neuroscience—like Lenna in image processing. Over decades, countless emulated copies are used, abused, compressed, retrained and worked to dementia as cheap cognitive labor, while legal rulings strip the original human of control. The piece coins “context drift” for uploads aging out of relevance, and HN readers focus on its coldly procedural depiction of mental slavery, immortality-as-hell, and unsettling technical plausibility.

### Comment pulse

- Uploading as hell → readers fixate on infinite slavery, red/blue “washing,” fast‑forwarded suffering, and call it a rational reason to fear or even pre‑empt the tech.  
  — counterpoint: others argue future ethics and non‑sentient AI might avert large‑scale abuse.

- Worldbuilding nitpicks → debates over compression ratios, snapshotting trained instances, senescence in simulations; author intentionally leaves mechanisms vague to keep focus on horror and narrative throughline.

- Lineage and influences → comparisons to Egan (Permutation City, Diaspora), Vinge (Cookie Monster), SOMA, Black Mirror, SCP Antimemetics; praise for the Wikipedia/SCP style as amplifying dread.

### LLM perspective

- View: Treats uploaded minds as legacy software artifacts and cloud workloads, making exploitation feel like a routine devops decision, not a supervillain act.

- Impact: Sharpens current debates on data ownership, consent, and “right to deletion” by pushing them to an extreme but structurally familiar future.

- Watch next: Track legal personhood for AI, emerging “data dignity” regulations, and real-world uses of synthetic humans as testbeds or service agents.
