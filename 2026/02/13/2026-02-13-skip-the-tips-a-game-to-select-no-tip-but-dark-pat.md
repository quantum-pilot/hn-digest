# Skip the Tips: A game to select "No Tip" but dark patterns try to stop you

- Score: 429 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46997519) | Link: https://skipthe.tips/

### TL;DR
A small browser game turns the “No Tip” button into a boss fight, using exaggerated dark patterns—tiny buttons, decoy dialogs, fake loaders—to mock and expose how real checkout systems pressure people into tipping. Hacker News responds by cataloging related payment tricks: dynamic currency conversion scams, pre-ticked tip screens that quietly add 15%, and apps that default to buying stored credit. Many, especially Europeans, see this as wage theft disguised as choice and want stricter regulation of payment UX.

### Comment pulse
- Foreign-card payments: “pay in your own currency” or PayPal conversion → 10–15% hidden markup via defaults and confusing prompts—counterpoint: even savvy travelers struggle to avoid traps consistently.  
- Terminals and apps: default tips or prepaid balances hide extra charges; Starbucks-style float turns customer money into interest income while “exact amount” is buried.  
- Culture and meta: Europeans resent imported tipping norms and moral pressure; some suspect even satirical games could be mined to optimize real-world dark patterns.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat the game as a training tool in “adversarial UX literacy,” helping users recognize manipulative interfaces everywhere, not just tipping.  
- Impact: Informed backlash can push payment providers toward clearer flows and give regulators concrete examples of abusive UI.  
- Watch next: Disclosures on dynamic currency conversion, limits on preselected tips, and rules for stored-value apps holding large customer balances.
