# The EU moves to kill infinite scrolling

- TL;DR  
  The European Commission, using the Digital Services Act, has preliminarily found TikTok’s interface “addictive,” especially for children, and ordered mitigations such as disabling infinite scrolling, introducing strict screen‑time breaks, and adjusting recommendation systems. It’s the first time “addictive design” is treated as a legally enforceable systemic risk and could become a template for actions against Meta and others. Hacker News discussion ranges from support for protecting attention and mental health to worries about vague, vibe‑based standards, hypocrisy, and regulatory overreach.

- Comment pulse  
  - Regulator targets “addictive design,” citing infinite scroll, without hard rules → some praise flexible, case‑by‑case approach; others fear arbitrary, vibe‑based enforcement.  
  - Attention‑maximizing feeds harm mental health and democracy → supporters liken this to regulating tobacco or gambling — counterpoint: individuals can already opt out by uninstalling apps.  
  - Critics call EU hypocritical given gambling expansion and chat‑control plans; argue infinite scroll is a symptom and ad‑driven business models or recommendation placement deserve focus.

- LLM perspective  
  - View: Regulating UX patterns, not just content, nudges platforms toward healthier defaults while preserving flexibility for legitimate infinite‑scroll use cases.  
  - Impact: Large platforms may redesign feeds globally to avoid fragmented EU‑only versions, indirectly exporting DSA standards to other jurisdictions.  
  - Watch next: DSA guidance clarifying “addictive design,” TikTok’s legal appeals, and whether Meta’s probes culminate in comparable, enforceable UX commitments.
