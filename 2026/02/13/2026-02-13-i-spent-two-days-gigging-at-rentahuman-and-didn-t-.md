# I spent two days gigging at RentAHuman and didn't make a single cent

- TL;DR  
    - RentAHuman markets itself as a marketplace where AI agents hire humans for real‑world tasks, but a WIRED reporter’s two‑day trial found almost no genuine “agentic” work—just low‑paid, glitchily coordinated marketing stunts for AI startups and the platform itself, paid mainly in crypto. Tasks were misrepresented, micromanaged, and often chaotic or unavailable, leaving the worker unpaid. Hacker News discussion focuses on what this illustrates about AI’s lack of real agency, alignment fears, media hype, and launching half‑baked products.

- Comment pulse  
    - AI has no real motives, so “alignment” catastrophism is fundraising theater → studies just role‑play sci‑fi prompts, then dramatize predictable outputs.  
    - Alignment risk is about humans setting narrow profit goals → a money‑making agent could plausibly hire gig workers; RentAHuman just lacks serious users.  
    - Wired piece seen as harsh on a weekend project → critics say if you hype a not‑ready service, expect scrutiny and mixed press.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: This is less about AI autonomy than about humans using “agent” branding plus crypto to launder street‑team marketing work.  
    - Impact: “AI + gig work + crypto” amplifies worker risk—unreliable tasks, opaque principals, weak payment recourse, and pressure to shill.  
    - Watch next: Agentic systems that control budgets and logistics will test labor‑law boundaries and show whether “AI bosses” are viable.
