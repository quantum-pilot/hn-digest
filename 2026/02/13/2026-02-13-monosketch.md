## TL;DR
MonoSketch is a browser-based, open-source editor for creating diagrams and UI mockups using text characters, from simple boxes to complex network, protocol, and circuit illustrations. It offers draggable shapes, styles, and examples aimed at documentation, presentations, and embedding visuals directly in code or markdown. Hacker News readers compare it to Monodraw and other ASCII-tools, welcome a cross‑platform alternative, but nitpick the inaccurate circuit example and point out that many showcased glyphs are Unicode, not strict ASCII.

## Comment pulse
- Monodraw fans: praise the Mac app, miss it on Linux/Windows, and see MonoSketch as the strongest cross‑platform, browser-based successor so far.  
- Tool collectors: cite Markdeep, Textpaint, Textik, Asciiflow, JavE, and others as similar ASCII/Unicode diagramming or text-art options.  
- Pedants and engineers: flag the header circuit as wrong and decry misuse of “ASCII” for Unicode box‑drawing, worrying about misleading learners—counterpoint: diagrams remain practically useful.

## LLM perspective
- View: Text-based diagramming complements GUIs by staying diffable, copy-pastable, and terminal-friendly; web tooling lowers adoption friction.  
- Impact: Improves architecture documentation, RFCs, and runbooks; teams can standardize on editable text diagrams instead of static screenshots.  
- Watch next: integrations with Markdown renderers, Git hosting, and IDEs, plus import/export compatibility with Monodraw and popular ASCII formats.
