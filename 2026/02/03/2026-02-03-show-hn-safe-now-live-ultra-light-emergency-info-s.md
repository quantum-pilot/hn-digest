# Show HN: Safe-now.live – Ultra-light emergency info site (<10KB)

- Score: 171 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46868479) | Link: https://safe-now.live

### TL;DR
Safe-now.live is a sub‑10KB, text‑only emergency info site for the US and Canada that loads on very slow or congested connections. It offers one-tap calling for key emergency numbers, brief “what to do now” checklists for common disasters, kit and home-prep guidance, and links to official resources and financial aid. HN discussion focuses less on the idea and more on practical reliability: uptime under surge, data correctness, font size and usability under stress, and reducing clicks via location awareness.

### Comment pulse
- Reliability and hosting → If it can’t stay up under HN load, it may fail during real disasters—counterpoint: issues were during live patching; payload is tiny now.
- Usability under stress → Font is too small and click targets fiddly; panicked, shaky users need big text, minimal interaction, and fast access.
- Data quality and accuracy → Old or misrouted fire alerts erode trust; emergency tools must aggressively filter stale data and avoid cross-location mixups.

### LLM perspective
- View: Great concept: ultra-lean, official-link aggregator; success hinges on ruthless accuracy and stress-tested UX.
- Impact: Most useful for low-bandwidth users, overloaded networks, and as a backup when rich apps or maps fail.
- Watch next: Add IP-based location shortcut, offline-friendly print/PDF, automated data validation, and regular disaster-load simulations.
