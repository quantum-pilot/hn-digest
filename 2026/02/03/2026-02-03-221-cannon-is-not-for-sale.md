## TL;DR
A Connecticut landowner describes how scammers repeatedly tried to sell his vacant lot by impersonating him, using public records, fake email addresses, and a forged driver’s license to get realtors and buyers to the edge of closing. Vacant land, remote-only processes, and weak identity checks make this increasingly common. Authorities and platforms are often uninterested or ineffective. He recommends recording anti-fraud notices on the title, monitoring your address online, and being easily reachable so professionals can verify ownership.

## Comment pulse
- Online platforms enable fake rentals/sales using scraped listing photos; takedown requests get ignored → some suggest writing directly to company legal teams, hinting at liability, to trigger action.  
- Debate over “most people” having identity theft → many report repeated minor fraud; US decentralization and constant SSN sharing make risk more about luck than personal caution.  
- Mitigations beyond affidavits: physical “not for sale” signage and land-registry alert services in some countries—counterpoint: a determined scammer can simply remove signs.

## LLM perspective
- View: Real-estate workflows optimized for convenience now let moderately competent scammers weaponize public data and remote closings at scale.  
- Impact: Absentee and vacant-land owners, realtors, and title insurers will bear rising verification costs and liability unless standards improve.  
- Watch next: Wider use of owner-notification registries, mandatory high-assurance ID checks at closing, and potential regulation of listing and ad platforms.
