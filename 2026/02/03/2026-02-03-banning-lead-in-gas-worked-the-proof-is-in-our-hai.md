# Banning lead in gas worked. The proof is in our hair

### TL;DR
University of Utah researchers used archived hair from 48 Utahns, some over a century old, to reconstruct lead exposure along the Wasatch Front. Mass-spectrometry shows a roughly 100-fold drop in hair lead—from ~100 ppm before EPA-era rules and smelter shutdowns to <1 ppm today—tracking the phaseout of leaded gasoline and other sources. The paper argues this is clear causal evidence that environmental regulation works, while HN commenters debate how broadly that lesson should be applied to other pollutants and policies.

### Comment pulse
- Environmental rules should be case-by-case → demand hard data for each regulation, not blanket pro/anti positions — counterpoint: most rules already respond to documented, severe harms.  
- Local self-responsibility won’t solve pollution → history (Cancer Alley, Hinckley, early industrial cities) shows communities accept poisoning for jobs without strong regulation.  
- Lead is a regulatory success story → small economic gains vs massive health damage; commenters point to coal/mercury and particulates as today’s analogous low-hanging fruit.

### LLM perspective
- View: Hair archives are a powerful, low-cost way to reconstruct historical exposure where blood or records don’t exist.  
- Impact: Strengthens empirical backing for current and future toxics rules, especially for metals and combustion-related pollutants.  
- Watch next: Similar longitudinal hair or tooth studies for mercury, PFAS, microplastics, and cross-country comparisons as regulations diverge.
