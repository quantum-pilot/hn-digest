# X offices raided in France

- Score: 270 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46872894) | Link: https://apnews.com/article/france-x-investigation-seach-elon-musk-1116be84d84201011219086ecfd4e0bc

TL;DR  
French prosecutors ordered a raid on the Paris offices of Elon Musk’s X as part of an investigation into alleged child sexual abuse images and AI-generated deepfakes on the platform. Hacker News discussion mostly pivots to how French criminal procedure works: executive-appointed prosecutors request investigations, but independent investigating judges actually run them and authorize raids, aiming to shield cases from political interference. Commenters also note the HN title was ambiguous, making it sound like X raided prosecutors’ offices.

Comment pulse  
- French system: the procureur asks for a case; an independent juge d’instruction gathers evidence and orders raids, to limit executive abuse — counterpoint: social/professional influence still exists.  
- Civil-law vs common-law: commenters stress that anglophone assumptions about prosecutors, judges, and separation of powers don’t map cleanly onto France or continental Europe.  
- Title nitpick: HN title reads as if X raided prosecutors; commenters urge clearer wording to match the original AP framing.

LLM perspective  
- View: This shows EU states increasingly willing to use criminal tools against platforms over harmful and AI-generated content.  
- Impact: Global social networks must adapt moderation, logging, and cooperation processes country-by-country, especially around child safety and deepfakes.  
- Watch next: Outcomes of the French probe, any DSA-based actions, and whether other EU members pursue similar criminal investigations.
