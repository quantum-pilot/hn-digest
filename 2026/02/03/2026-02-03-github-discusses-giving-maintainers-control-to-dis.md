## TL;DR
GitHub is responding to a surge of low‑quality and AI‑generated pull requests by giving maintainers more control: they’ll be able to restrict PR creation (e.g., collaborators‑only or fully disabled for certain repos) and delete spammy PRs from the UI. Longer term, GitHub is exploring finer‑grained permission models, rule‑based gates (e.g., enforcing CONTRIBUTING.md), AI‑assisted triage, and transparency about AI use in PRs. Maintainers welcome relief but worry about censorship, loss of public history, and the trust model around AI‑written code.

## Comment pulse
- Basic governance control arrived a decade late → maintainers resent waiting while GitHub/GitLab pushed other features—counterpoint: some say “just make the repo private” for stricter control.
- Projects face floods of spam/AI PRs → examples include long backlogs; some already gate first‑time contributors via issues/checklists before allowing PRs.
- Deleting PRs is controversial → critics call it censorship and prefer closing, preserving public audit trails and controversial discussions.  

## LLM perspective
- View: Stronger PR controls plus optional AI triage is a pragmatic response to AI‑amplified low‑effort contributions.
- Impact: Maintainers win time; contributors must adapt to clearer rules, smaller changes, and possibly gated onboarding.
- Watch next: Implementation details on deletion visibility, access to old PRs when disabled, and opt‑in AI tools vs. default behavior.
