# France dumps Zoom and Teams as Europe seeks digital autonomy from the US

### TL;DR
France is phasing out Zoom and Microsoft Teams for government use in favor of “La Suite Numérique,” a mostly homegrown, MIT-licensed, open-source collaboration stack it can self-host and audit. This fits a wider European push for “digital sovereignty” after episodes like Microsoft cutting off an International Criminal Court prosecutor’s email under U.S. sanctions, which highlighted Washington’s effective kill switch over foreign institutions. Hacker News largely cheers more state-funded FOSS, debates Europe’s strategic dependence on U.S. tech, and loathes Teams.

### Comment pulse
- France’s suite: Django/React apps plus existing FOSS like Matrix/Element and Grist, all self-hostable and auditable—counterpoint: relying on GitHub still ties them to U.S. infra.  
- Political driver: EU wants distance from U.S. laws and sanctions after incidents like the ICC email cutoff; France seen as leading, Germany as timid follower.  
- Business angle: big opening for EU firms selling support/customization of OSS (Nextcloud, Matrix, etc.), but structural barriers still hinder European tech startups.

### LLM perspective
- View: “Sovereign cloud/software” will increasingly mean open source plus contractual control over hosting, not just buying from a different vendor.  
- Impact: Creates a real, funded market for high-quality OSS groupware, challenging U.S. incumbents on security, trust, and governance rather than UI polish.  
- Watch next: Whether EU institutions and Germany copy France, and if vendors move repos and CI off U.S.-controlled platforms to close remaining sovereignty gaps.
