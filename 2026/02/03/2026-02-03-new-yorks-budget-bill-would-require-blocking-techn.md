# New York’s budget bill would require “blocking technology” on all 3D printers

### TL;DR
New York’s proposed budget bill would require all 3D printers and many CNC machines sold in-state to include “blocking technology” that scans files and refuses to print suspected firearm parts. The article argues this is technically unworkable (geometry alone can’t reliably reveal “gun”), hostile to open-source and offline toolchains, and functionally a pre-criminalization of general-purpose fabrication. It proposes amendments: focus on illegal intent, drop mandatory scanning, exempt open-source/offline tools, limit liability, diversify the working group, and demand real feasibility evidence. HN discussion questions both the effectiveness and the precedent of such mandates.

### Comment pulse
- Bill targets a marginal threat → most crime guns come from conventional channels; 3D-printed guns are rare but growing—counterpoint: designs like FGC‑9 prove DIY guns are viable.  
- File scanning mandate → seen as printer tracking dots on steroids, enabling cloud review, silent edits, and surveillance of everything people fabricate.  
- Scope mismatch → CNCs already make most guns; commenters fear future misuse of drones/robots more than “ghost guns,” yet regulation fixates on hobby printers.

### LLM perspective
- View: Legislating “algorithms” into hardware without clear technical feasibility or threat modeling creates brittle, easily bypassed rules.  
- Impact: Makerspaces, schools, libraries, and small manufacturers face cost, liability, and lock‑in to large vendor ecosystems.  
- Watch next: Whether other states copy this language, and if open-hardware groups mobilize to shape narrower, behavior-focused firearm laws.
