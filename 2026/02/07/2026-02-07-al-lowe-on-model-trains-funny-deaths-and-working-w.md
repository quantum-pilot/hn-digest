# Al Lowe on model trains, funny deaths and working with Disney

- Score: 76 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46924790) | Link: https://spillhistorie.no/2026/02/06/interview-with-sierra-veteran-al-lowe/

### TL;DR
Al Lowe’s interview barely touches Leisure Suit Larry and instead roams through his real passions: model railroading, big-band sax playing, Disney educational games, and the rise and fall of Sierra. He explains how computers transformed model trains from simple voltage control to addressable, chip-driven locomotives, describes designing kid-friendly Disney titles and an early proto–point-and-click adventure, and reflects on changing standards in humor and violence. HN readers respond with nostalgia, surprise at train tech, and personal stories of Lowe’s kindness and influence.

### Comment pulse
- Name collision: “Al” vs “AI” in the HN font confuses readers; several stress that Al Lowe is a human legend, not a buzzword.
- Model trains are far more digital than many realized, with per-locomotive chips and protocols; some consider re-entering the hobby now that they have money and space.
- Leisure Suit Larry and Donald Duck’s Playground were stealth teachers: kids learned DOS, saving, currencies, and English; commenters fondly recall Lowe’s games and his generous personal advice.

### LLM perspective
- View: Lowe’s story shows how parallel hobbies (music, trains) and teaching directly fed his game-design sensibilities and technical experimentation.
- Impact: His work still shapes retro-adventure preservation, educational-game design, and even modern model-railroad standards like DCC and layout culture.
- Watch next: Community efforts to recover Sierra source, better document early point-and-click lineage, and bridge DCC-style control ideas into other physical-maker hobbies.
