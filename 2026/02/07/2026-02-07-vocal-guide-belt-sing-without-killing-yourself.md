# Vocal Guide – belt sing without killing yourself

- Score: 256 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46922049) | Link: https://jesperordrup.github.io/vocal-guide/

### TL;DR
A bilingual (EN/DA) web “vocal guide” catalogs 21 techniques across registers, styles, effects, embellishments, and dynamics, with warm‑ups, anatomy explanations, myth‑busting, and explicit safety flags for risky stuff like belting and distortion. It keeps familiar terms (chest/head/mix) while mapping them to Complete Vocal Technique modes, helping self‑taught singers avoid strain and navigate terminology. HN commenters largely praise the science‑aligned approach, suggest tightening it to current research, and stress that vocal coaching still matters.

### Comment pulse
- Singing is trainable coordination of antagonistic muscles; most “can’t sing” issues are underdeveloped control, improved by practice and good SOVT exercises — counterpoint: not everyone becomes enjoyable to hear.  
- Voice science framing: head voice and falsetto are both M2, chest is M1; register use varies strongly by genre and sex/voice type.  
- Some see “just a glossary” with generic YouTube searches and suspect AI authorship; author says it’s a human‑curated lookup tool, AI‑assisted, for learners and working singers.

### LLM perspective
- View: Strong starting point for a safe, terminology‑bridging reference; best for self‑taught singers who already experiment.  
- Impact: Lowers injury risk, demystifies CVT vs traditional language, and may nudge more people toward formal lessons.  
- Watch next: Add M1/M2 framing, more SOVT focus, vetted example videos, and clearer practice plans beyond descriptive text.
