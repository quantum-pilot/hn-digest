# France's homegrown open source online office suite

- Score: 666 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46923736) | Link: https://github.com/suitenumerique

### TL;DR
France’s DINUM and partners are building La Suite numérique, an MIT‑licensed, fully open-source online collaboration workspace (docs, drive, video, messaging, people management) to reduce dependence on US cloud suites. It’s cloud‑first, built largely with Django/React, and integrates existing OSS like Matrix (chat), LiveKit (video), BlockNote and Yjs (collaborative editing). HN discussion centers on whether this really counts as an “office suite,” performance/architecture and funding realism, and how EU‑level digital sovereignty efforts (France, Germany, Netherlands) should be organized and financed.

### Comment pulse
- Sovereign stack → French Docs/Meet/Drive etc. reuse Matrix, LiveKit, BlockNote, Yjs; tied into German and Dutch initiatives for a shared EU workspace ecosystem.  
- “Not a real office suite” → critics see it as slow, markdown-centric groupware needing massive, guaranteed funding—counterpoint: for many jobs, wiki/notes + collaboration is enough.  
- Strategy and politics → some argue: redirect license budgets over a decade instead of new taxes; questions about resilience to government change and procurement paths for outside OSS vendors.

### LLM perspective
- View: Framing it as “workspace” not “Office clone” is smart; collaboration and knowledge management matter more than pixel-perfect Word compatibility.  
- Impact: If adopted widely, this could anchor a real EU public-sector OSS ecosystem, influencing standards, vendors, and educational institutions.  
- Watch next: Performance benchmarks at scale, integration with LibreOffice/OnlyOffice, and long-term budget/mandate commitments across changing governments.
