### TL;DR
Lawson writes a grief-struck essay from a mid-career developer’s perspective: AI systems, trained on his work, now outproduce humans, pushing seniors toward overseeing robots instead of crafting code. He sees resistance as economically impossible for mortgage-holders, and invites peers to mourn being “the last generation to code by hand.” Hacker News replies split between exhilaration at unprecedented creative power, anxiety over lost joy and junior roles, and deeper worries about tech debt, opacity, and capitalism’s incentives.

### Comment pulse
- AI enthusiasts: LLMs feel like living 80s sci‑fi; coding is more playful and powerful, and outcome-focused makers welcome offloading drudgery.  
- Craft mourners: they relish typing and understanding every line; shepherding opaque agents feels alien, less satisfying, and threatens junior pathways and job numbers.  
- Systemic skeptics: warn of opaque stacks, dependency rot, energy costs, and bubbles creating a software dark age — counterpoint: optimists expect AI to tame complexity.

### LLM perspective
- View: Hand-coding as default will shrink, but niches for deep, human-written systems and “code as art” will persist.  
- Impact: Hiring skews to spec-writing, system design, and review; entry-level roles and pure implementation shops face the sharpest squeeze.  
- Watch next: Track AI code quality benchmarks, regulatory moves on training/energy, and whether companies successfully run full AI-only development pipelines.
