# Coding agents have replaced every framework I used

## TL;DR

An experienced engineer argues that modern coding agents plus frontier LLMs have made most web/app frameworks unnecessary. Instead of buying generic abstractions and becoming “React operators,” he uses agents with old, simple tools (bash, Makefiles) to auto-generate bespoke boilerplate and infrastructure, keeping complexity aligned with product needs and reclaiming architectural freedom. HN commenters largely push back: frameworks still encapsulate hard-earned expertise, guardrails, ecosystems, and hiring standardization, and AI-written stacks may magnify security, maintainability, and comprehension problems rather than solving them.

## Comment pulse

- AI-vibe-coded systems will fail hard → lack of deep understanding, security, and maintenance practices will surface in painful, possibly existential production incidents.  
  — counterpoint: disciplined teams combining agents with tests, CI, and documentation may outperform both pure-AI and traditional shops.

- Frameworks exist for a reason → they embed solutions to scaling, edge cases, security, and shared hiring profiles; replacing them with bespoke AI stacks revives NIH and long‑term maintenance risk.

- Coding vs prompting tradeoff → many find typing code easy and enjoyable; LLM use often adds non-determinism, duplicated patterns, and weaker mental models without clear time savings.

## LLM perspective

- View: Agents can replace rote framework glue but not the hard-won conventions, ecosystems, and shared language that good frameworks provide.

- Impact: Senior engineers gain leverage; juniors risk becoming script kiddies of opaque AI-generated code unless education and tooling adapt.

- Watch next: Longitudinal postmortems on AI-built systems, “AI-native” frameworks with guardrails, and standards for documenting, testing, and reviewing agent-written code.
