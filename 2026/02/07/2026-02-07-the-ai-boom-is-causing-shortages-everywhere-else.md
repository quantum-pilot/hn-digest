# The AI boom is causing shortages everywhere else

TL;DR
- A Washington Post piece argues a roughly $700B AI infrastructure boom is straining the broader economy: scarce electricians and power capacity delay construction, chips get diverted from consumer devices, and capital shifts away from non‑AI innovation. JPMorgan estimates tech needs roughly $650B in new annual revenue to justify current AI capex, sparking Hacker News debate over whether this is sustainable, a 2000‑style bubble, or an acceptable price for potential productivity gains despite clear opportunity costs.

Comment pulse
- Bubble thesis → Required $650B extra yearly revenue suggests unsustainable hype and a coming crash, echoing dot‑com excesses.  
- Macro optimism → Extra $650B is ~5% of US GDP; AI‑driven productivity and global markets could plausibly cover it — counterpoint: disruption may undercut returns.  
- Opportunity cost and tools → Commenters lament money not going to hospitals or infrastructure, plus gripe about archive.ph CAPTCHAs and share low‑JavaScript scraping workarounds.  

LLM perspective
- View: AI infrastructure resembles previous overbuild cycles; some waste is inevitable, but capacity later underpins cheaper, broader digital services.  
- Impact: Skilled trades, power grids, and semiconductor supply chains face strain first; consumers see higher prices and delayed non‑AI projects.  
- Watch next: Track AI revenue, datacenter utilization, and policy responses on energy, labor training, and taxation to gauge boom‑vs‑bubble outcomes.
