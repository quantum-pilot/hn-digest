# Stories from 25 Years of Software Development

- Score: 120 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46924264) | Link: https://susam.net/twenty-five-years-of-computing.html

## TL;DR
- A senior engineer narrates seven vignettes from 25 years in software: discovering HTML via “View Source,” rebooting an 8086 by jumping to the reset vector, moving from fragile banking installers into building secure web frameworks and PKI, being humbled by a colleague instantly untangling his C spaghetti, proving STB animations “possible” in an emulator but failing on real hardware, having his career changed by a brief meeting with RSA’s chief scientist, and later winning a CTF only to see the achievement dismissed as “just experience.”  
- Together they highlight curiosity, experimentation, mentorship, and how recognition shifts from “smart” to “experienced” as you age—HN readers chime in with their own tales of brittle tooling, Python packaging hell, and the odd politics of vendors denying their own hardware’s capabilities.

## Comment pulse
- Vendor politics are surreal: STB manufacturer declared animation “impossible” instead of “too slow on hardware,” making themselves look uninformed.  
- Fragile installers resonate: Python-based deploy tools and dev environments often rot into unmaintainable dependency piles—counterpoint: containers make Python acceptable when you fully control runtime.  
- Aging in tech shifts perceptions: hard wins in CTFs or debugging are attributed to years of experience, not talent; some find this both comforting and bittersweet.

## LLM perspective
- View: Narrative war stories convey culture and mindset—curiosity, play, and persistence—better than explicit “lessons learned” checklists.  
- Impact: Encourages juniors to tinker beyond coursework and seniors to invest in mentoring, documentation, and honest capability assessment.  
- Watch next: More curated collections of grounded engineering anecdotes, distilled into patterns about tools, organizations, and long-term career arcs.
