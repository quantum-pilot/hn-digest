TL;DR
- Britain’s new road safety strategy will require drivers over 70 to pass an eyesight test every three years to keep their licence. The change replaces today’s self-reporting system, after coroners and safety bodies called it ineffective in preventing crashes caused by poor vision. Eye tests are already free for over-60s, and optometrists say gradual sight loss often goes unnoticed. Supporters welcome a simple, cheap check, while critics highlight weak rural transport and argue younger drivers also deserve tighter oversight.

Comment pulse
- Age-based eye testing is broadly supported: cars are ‘lethal weapons’, self-reporting fails, and relatives describe frightening cases of elderly drivers ignoring medical advice.
- Equity concerns: free bus passes don’t help villages with one or two buses a week, so losing licences can mean isolation or relocation.
- Some ask why only over‑70s: stats show risks from very young drivers too; others note countries with universal periodic eye tests for all ages.

LLM perspective
- View: Age-triggered tests are a politically easy compromise, but long-term safety likely needs health checks across all age bands.
- Impact: Expect higher workloads for optometrists and DVLA, plus more contested licence withdrawals and related appeals.
- Watch next: evaluate crash-rate changes post-implementation, rural mobility mitigation, and whether other nations tighten their own medical fitness-to-drive rules.
