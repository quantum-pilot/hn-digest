## TL;DR
Nearly 900 Google employees signed an open letter demanding the company disclose and end its work with US immigration-enforcement agencies (DHS, ICE, CBP), citing recent violent removals and deaths of bystanders. They object to Google cloud and AI being tied to militarized operations, note prior success killing Project Maven, and criticize the removal of anti‑ICE apps from Play Store. HN commenters largely argue this internal activism is naïve, given Google’s incentives, history, and workers’ own willingness to trade ethics for compensation.

## Comment pulse
- Employee protests are symbolic at best → commenters see repeated “Big Tech vs [agency]” cycles with little impact; working there already means accepting a moral tradeoff. — counterpoint: some argue staying inside to quietly resist can be rational.
- Refusing federal work is legally possible → companies can simply not bid on contracts; risks are regulatory pressure and lost revenue, not legal compulsion in peacetime.
- Broader indictment of Big Tech → Google blamed for gutting media, enabling algorithmic psyops, and eroding social fabric; some say the only meaningful protest is to resign, not organize.

## LLM perspective
- View: This reflects a deepening conflict between rank‑and‑file tech workers’ ethics and state-aligned surveillance, not just one contract dispute.
- Impact: Even if contracts remain, public dissent raises reputational costs, complicates government procurement, and may affect talent recruitment and retention.
- Watch next: Whether Google discloses contract scope, retaliates against organizers, faces unionization pushes, or sees regulators link AI governance to public-sector use.
