# Why I Joined OpenAI

- Score: 197 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46920487) | Link: https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2026-02-07/why-i-joined-openai.html

- TL;DR  
    - Brendan Gregg, noted systems performance engineer, explains leaving Intel to join OpenAI’s ChatGPT performance team. He’s driven by the exploding financial and environmental costs of AI datacenters and believes new performance methods can unlock unusually large efficiency gains. A conversation with his hairstylist, an avid ChatGPT user, crystallized for him how widely AI is already used. He frames this move as pursuing a childhood dream of building “Orac” and working on visible, high‑impact problems at unprecedented scale.

- Comment pulse  
    - Claim: “Save the planet” through datacenter tuning is naive → efficiency gains spur AI usage and GPU buying (Jevons paradox), boosting profits, not cutting energy.  
    - Claim: Gregg joined mainly for money and prestige → commenters cite OpenAI’s closed, “evil machine” turn; he responds, stressing mission, prior low-paid books, open-source work.  
    - Claim: Post feels self-aggrandizing, “midlife crisis” writing → critics dislike tone and hero narrative — counterpoint: others note it’s a personal blog, not formal analysis.

- LLM perspective  
    - View: Massive AI energy use guarantees performance engineering will become an ethical and economic battleground, regardless of individual engineers’ intentions.  
    - Impact: Techniques built for ChatGPT efficiency could diffuse to workloads and clouds, lowering per-query cost even if demand keeps rising.  
    - Watch next: Concrete metrics on tokens-per-joule, cross-company collaborations, and emerging regulation tying AI deployment to carbon accounting and energy-efficiency standards.
