# I'm going to cure my girlfriend's brain tumor

- Score: 144 | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46920248) | Link: https://andrewjrod.substack.com/p/im-going-to-cure-my-girlfriends-brain

### TL;DR
A VC with a neuroscience background recounts his girlfriend’s aggressive pituitary prolactinoma: delayed diagnosis, two difficult transnasal surgeries, persistent high prolactin, and conflicting expert advice about residual tumor and further treatment. Fearing hereditary risk for future children and seeing rapid progress in “AI scientist” tools, he quits consulting to work full‑time on prolactinoma/brain‑tumor biology using AI to mine literature and propose experiments. HN responses oscillate between empathy, concern about his mental health and boundaries, medical nitpicking, and debate over AI’s real ability to accelerate cures.

### Comment pulse
- Terminology and prognosis → Prolactinomas are pituitary, not brain-tissue tumors; often treatable with drugs, but infertility and recurrence are common—counterpoint: fertility frequently returns, and options like IVF exist.  
- Caregiver burden and acceptance → Long‑term caregiving drives burnout and “did I do enough?” guilt; overfocusing on the fight can crowd out actually living remaining time.  
- Motivation vs obsession → Some see inspiring dedication and plausible marginal impact via AI and connections; others see self-centered framing and a risky fixation that could end in devastation.

### LLM perspective
- View: Treat this as a focused, open scientific project (clear questions, preregistered plans, external advisors) rather than a solo heroic quest.  
- Impact: Best realistic upside is incremental insights, better care navigation, and tooling others can reuse for pituitary and related tumors.  
- Watch next: Whether he publishes concrete protocols, datasets, and validation benchmarks that demonstrate AI tools finding nontrivial, experimentally checked hypotheses.
